118296,"I think the sun shade should be facing the outside of the car because it would reflect the sun and the not shiny side would be facing the inside. If the not shiny side is facing out than the shiny side would not reflect on the sun, and the car would be warmer than it would be if the shiny side was facing out.

Katie ",3
118300,You want it in your car because it reflects the sun from burning your inside of your car.,4
118302,The shiny part of the sun shade should go on the outside of the car because the shiny part reflexes the solar heat coming into the car when Laura is outside on a summer day.,2
118310,i think the sun shade should face out of the car so the shiny part makes the sun not hit the car.,3
118304,"That way, the shiny part will deflect the heat.",2
118313,Shiny fabric absorbs more sunlight than the dull colored fabric.,3
118319,because the sun will reflect of the shiny side and keep the hot air out.,4
118297,so the refelects and hits something else.,3
118298,I pick toward the inside of the car because it will make the outside hot but not the inside.,2
118311,because the shiny part will reflect back,3
118305,it will block the sun away from laura car.,3
118293,It should face out of the car because the shiny side will reflect the sun light away from the car making it coolar.,4
118299,Well the problem having a sun shade on the outside of your car is that someone might steal it or might just want to take while your out somewhere and you leave your sun shade out.So that is my prediction.,2
118309,because its the inside your trying to keep it cold not outside,2
118307,Because the shiny part reflects the sun off.,4
118306,"i think laura might want to make the shine part face the out side because, it will riflect the sun back out ",4
118308,if you had it facing towards the inside of the car it would just let the sun right through,2
118321,"Out the car because if put the sun shade toward the car,the car will get hot,and if you put the sun shade out the car the sun will reflect of the car,and it could stay cool in the inside.",4
118312,It should face out of the car because the shiny part will make it warm.,2
118318,my answer is the second picture because that can keep the car cool and the sun cant heat up the car and it can stay cool.,2
118303,I think that the sun shade that has the shiny part facing out of the car because if it was facing towards the car the shine part would shine the light and heat in the car which would make the car hot in side of the car. ,3
118314,so it dosn't blow away ,2
118301,I think inside because the shiny part will attract the sun and she wants to keep the sun away.,3
118316,the shiny part should face the inside of the car because it will reflect it off of the car,2
118320,This is my answer because it blocks more sunlight from coming into the car.,3
118294,0,1
118315,this way the sun light reflects OUT of the car,4
118323,I think the shiny part should face the inside of the car because I think the shiny part atract more sunlight and to prevent the car from being really hot she should put the other sine facing out because it atracts less sun light.,3
118482,0,1
118478,If the sun reaflects off the wind shealed the car won't heat up as much.,4
118479,inside so it wont get hot,2
118480,Then it can reflect the sun off the car and it wont be hot inside the car.,4
118473,becuse in the out side the wind will blow it away,2
118474,ityhjmgbovietrhsybgjv8octeiwoyh;eriu,1
118483, The Sun's heat will reflect off of the car.,2
118470,That way the sun will reflect away from the car back outside.,4
118472,0,1
118468,Keeping the shiny part out of the car makes it so the heat reflects off of the car into somewhere away from the car and if you put the non-shiny part so it is facing the car it would make it so the car would get hotter,3
118475,The shiny part will reflect the light- heating up the car.,4
118477,I chose toward the outside because the silver has a reflection on it if you turn it outside the sun is going to hit your car but its going to face somewhere else instead of your car because you put it outside.,4
118465,"It will deflect the light and heat away from the car, keeping it cooler, while the dark side on the inside will suck all the heat from the cabin of the car.",3
118487,shiny surfaces reflect the sun so you wan it facing out,4
118488,I think it should be like this because the sun will reflect from the shiny part back out ,3
118486,I think it should be facing out of the car because the shiny part can reflect the sun off of it so it doesn't get as hot.,4
118484,"I think this because,if the sicky side is in the in side it would not be good.",2
118485,I think its because it can reflect the suns shine and heat.,2
118490,because the fabric shiny thing keeps the sun facing a different direction and keeps the hot air out and cool inside ,3
118467,Because nobody can steal it and because it keeps the inside not get hot.,2
118471,"Shiny things also reflect heat.
",2
118469,0,1
118466,"shiny things also attract light.  so if you wanted to keep your car cool you would use a light colored, not shiny one.",3
118543,if you have it out of the car would have less protection,2
118515,i think it should face the outside because it would probably just reflect off because it is shiny. ,3
118517,"Out of the car so the sun dosn't reflect into the car and reflects away from the car.
",4
118533,because you want the suns rays to reflect of the car,4
118518,The shiny part should shine outside of your car because the shiny part will deflect the sun rays and it will keep your car cooler. ,3
118548,I think the shiny part should stay in because if the shiny part is out the sun can reflect on it.,4
118522,the heat can reflect it,2
118562,"if the sun shines on black it makes the color hot
",3
118526,I picked this answer because the shine part is better on the outside.I know this because the sun likes the shiny part and the sun light reflects off the shiny part.,4
118567,"it should face out of the car,so it reflects the light back out.",4
118516,I think it should face out of the car because when it is shiney it shines on the inside of the car ,2
118521,it will keep the temperature inside the car and the soft side will reflect the light away from the sun,4
118520,The shiny will get into the car and it will be hot.,2
118514,"The shiny side of the sunshade will reflect the sunlight, so it will bounce off the sunshade, and not be able to get into the car keeping the interior cooler than the outside of the car.",4
118512,I think the shinny part will reflect the light which causes heat.,4
118509,The sun will reflect away.,3
118534,because in the outside the cover will create more heat for the car but in the inside the car will not have as much heat as the outside.,2
118519,because then the car will be hot inside  and out side will be hot.,2
118511,I think this answer because it makes the car hotter if you put the shiny side out it will jut make the car hotter. Well that's just my upinion ,2
118542,it should point out of the car because then the sun can reflect of the shiny part and the sun will hit something else ,4
118537,I think it should face out of the car because it will allow the sun to reflect it somewhere else.,4
118529,I think that it should go out of the car because the sun will shine and reflect back.,4
118536,"The shiny part reflects the sunlight, so the sun won't get in the car.",4
118523,the shiny part should be outside soit could reflect the sun,4
118530,because if she put it toward is better and i think toward the car because i sew some people that put them inside the car so i think she might put itn toward the inside the car.,2
118510,It will reflect heat of it is pointing towards the sun.,4
118513,the shiny part will take the heat and not the car.,2
118556,I think that because the tinfoil thing will deflect the sun and go away.,3
118549,i think that it should face out of the car because if the shiny side was pointing inside of the car it will get hot but if it is not facing inside the car the shade will make it cool,2
118607,the shiny side of the sun shade will reflect light out of the car.,4
118622,"The shiny part is like a mirror therefor it would reflect heat, I also see that in other's cars very often.",3
118604,now metal is not warming up,2
118614,she should put it on the outside of the car because if the shiny part is facing out the car it wnt be shining heat into the car,2
118628,"When you put it on the inside it stops the sun from bleaching the inside, but when it is on the outside the sun could eat the material.",3
118632,0,1
118602,i chose out of the because the sun would reaflect of of the shiny part and not heat up the car.,4
118600,It will reflect the light.,4
118623,She should have the shiny side facing the outside because the light will reflect off of it.,4
118613,the shiny reflects the   sun,4
118610,so the light will reflect off the shiny part and go somewhere else,4
118618,I think it should be facing the outside of the car because the shiny material will reflect the light from the sun and make the car less hot,4
118626,"   I think that because if the shiny part faces the inside it will make it more hot, and if it faces the outside it will make it less hot in the car.",2
118621,0,1
118611,0,1
118606,because it will reflect the light away,4
118620,it can get past on outside and wind.,2
118616,I choice the inside of the car because the windshield is suppose to protect the sun from shinning inside through the front window . The heat won't effect the car as much.,2
118601,The screen might reflect light.,4
118615,"Because if it is pointing towards the inside of the car, then that is going to make it hot.",2
118624,0,1
118634,0,1
118609,It'll observe more heat to keep car cool,2
118612,poque elotro lado es oscuro,2
118947,0,1
118344,I chose the inside of the car cause some one can steal it and your car will get really really hot,2
118337,I chose my answer because the shiny part is like a mirror and mirrors reflect and you would want to reflct the sun out of the car.,4
118358,Because the suns energy will reflect right off the car.,4
118350,The shiny part should face the outside of the car because shiny colors reflect more light and if it is facing the outside than it will reflect the light away from the car.,4
118353,It should be out of the car so that the sun can reflecked out,4
118346,The shiny stuff will refreat the heat and light.,3
118366,shiny side is reflectant,3
118352,The shiny part should be outside because it will abosrb the heat.,2
118355,it reflects the heat.,3
118338,"Its kind of like a mirror, it attracts the heat and then shoves the heat off [reflects]. If it reflects off the sun then the heat wont get in the car through the windshield.",4
118348,I chose that because you want the shiny part facing the outside of the car so it wouldn't be as hot.,2
118349,so you dont ruin your cover.,2
118354,because the heat will inside not otside,2
118351,The shiny side should be on the inside because the light will bounce off the shiny part.,3
118361,0,1
118345,It should face out because it will reflect the heat and light  ,4
118341,The shiny side should point outward because it will reflect the heat away from the car.,3
118367,because if you put it outside the sun can make the shade hot and the sun would come through it ,3
118343,"The shiny part is like solar panels, it deflects the sun. Therefor, the sun won't get in the car and make the inside of the car hot.",3
118357,because it would refleckt the sun light,4
118369,So the energy of the sun can bounce of the car and in that way give it shade.,3
118339,It should face out because it will absorb heat better.,2
118372,I think the dull would make the car even hotter beacouse the shiny reflects.,3
118360,because the sun will reflect of the shiny part and the heat will bounce of and not atract heat.,4
118356,The shiny part will reflect light away from the car ,4
118347,So she could not let heat inside the car and not get annoyed by the heat.,2
118371,The shiny part because the dark shiny part is darker then the other side sothe sun id on the sheild and not the car  ,3
118368,out the car,2
118364,it will reflect the sun,4
118362,To reflect the sun out.,4
118397,I think it should be facing out of the car because I see cars with sun shades facing out of the car all the time.,2
118393, The reason the shiny part should be out of the car because it will reflect the sun and it won't take in the heat of the sun.Also if the side that is not shiny it will take in the warmness of the sun which will make it even hotter.,4
118417,because the solor engery will bounce of the car.,3
118403,it should face the outside of the car because then the sun will only reflect on that and not on the car as much .,4
118410,it wont atrack heat,2
118392,well if the shiny part faces the sun the shiny part would reflect the suns light and the car wont get too hot,4
118394,The shiny part reflects light so the car stays cool because the sunlight is not coming inside the car.The car has shade when the shade is up.,4
118413,The out side of the car because when the sun hits the shiny part of the sun shade the sun will bounce right off of the sun shade and go back tored the sun,3
118408,so it will not go throw,2
118409,because it will make the car less hot and it will be cool inside the car,2
118401,The outside because the shade reflects the sunlight away from the car.,3
118405,it should face the out side of the car because then it obsores the sun light on the shinny side and it wont heat the car . But if you put the shinny side facing the inside of the car it will heat the inside of the car .,3
118402,Because the sun is reflecting of the shiny part,4
118406,"The shiny side should be outside the car because, if its inside the window well take in the heat and push it inside the car, but if its outside it will block the heat before it touches the window.",2
118400,The shiny side should face out of the car because the shine gets sun rays attracted and if the shiny part faces the car the car will be hot.,3
118415,I chose this answer because the shiny side will reflect light out ,4
118398,I think out the car because if it has toward the car it would get hot but it has out the car the car would be could,2
118395,Toward the outside so the rays from the sun don't go in and they reflect of of the shiny side.,4
118412,so the sun wont heat up  the inside of the car,3
118391,It should face out side the car because it reflects the sunlight flashing it somewhere else.,4
118411,The shiny part reflects the light and heat,4
118407,It will reflect the light.,4
118414,The shiny side absorbs heat.,2
118418,The shine would reflect and make the heat go away.,3
118416,she should put them out of the car because then it would keep the sun out,2
118396,"put  it toward the window
",2
118419,"Yes,but it inside of the car because so it wont be that hot.",2
118404,the wind will blow it or a person can take it.,2
118439,"If the shade faces the outside of the car it reflects light, but if it faces the inside the gray side will let it in.",4
118437,If its shining in the car it makes the car hotter,2
118438,The shine of the sun shade will attract the sun and make her car hot if she left the shiny part facing the outside of the car. If she wants to keep it normal temperature she should face the shiny part on the inside of the car,3
118443,The reflection of the sun can heat up the car because the reflection of the sun is like the sun it self but not really.,4
118456,"It's better to let it face out because when the sun reflects it, the heat bounces off the shiny part.",3
118455,the light and heat will reflect off of her car to keep it cool.,4
118446,"The shiny, aluminum-like part of the sun shade should face the outside of the window to reflect the light away from the cars interior.",4
118440,"I think that when Laura puts the sunshade up she should put them in the inside of the car because if you put them on the outside one someone could steal it, two if there is wind it could blow away, three it will heat the shade up and eventully the car will be hot",2
118451,So the sun reflet off of the  car.,3
118462,i think toward the outside of the car because then the sun will catch on the shiny part and reflect away from the car,4
118442,so the sun reflects off the shiny part,4
118447,The shiny part is reflecting the sun out of the car,4
118441,The shiny fabric will delflect the heat.,2
118452,i think that it should point twords the outside of the car because it deflects the sun,3
118461,The heat will be reflected by the shiny side.,3
118460,Because then if it is on the shiny side it can atrack sunlight and then get hot.,3
118464,toward the outside of the car so then the shiny isn't  facing the car so then it is net hot,2
118453,Because the shiny part would not let the hot part of the sun in the car the unshiny side would.,3
118458,The light reflecting of the shiny side will go into the car and heat it from the glare if place towards the inside of the car.,4
118454,It will reflect the sun away.,4
118457,put in side the car because if u put it inside it will get hot in the car,2
118445,"I would shine the sun shade out of the car because it would deflect the heat and if I would turn it in towards the car, it would magnify the heat in the car (like a magnifying glass).",2
118450,I think it should be on the outside of the car because if it was on the inside it would absorb the heat and reflect inside making the car hot.,3
118459, you put inside the car because it has material so it could protect was inside not the inside.,2
118463,because the suns light will reflect from the shiny part the sun shade ,4
118448,The shiny side would reflect the suns rays and not absorb as much heat.,4
118444,the shiny side will deflect the light like a mirror,3
118476,I think outside to keep the hotness outside of the car,2
118481,then the sun will reflect off the shade.,4
118535,"if the shiny part was facing out, the sun will bounce off of the sun shade and not onto the car.",3
118540,The shiny side goes on the outside because it will deflect the sunlight from the car so the car doesn't heat up and the not shiny side should face on the inside.,3
118544,because the sun and heat will reflect of of it,4
118527,so the heat will reflect of of the shiny part so the heat will not be in the car it will be out of the car.,2
118557,If the shiny part faces the outside of the car than the sunlight will reflect the sunlight away from the car.,4
118528,to reflect the sun away from the car,4
118531,I think that it should be facing the outside of the car because it will deflect the sun because it is made of aluminum.,3
118524, The shiny side of the windshield should face the outside of the car because the shiny side reflects the sun.,4
118545,I have seen dome people have them inside mostly. If you leave it outside it might get stolen.,2
118558,Out of the car because the the window doesn't get hot and so does the light fabric.,2
118561,If the the shiny part of the windshield shade faces outside of the car it'll reflect the heat away from the car.,3
118525,shinyness reflects the solar energy off,4
118539,it will reflect the light towards the sun. If the non shiny was there it would go through.,3
118554,reflection,2
118566,The sun will reflect on the shiny part and make it heat up alot.,4
118565,0,1
118550,"It will repel the heat from the outside, in.",2
118551,I think that it should face outside because it will reflect off of it.,3
118547,so the windsield outside the window gets warm not the window ,2
118560,it shold be inside ,2
118568,porque nocalienta el caro,2
118553,it's going to be out because the the shiny part is going to heat it up in there so it's inside the car,2
118546,The sun reflects off of anything shiny so you have have the sun shade facing towards the sun so that the car doesn't get hot.,4
118538,The heat wont be able to get inside the car.,2
118552,i don't know,1
118563,I said outside because the shiny part absorbs the heat and un-shiny keeps out the heat.,2
118555,it would be toward the inside of the car because the light would bereflecting to the glass to th esun,4
118569,I think that the inside because if you put the screen on the outside people could steal it.,2
118571,"the shiny part reflects the sun in a different direction,so if it is facing out of the car than it will reflect the sun",4
118559,i dont know,1
118564,Because so the outside will be hot.,2
118570,0,1
118585,because its helpful to reject the light,3
118590,the shiny part will reflect the suns rays,4
118575,it will face out of the car because the shiny part will reflect the light.,4
118594,because if you put it like that outside it wont do any effect and if you put it inside it well keep it cool,2
118586,"because you want to use the sun shade 
",2
118595,having them toward the inside of the car because then the sun wouldn't come in and if there inside the car there more safe.,2
118578,toward the inside of the car so the sunlight bouncing off the window wont reach the inside of the car as much.,3
118593,Since the shiny part is not facing the car it will not heat up,2
118582,so it can reflect,3
118587,l think the windsheld should go on the outside because thats how it`s suposed to go,2
118588,Because the shiny part reflects the sun in lie a doorway for it.,4
118589,The shiny part will reflect the sunlight of the windshield and keep heat from the sun out of the car.,2
118579,It should face out the car because the shiny side will reflect light.,4
118603,if its facing outside of the car it wont be as hot,2
118592,It will cover the inside so that the car from the inside will not get to hot. ,2
118584,I chose this because the sun will reflect off shiny side outside of the car ,4
118576,You should face the shiny part outside so the sun reflect off of it.,4
118599,It is better because if it is outside the windshield would be more hot and if it was inside it would be a little bit of hot.,2
118577,"The shiny part will reflect light and not allow the car to heat
",4
118591,it should be out of the car so it gets the suns energy,3
118580,"because the sun cant get in.

",3
118598,"It should be facing out of the car because if it's facing towards the car, it'll heat the car up.",2
118581,It should be in the car so that it doesn't get hot and let the car get hot.,2
118619,So they don't heat the inside of the car,2
118608,"The sun shades shiny side should face the inside because the the non-shiny side will help to cool the steering wheel because the shiny part will help block even if it come out of the soft side.
",2
118597,she needs to put the shinny part outside so it dose not get hot,2
118630,if she toward the inside of the car the seets of the car are going to bee fresh.,2
118583,so it does not reaflect into the car,3
118637,because if it was toward the inside it will be hot,2
119017,To reflect the sun away.,4
118296,The shiny part should be facing out so that it reflects heat away from the car.,3
118300,Because you don't want the heat to get in your car.,2
118302,If the shiny part where to be facing the inside of the car then the Sun shade would have no use. So the shiny part would have to face the outside of the car so that the Sun could reflect of the Sun shade.,4
118310,i know that the shiny part should face outside and not inwards the car to make the sun bounce off the car to keep it cool and not keep the seats or wheel burning hot.,3
118304,It should face out so the SR is deflected.,3
118313,"Shiny parts will absorb sunlight and make the car hot so if I put the dull side out, it will not absorb much radiation.",3
118319,the shiny side is the reflective side so you want it to reflect the heat out.,3
118297,Because she wants the sunlight outside if her car to stay outside by using a reflector to keep the sunlight off the car.,3
118298,It should be toward the inside of the car because the sun will bounce away from the car.,3
118311,out of the car because when the sunlight hits the wind shield the solar energy reflects back and keeps the car from heating up.,4
118305,it has to be inside so it won't get hot inside.,2
118293,Well the shiny side reflects light but the other side dose not so you would want to reflect the sun light away from the car. ,4
118299,Well if you had on the outside someone might steal it or it might just nor stay on but if you had on the inside it would be so much better and also no one would steal it.,2
118309,"because if it was outside it could blow away when your driving.
",2
118307,Because the shiny side can reflect heat away from the car.,3
118306,the shine part should face the out side of the car so it can reflect the heat back to the sun.,3
118308,if you have it facing the outside of the car it will reflect and if you had it facing towards the inside of the car it will absorb,3
118321,Because if you towards the car it will attract a lot of solar radiation and if you put it out the car it won't attract no solar radiation ,3
118312,The not so shiny part should be facing the inside because the shiny part is kind of like tin foil so it should be reflecting the solar radiation.,4

118301,I think that laura should have the shiny part facing the inside and not the outside because shiny things attract the sun.,3
118316,it should shine on the out side of the car because it will reflect the sun off it.,4
118320,They would go on the inside of the car because it would be more cool in the car.,2
118294,The sunlight will be reflected before the heat gets inside the car.,4
118315,if Laura were to face the shiny part toward the inside of the car...it would be the perfect solar oven so Laura would have to face the shiny part AWAY from the car so that it doesn't happen ,4
118323,the shiny side should face the outside because it reflects more sun light.,4

118475,So it reflects the light out of the car.,4
118477,I think it should face the outside of the car because if you dont put the shiny part of the shade thingy the sun will just zoom right in into your car cause it doesnt have the shiny part facing outwards. So I suggest facing it outside.,3
118465,"It will reflect the solar radiation away from the car's interior.

118487,then the solar radiation would reflect out of the car,4
118488,It should face this way because if it faces the other way the sun will reflect on it making it hot on the inside ,4
118486,Out of the car because it can reflect the heat and energy getting in the car and the not shiny part won't reflect the heat and energy as much as the shiny part.,4

136380,"The shinny part with reflect the heat off the car. It is kind of like a window, they reflect the heat off because it is shinny. It is also a light color. ",3
136391,"So the Heat and light off the sun goes towards it, will be reflected of it and it would not heat up the car.",2
136379, It would have to face out the car so it can reflect the sun light to keep the car cool.,4
136377,i choose this because the sun could reflect off ,4
136381,I think the shiny part should face outside because it will reflect the sun. I know because some people have the shiny ones and I get blinded.,4
136361,shiny stuff reflects heat and if you have it facing toward the car it will heat the car up.,3
136685,So it can get all of the light.,2
136419,"The sun's will be reflected off of the shiny side, so less heat will enter the car.",4
136415,the shiny cover is going to reflect the suns rays back twords space and the sun or to another car.,4
136395,"If the shiny side is facing the sun,it will help deflect sunlight better because it acts as a mirror. It reflects more heat and absorbs less.",4
136393,"If the shiny side of the shade faces the inside of the car, it will not reflect the sun's rays back out, instead absorbing the rays. ",4
136408,It should face the outside of the car because it'll reflect the UV rays.,3
136421,The shiny side will reflect light.,4
136404,"I think the shiny part should go on the outside because the shiny part is like a window, and windows refect light, so the shiny part will reflect the light.",4
136420,because the shiny part will reflect the light and heat the opposite way from the inside of the car.,4
136414,I chose that because that will reflect the sun light. ,4
136392,Since light can reflect from the shiny part is gonna go the other way and not toward the car.,4
136397,It should face towards the out side of the car because that way they part the shily part is more thicker,2
136424,If it is facing out it will reflect the light and thus keep the car cooler.,4
136423,It should face outside the car so it can deflect the sun's rays away from the car keeping it cool.,4
136403,"It should face toward the inside of the car, because if it was facing outside, then the sun would reflect off of it making the car hot.",2
136412,"you want the shiny part to face out of the car, because it reflects the sun from the windshild and windows back out side and into outer space.",4
136407,The shiny side will reflect back the light and heat away from the car.,4
136411,BECAUSE YOU WANT THE SUN TO HIT THE SHINE PART AND BOUNCE RIGHT OFF AND THAT WILL KEEP THE CAR COLLER.,4
136402,Then the heat won't hit the car at all because the windshield will be blocking the heat.,2
136400,If it shines out it reflects the heat.,3
136406,Well if part of the shiny sun is showing then it needs to beam out side of the car and ficure 2 (the second picture) can reflect the light from the car to the sun ( or someplace else),4
136405,I think this because the light from the shield is shiny witch can make the sun reclect off the shield and back into space or somewear else.,4
136416,so it reflects,2
136409,The shiny part will reflect heat from the inside of the car.  It stops heat from getting through the windshield.,3
136398,"She should face the shiny part of the shade outside because it's like a mirror. This will reflect the sun and the other part is darker, so it might absorb the sun's light.",4
136418,It should face out of the car because that way the light is going away from the car and not into the car and that is what she needs if she wants her car to say cool and not hot ,3
136399,If the shiny part is facing it will heat up the car and the sun shades will be use less ,2
136417,You inside of your car because you do not some thing to catch on fire.,2
136425,It should face out of the car because it will reflect the sunlight and her car won't get hot.,4
136394,The shade should have the shiny side part facing out of the car because it would have light bounce off of of.,4
136422,I think she should put the shade on the inside so the heat can reflect of the shade .,2
136410,I think the metalic side should face out side of the car so it can reflect the light outside of the car.,4
136396,Because if it get inside its gonna make the car hot ,2
136426,The shinny part would make the car hotter.,2
136413,Since it is put towards the outside it would reflect it and wouldn't get inside.,3
136453,Since the shiny side would reflect light Laura should make them face the opposite direction of the car so the car does not absorb the light.,4
136451,If it is facing the sun it will deflect the heat,3
136462,It will be outsiede because the shiny part will get hot but your car will be cool. ,2
136481,"I choose this because when you use this side, the sun light reflects off the foil part and back outside of the car. ",4
136460,The shiny part will reflect the sun making it not as hot as the non-shiny part which the heat can go straight through. The shiny sun shade will make a bigger effect on keeping heat out than the non- shiny. ,4
136457,"The shiny side I think reflects the sunlight. So not much heat would get in. If you use the non-shiny side, it may absorb the heat and sunlight. At least depending on the color of the sun-shade.",4
136459,If she wants the cover to block it she's going to need to face the shiny part away so the sun moves away from it.,2
136476,The shiny part will reflect the light.,4
136456,The shiny part will reflect the sunlight.,4
136483,I choose this because if it is on the inside the inside of the car will block out the sun and be shady.,2
136463,"The shiny part should face the outside of the car so it can reflect the heat, out of the car.",3
136450,The reflective part of the shade will reflect the heat and light back to the world.,4
136482,The shiny sun shade that would go on the window shield should face toward the outside of the car because the shiny side can and will reflect the sun back into the outside. But if the non shiny side would suck up the light and push it into the car.,4
136467,"The shiny part will reflect the sun's radiation better, it will just bouce off.",4
136454,The shinny should be outside so that it can reflect the heat from the outside. ,3
136465,so the brightness can reflect the light. ,4
136477,"I put Toward the inside of the car because if it was the out of the car it could reflect in to the car.
",2
136468,Laura should put it facing the other direction because if she puts in face towards the car the cor wont be nice and cool its going to be burning hot.,2
136461,I think the outside because it is better if the light is absorbed it will not go into the car.,2
136475,You should put it inside the car because the sun does not comes in  the car and it keeps it cooler.,3
141559,so the heat will deflect out and not in the car ,3
136485,Because if you put that in front of the car it prevents the sun to make your car from the inside to not get very warm or hot! Also because when the sun is getting your car very hot but you have the shiny shield on the front of your car it gives the sun a sign of not putting to much warmness inside your car. ,2
136452,I have seen cars use sun shades and it's facing out of the car.,2
136471,because it will keep the heat out of the car,2
136474,It will reflect light.,4
141560,,1
136469,If the shinny part faces in it will not reflect the light to make it less hot.,4
141561,It will block the sun from coming inside because it reflects the sun since its a light.,4
136480,"Why because, the heat is going to reflect back into Laura's car.",2
136464,The reason for this is because since it is shiny that means that it is reflecting heat. And if you pick the other one on the outside it would still keep your car cold but not as much as the shiny one. And that is my reasoning for this question.,3
136455,"The cover is shiny and metallic looking, while the other side is dull and dark. To reflect more light, I would use the shiniest an metallic side to keep hot sun out of the windshields reach",4
136492,I think it should face the outside because the sun radiation would reflect and bounce off the car.,4
136500,I chose this because anything shiny reflects sunlight,4
136494,I chose out of the car because the shiny side will reflect the light and not absorb the light.,4
136495,"if the shiny part faced out, it would he up and make her car warmer, which is why it should face toward the inside.",2
136499,She should face the shiny part outside the car because the sun will bounce off the shiny part back into the sky.,3
136489,"If it faced toward the outside of the car, the suns light (UV light/ultraviolet light) would reflect off the shiny side. The light would then go to a different area. Now that doesn't mean it won't absorb it all up, it will still absorb a small amount of it.",4
136498,The shiny part should face out of the car because the shininess will reflect the suns heat and energy. ,4
136503,Shiny things reflect light.,4
136509,The one side of the sun shade is very shiny on shoud be in the car because shiny things deflct and that will make the windoiw very hot. The other side is not shiny will be on the out side because noshiny things do not deflct.,2
141563,if you put it of the car it wont be hot if you do it will be hot,2
136504,It will go outside of the car because it is still white . My dad has used then and they do reflect of and out because it is like a mirror reflecting light of . That is why I choose this answer .,4
136490,Because it will reflect the sun off the car. Also my family use to have one of those and the shiny part is suppose to face away from the car ,4
136516,The shiny side will reflect sun light/heat away from the car so it will stay cool.,4
136507,The shiny sun shade should face outwards so it can reflect the light off of the car.,4
136515,Towards the outside because it would reflect the light. ,4
136501,"That is because, the shiny side would reflect the heat from the window of the car, instead of letting it through, like the ""not shiny"" side would.",3
136505,"The shiny part would face out of the car, and it would result in the suns light to be reflected, and reflect away from the car.",4
,,1
136491,The shinny side traps heat in the sun shade and does not let heat pass.,2
136511,because then it would reflect the sunlight out of here car and somewhere else.,4
136513,Maybe because its reflecting.,2
136502,Out of the car because the shiny is light so it will reflect the heat.,3
136508,"I chose out of the car because the sun shade when its out side the glass won't get too hot not even a little, but if you put it outside the sun will get the mirrors and the glass too hoeand the car too it won't cover it all.",2
136493,The shiny part would make the heat bounce off away from the car.,3
,,1
136518,"The shiny part should face the outside of the car because the shiny part is supposed to reflect light and heat and a mirrored sun shade will probably be better at reflecting UV, visible, and thermal energy, which means more of that energy is kept outside of her car.  ",4
136512,light reflects and if she wants to keep her car cool than she wants to reflect it off of her car not into it.,4
136506,The shiny part should be facing the sun because it is shiny and it will deflect light back from where it came from.,4
136497,So the light will reflect of the car.,4
136514,"I chose to have the shiny tinfoil looking part of the sun shade to face outside the car because if it is used to keep the sun from making the car hot since it is called a sun shade , I thought that the shiny part of the sun shade is supposed to make it so that the sun will reflect off the tinfoil making it so that the car does not get hot inside while the shiny part of the sun shade reflects the heat and sunlight.",4
136519,The winshield reflects the light going towards the car.,4
136522,"She wants the car not to be hot, so she should have the energy reflected back outward, not inward.",4
136496,refection of heat,3
136517,"This is because the heat will not be able to gt in, and if it is, it gets absorbed into something she won't touch.",2
136520,because it will reflect the light out of the car.,4
136571,The shiny part will reflect all the sun light so it won't get to hot.,4
136550,"If its facing the inside all the light will go into the car, but facing out it'll reflect outside.",4
136557,"On the other side, there is a black side, and if you put that side outwards, it would not absorb heat.",2
136566,the shiny will reflect the sun's heat and the white part will keep it cool.,4
136558,Because the sun will bounce of the shine and go back into space.,4
136555,the shiny part will reflect the sun's heat from the car so the car on get as heated.,2
136563,It will reflect the light a way.,4
136556,I chose out because the sun could bounce off the shiny part.,4
136569,"The shiny part will reflect the suns rays outward, or away.",4
136574,I think that if it is facing out of the car is the best option because it will reflect the light that is trying to get in the car.,4
136565,,1
136561,The shiny part absorbs all the hot stuff and the non-shiny stuff keeps it from passing to the cars inside.,2
136583,I choose this because most shiny things reflect light than other things.,4
136551,If she puts it out of her car it is just going to fall off and you are suppose to keep it there so it doesn't mess up the dash board   ,2
136549,"The shiny part goes on the outside because it absorbs light, and makes the car cooler.",3
136570,The shiny part of the sun shade will reflect the light away from the car. The other side won't really do anything.,4
136560,Because the sunshade reflects the sun coming at her car when turn it out of the car,4
136572,Because the shiny part will absorb the sunlight,2
136559,I chose the shinny part going out of the car so the light would be reflected.,4
136564,I think the shiny part should face outside because it has a higher albedo so it would reflect the heat.,3
136567,the shiny side will reflect and the other will not,3
136553,Because if it's shiny then that mean it is reflecting so it making the light from the sun reflecting off of the part of the car it is over.,4
136546,"The shiny part would reflect the light and/or heat inside the car, thus heating the car up. The less shiny part does not reflect.",2
136580,I think that Laura should put the sun shade on the inside because the sun wouldn't reflect it.,2
136576,"i think this because if she puts the shiny part outward then when the sun hits it , it will reflect the sun thus causing no sun to heat the car.and if she were toput the non shiny part outward it would get hot because there is not something shiny to reflect it of the car.",4
136355,The shiny part should face out of the car because the Sun's light will reflect off of it and bounce back into the atmosphere.,4
136351,You would want it facing out the car so that it would reflect the heat back out of the car.,3
136389,You would want the shiny part of the sun shade to face the outside the car. This will reflect the heat out of the car keeping it cooler. If she put the shiny part towards the inside of the car then it would make the solar radiaton reflect into the car making the car warmer and that is  the opposite of what we want. Making the shiny part facing the outside will make the heat reflect out keeping the car cool.,4
136373,It should face-out of the car because if you had it the other way the heat will come in and make the car warm.And if you put it on the shiny part it will reflect.And it would not hot the inside of the car,3
136377,I think it will refkect and not attract light making it reflect and not have heat inside the car.,4
136366,I always remember that tin foil will always reflect rays. So when picture number two is facing out the suns rays will be reflected and your car wont be super hot.,4
136356,I picked out of the car because the shiny part is kind of like foil. Like foil it will reflect all of the solar radiation and won't turn into heat.So that way if the shiny part is faced out of the car than the suns solar radiation will reflect off of it.,5
136363,Because the shiny part would deflect the Sun away from the inside of the car.,4
136375,Because the shiny part will reflect heat away from the car. ,3
136370,I think this because it looks like foil and it might reflect some heat.,3
136391,I chose b because the shiny part of the windshield will act has a reflecter andreflect the heat light away from the car.,4
136404,"Most shiny things reflect light, so Laura would want to use something to reflrct solar energy- not absorb it.",5
136411,you want the shinny part facing the out side of the car to reflect the heat back out and not make the car so warm ,3
136400,The sun shade would reflect the sun out of the car.,3
136460,The shiny side will reflect the heat out of the car. If Laura were to put the dull side facing out the heat wouldn't be reflect that well if at all. The shiny side will do much better at reflecting heat out and keeping her car cool. ,3
136476,I chose have the shiny part point to the out side of the car because the shiny stuff will reflect the sun and send the suns raise back into the air.,4
136462,It will be inside because the sun rays will reflict the shiny shade. That will not let the inside of the car hot but the outside window is hot. ,4
136504,I think that she should choose the windshield because it will reflect it is just like the tin foil . SO it will not make it hotter then the inside .,3
136500,I chose this because the shiny part reflects the sunlight. ,4
136490,My dad had on and he would put it on the inside of the window facing out. It reflects the light from the sun to the and back up in space.,4
136505,"The part of the windshield that is shiny should be facing outside, becuas ethat way, the light would be reflected of the car, and not be absorbed into it.",5
136509,Because shiny things reflet heat and not shiny things don't reflct light.,4
136519,You should put them that way so all the sun will reflect outwards so most of sun dose not go in.,3
136495,"It should face the outside because it will reflect light. When it reflects light, it will make it less hot in the car, because no sunlight is getting inside.",4
136550,"If it is facing outside it will reflect the light outside, if you do it facing the car it will reflect it into the car.",4
136572,Out of the car because the shiny part will reflect the light just like our tin foil in our solar oven.,4
136557,"On the other side, there is a black side, and if you put that side outwards, it would absorb heat, but not reflect it.",4
136563,This will also  reflect the heat away.,3
136518,"I think that she should choose the windshield toward the out of the car because it will reflect it is just like the tin foil, and so it will not make it hotter than the inside. The shiny part should face the outside of the car because the shiny part is supposed to reflect light and heat and a mirrored sun shade will probably be better at reflecting UV, visible, and thermal energy, which means more of that energy and heat is kept outside of her car.  ",4
136381,"The shiny part should face the out of the car because it will reflect the heat, and blocking the heat, so the inside of the car won't be hot.",3
136359,Toward the inside because the sun will reflect inside the car and all that heat will be trapped inside of the car because the heat has no way to escape.,2
136372,"She should aim the sun shade facing out of the car, because if it was facing the inside of the car, the heat would reflect into the car.",3
136382,"It shod face out of the car because, it will reflect all the heat away since it has a high albedo. The heat would be reflected inside if it was the other way.",3
136683,because if it was the out siyed it would contrack the heat ,2
136390,The shinny part should face outside of the car because the shinny part reflects the light and heat. Causing the heat to leave and can't come in the car.  ,4
136388,The shiny part will reflect the sun because if you compare it to a solar oven an aluminum flap is like the sun shade. We tried to make our oven hot by facing the shiniest part on the inside. She wants the opposite so she has to have it facing outward.,5
136362,It should face inside because the most reflective part is the shiny part. If it faces the outside the sun will reflect off before it even gets in the car. The non shiny part would make it just go into the car and then it would be trapped din there and be hot. ,4
136374,So when the light beams onto the car it will reflect the majority of the light.,4
136380,The shiny part will reflect the heat so the car won't get really hot.,3
136378,It would reflect the hot air off the car so no heat gets in.,3
136367,"out of the car because the suns heat wot enter the car as much if you put on the out side, but if you put it on the inside the suns heat will be absorbed by the glass and causing heat in the car.",2
136352,The shiny side can also help more light be reflected out of the car.,4
136360,so it can reflect the heat,3
136379,It needs to reflect to keep the car cool inside.,3
6971,because if the windshield is out of the car the sun could still reflected when its on the inside of the car it is covering the glass so it could not reflected in.,4
136368,i think it should face outside of the car so the heat will reflect off the sun shade so the heat won't stay inside of the car.,3
136364,The shiny part of the  sun shade is reflecting more light because it is shiny and the shiny psrts reflect more light.,4
136384,She should put the shiny part of the sunshade towards the outside of the car. This is because the shiny part will reflect the heat whereas if it is facing the inside of the car it will do nothing.,3
136393,"If the sunshade is shiny, the more light will be reflected away, reducing the amount of heat going into the car. ",4
136413,You want to make sure the heat is reflected away from the car and it does not get trapped inside.,3
136394,"I would have the the shiny part face out of the car because it would attract less heat and have it bounce off,",2
136405,I would put these on the outside of the car because it would reflect the sun and not make the car hot. If you these on the inside of the car the heat would have already got into the car and the car would be hotter.,4
136423,the shiny part would reflect the sun's radiation off the car.,4
136398,This will reflect the light just like tin-foil. It will not attract the heat into the car.,4
136414,"If the shiny part is facing out of the car, it will reflect the sun. ",4
136408,She should make the shiny side of sun shade face outwards so that it reflects the light away from the car.,4
136420,The shiny side should go outward because it will reflect the heat back of the window not letting the heat come through the windshield keeping the car cooler.,3
136419,The shiny side will reflect light and heat away from the car.,4
136424,If it is facing away from the car it will reflect more light away keeping it cold,4
136392,The shiny part acts like tin foil or aluminum foil and that will reflect off most of the light away from the car.,4
136426,because it will reflect all of the heat out of the car.,3
136685,Having towards the out side will reflect the most light.,4
136403,"The shiny side of the sun shade should face toward the inside of the car, because if the shiny part of the shade was facing outside it would reflect the suns heat onto the car and it would make the car become hotter.",2
136422,I think toward the inside of the car because you could put in the car on the windshield so the sun will reflect off the shiny side.,4
136416,so it reflects out her window instead of off the window so creating less heat for the car to take,3
136425,It should face outside of the car so it reflects the heat. If it were to face inside it would still be hot.,3
136395,"If the shiny part faces outward, the heat that hits it will reflect back out instead of getting absorbed into the car. The shiny part will reflect heat better.",4
136474,The shiny surface will reflect the light away.,4
136467,I chose out of the car because the sunlight would bounce off the shiny side preventing it from getting inside the car so there would be less heat.,4
136463,"The shiny part should face the outside, so it can reflect the heat back out.",3
136483,I think that is the answer because you want the heat to go out of the car so it wont be hot inside.,2
136461,The light would be being absorbed into the shades of the car and not being absorbed into the inside of the car.,3
136465,It should face the outside of the car so the heat can be reflected. ,3
136459,You would want the sun to reflect off of the car so it wouldn't focus on any other part of the car so your car wouldn't get as hot.,4
136485,It should face toward the inside of the car because it can prevent the sun from reflecting it inside the car and instead of bouncing it back to space and giving it a signal to the sun of letting it go inside the car and making it hotter .,4
136455,"Kind of like answer #2, the light will reflect off of the car when it has a lighter accent to work with, it would more likely have a better chance of keeping Laura's car cooler out in the sun all day.",4
136453,I chose out of the car because the sunlight would bounce of the sunlight decreasing the temperature.,4
136477,I think it will be Toward the inside of the car because that will make it stay cool.,2
136517,"I think this because the shiny part will reflect and stop all the heat from getting in, and the dull side will stop all the heat inside from being absorbed by absorbing the heat itself, which is fine because it won be touched when she uses the car again.",3
136496,the shiny part of the visor will reflect the heated sunlight,4
136489,"The light should reflect off of the shiny side, going back out to the outside.",4
136511,because the shiny part of the sun shade is going to reflect the suns heat so that the air inside of the car.,2
136499,The shiny part should face the outside because it will reflect more sun that way.,4
136506,"She should put the shiny part towards the car because the dull side will absorb the heat, so the car will stay cooler.",3
136497,Outside the car because the shinny side will reflect the light.,4
136508,I chose out of the car because the light will be reflected by the sun shade.,4
141563,if you put it inside it wont get hot in the sun but if you put it outside it will get hot cause it is atraceing the light.,2
136501,"This is because the ""shiny"" part will reflect the heat, so it will not go in the car. If the shiny part faced inside of the car, the heat would be drawn in, and would have trouble leaving.",3
136493,The shiny part should face outwards because that would reflect heat making the car cooler.,3
136512,The outside part is shiny so it would reflect unlike the duller part would not reflect.,3
136503,This way the shades reflect the light to the outside of the car.,4
136498,The shiny part would face out of the car because it will reflect the heat that comes toward to make it hotter. ,3
136520,the reflection of light is guided away from the inside of the car.,4
136494,I chose for the shiny part to face out of the car because the shinier part would reflect the light more then the not so shiny part.,4
136514,I chose to put the very shiny side pointing out toward the outside of the car because the shiny part of the sunshade is like tinfoil and tinfoil reflects the sunlight and heat. So if the shiny part of the sunshade is pointing out toward the car then there is a better chance the car will stay cooler because the shiny part of the sunshade is helping reflect the heat and sunlight leaving the car cooler.,4
136522,"Laura does not want her car to be hot, so she wants the hot solar radiation to be directed outside of her car, not inward.",4
136558,So the heat can bounce of back into the atmosphere.,3
136567,it will reflect most of the heat .,3
136555,The shinny part will reflect the heat from the car so heat can't come in the car.,3
136571,The shing stuff will reflect the light like a mirior,4
136551,"Inside, because it is the only logical thing to do because someone can steal it or the wind will blow it off",2
136566,The heat outside will be reflected by the shiny part back outside.,3
136549,"The shiny part should face the outside of the car, so when the light hits it and reflects it doesn't go in the car but reflects out of the car. I know this because when sunlight hits tin foil it gets hot, and the shiny thing is like tin foil, and also I took the sun visor out of the wind shield it was super hot.  ",4
136355,"The shiny part of the sun shade should be facing the outside of the car because then the heat will most likely reflect.  If the shiny part is toward the inside of the car, it won't help keep the car cool.",3
136492,Because the sunlight will reflect off the shade it will be bounced off the shad and back into the world.,4
136361,If you face the shinny part out side it is like tinfoil so it will reflect the heat away.,3
136354,It should be towards the out side because it will reflect more.,3
136387,It should face to the outside so that the reflective side can reflect the rays from the sun.,4
136369,if it's faced towards the outside of the shiny part would show making it reflect heat.,3
136351,You would want it facing away from your car so the heat stay on instead of coming in.,2
136421,The shiny side will also reflect light.,4
136397,"It should face towards the outside of the car, because the shiny part will reflect the heat.",3
136412,It should face to the outside of the car because then the shiny part will reflect the heat out of the car.,3
136399,the shinny side is not going to let the heat inside ,2
136402,"You put it on the outside so the no heat will go in the car at all, the sun shades reflect light/heat.",4
136396,It should be toward because be cause if its out the car the heat wont keep out of the car.,2
136407,Shiny stuff will reflect light and heat away from the car if put on the outside.,4
136406,"Sence the shiny part of the windshield is shiny it should face the outside of the car because her goal is trying to keep the car cooled down and be cool so thats why I pick ""Out of the car"".",2
136417,You want it toward the inside of the car not the out because if put the outside it will catch on fire because of the brightness of it but if you put the one that is not shiny then it won't catch on fire.,2
136410,so it will reflect the light.,4
136409,The shiny part will reflect the heat and stop it from going into the car.,3
136450,The shiny part will reflect the heat so it doesn't absorb it.,4
136451,That way the shiny part ca reflect the solar energy. Keeping the air inside the car cool.,4
136468,The outside of the car because on the shinny part of the windshield car reflect the suns sun rays towards the sky.,4
136480,So the shiny part will block the sunlight from coming in. The shiny part will absorb the heat and reflect right back out the car so no other heat does not come in.,4
136482,The very shiny side is a reflector and it is suppose to let the solar radiation bounce off of the reflector and not get hot.,4
136457,"If the shiny part were to face out, the sun would hit it and would bounce off to somewhere else. If you used the kind of dull side, it may just absorb the light.

But then again, it looks like most sun-shades I have are all dull-sided. Either that or I don't pay attention to it.",5
136456,The shiny part of the sun shade will reflect more light because it has higher albedo. ,4
136454,"The shinny part which is something like aluminum foil ,would face the outside of the car to help prevent and reflect heat from coming in to the car.",3
141561,If you have the shiny part outside it will reflect because the other said is not light colored and then you have less heat because it is reflecting the heat out.,3
136475,Laura should put the windshield toward the inside of the car because the window will hold the heat outside.,2
141559,well sinse the shiny part is way more reflective you should put it on the out side not the inside because if you put it on the out side it reflects all the heat out side now if you were to put it on the inside all the heat from the inside will try to escape but it cant because of the reflectivity.,3
136481,"The shiny part is like a mirror, it reflects away from the car. That is why the shiny part should be on the outside.",3
136469,Out of the car because it will reflrect the heat and not absobe the heat so it will not be hot in the car.,4
136507,The shiny part of the sun shade should face outward to reflect sunlight off of the car and prevent heat from making it's way through the windshield.,4
136502,Because since its shiny it reflects heat off of it.,3
136515,The side that is shiny should face the inside because it will help get heat in. ,2
136553,Because when it is shiny then that mean it is reflecting.,3
136583,The shiny side should face outward because the reflectiveness of the shield will deflect most of the heat.,3
136546,The shiny part of the sun shade attracts heat and would bounce the heat inside the car if it was facing in,2
136574,If it faces out of the car that means that s sending back the rays into the sky.,3
136570,She would want to face the shiny side out of the car because when the solar and UV rays shine onto it then they would just get reflected back. If you face the non-shiny side of the sun shade the the rays will most likely get absorbed.,5
136569,"Solar radiation would be reflected by the shinier side of the sun shade, therefore keeping it cooler.",4
136580,The shiny part of the shade should face the inside of the car because the sun would radiate more to the shiny part.,2

136561,The shiny part absorbs the sun's rays and then bounces them back to space.,4
136576,i say that lauren should put the shiny part facing outward of the car because if it's really shiny it will reflect all the sun of and out of her car because one it doesn't have a dark color or a light color so it doesn't attract or reflect and detrack it will just reflect off of it so the car won't get hot.,2
136556,I said out of the car because the sun's light rays will bounce off of it. ,4
136560,Because it can reflect the sun from the car.,4
139536,The light would be reflected away from the car which reflects the heat.,4
139541,The shiny part will reflect light from the sun. Therefore less heat will be absorbed.,5
139545,Out of the car because it will reflect the heat radiation back outside instead of being inside.,4

139864,The shiny part could reflect the sunlight.,4
139863,"Using the shiny part pointing away from the car, the heat can be reflected off of the car and pointed toward another direction. ",3
139495,Because the shiny part of the sun shade will reflect light away from the car and it will not trap heat in the car.,4
139494,The shiny part should face out of the car because its shiny and reflective surface will help the sun ray bounce off/ be reflected back so that the car can keep cool.,4
139492,The shiny side should face out of the car because it will reflect the sunlight.,4
139824,The shiny part should face outside the car to reflect the sunlight so it wouldn't go into the car and heat up the car.,4
139482,"This way, she can maximize the amount of sunlight she reflects. The not so shiny side would not be as effective as the shiny side.",4
139493,"The shiny part will reflect the sunlight, which means it will not allow the sunlight to enter into her car, keeping the temperature of her car cool.",4
139483,The shiny part should be facing out the car because that means the radiation from the sun is being reflected back to the atmosphere // not in her car and that is a good thing for laura because that means less radiation is penetrating her car to heat it up. ,4
139834,"This means it has reflective tendencies, and reflecting sunlight will not heat up your car.",4
139515,The shiny part should face out of the car because the shiny part of the sun shade is more efficient at reflecting radiation than the not shiny side.,4
139831,The shiny part should face the outside of the car because it can easily deflect the light more than the dull side. ,4
139525,The shiny side should face the outside because it will reflect the sun's rays instead of absorbing them.,5
139514,"The shiny side would reflect more light energy than just the light-dull side. So if the shiny part is reflecting more of the energy, the car would be cooler.",4
139520,"If you have the shiny part face out of the car, then the light shining towards the sun shade will reflect the light rather than take in the light which will take in the heat into the sun shade.",4
139518,The shiny side should face the outside because the shiny sides acts as a mirror.  The sun's rays will be reflected and away from the car's interior.,4
139527,The shiny part reflects light so that the car doesn't heat up.,4
139506,It should face to the outside because these shiny particles help reflect the light.,4
139832,The shiny side points to the outside of the car because it helps to reflect the light and not absorb as much heat.,5
139833,The shiny material will be able to help reflect sunlight and keep the waves from getting inside and heating up the car. ,4
139505,"The shiny part of the sun shade is shiny because it reflects more of the sun's light, therefore it should be facing outside of the car to reflect more of the radiation coming from the sun to heat up the car.",4
139508,"The shiny part is usually made of aluminum or some type of other metal since it is shiny, with the metallic-looking lust. Metals are good conductors of heat, but because the other side is not shiny, it is harder to conduct heat on that side, so the rate of heat flow through conduction will be slower. If the shiny part was on the inside, the heat absorbed by the not shiny side will transfer fairly quickly to the shiny side and will then transfer onto the car because of the metal's faster rate of heat flow. ",2
139507,I think the shiny side to face out of the car since it is the reflective side. Shiny objects like jewelry or even the screen of a smartphone are reflective of light which is why they are shiny in the first place. So I believe that the shiny side will reflect the light from the sun.,4
139836,The shiny side should face out of the car because shiny things are used to reflect light. reflecting light will reduce the heat.,4
139526,The shiny part of the shade should face the out of the car because this will reflect the sun rays away from the car so that it won't heat up.,4
139528,The shiny side will have a better chance of reflecting heat away from the car.,3

139517,The shiny part will reflect the sun light if the sun shade is facing towards the sun.,4
139861,The shiny part will be more reflective compared to the dull side,3
140326,Usually I see cars put the shiny part on the outside of the car but it doesn't make sense to me because i think it would attract heat more. ,2
139543,This is because shiny material reflects more then non shiny ones. If you have less sunlight then it would be safe to assume that you do not get as much heat also.,4
139865,The shiny side of the sun shade reflects light back out into the atmosphere.,4
139538,The shiny part will absorb a lot of the heat that is directed into the car and I see people do this a lot.,2
139533,The shiny part is used to reflect the rays of the sun so that the rays don't go inside of the car and make it hot. ,4
139539,The Solar Radiation will reflect off of the the shades so that less heat travels inside the car making the inside of the car more cooler.,4
139537,The shiny part of the sun shade is the part that reflects light the most due to its reflective surface the solar radiation from the sun will bounce off preventing any solar radiation from converting to heat.,5
139862,"The reflective part would reflect more radiation away from the inside of the car, blocking more of the sun's light from reaching inside the car.",4
139535,The shiny side of the sun shade is reflective and will reflect light waves from the Sun and direct them out of her car. ,4
139534,The shiny part should face out of the car because this will help cool down the car by reflecting the light wavelengths coming from the sun and absorbing less.,5
139487,The shiny part should be faced out of the car because it can reflect the sunlight away from the car.,4
139826,The mirrored shiny side will reflect the sun and prevent the absorption of heat. The other side would most definitely absorb heat.,5
139481,The shiny part of the sun shade should be facing the outside so it can negate the sun rays coming from space instead of getting trapped in your car.,3
139485,The shiny part of the sun shade is coated with the antireflection coating which allows the rays of the sun to get reflected instead of allowing it to absorb the radiation of the sun if it was the not shiny side towards the outside of the car.,5
139497,The shiny side of the sun shade will reflect the sun rays that would normally go through her windshield causing for a cooler car since the sun rays are being reflected instead of being absorbed.,5
139479,A shiny coating would mean that that side of the sun shade is more reflective. Reflecting more energy coming from the sun would keep the car cooler.,4
139480,Putting a reflective material out of the car will allow for the material to reflect the sun's radiation and to keep the car cool. ,4
139496,The shiny part of the sun shade works almost like a mirror. It will reflect the sunlight away from the car by the law of reflection.,4
139488,I chose outside of the car so that maybe the shiny part of the sun shade can reflect some heat rays coming from the sun.,2

139486,"The shiny part will reflect the sun light back into the atmosphere not allowing any heat into the car, which will allow the car to feel cooler than warmer. If you used the none reflective side than the car will just begin to heat up since nothing is being reflected rather being absorbed.",5
139830,To reflect the sunlight to go outside of the car and not inside.,4
139501,The shiny side would face out of the car because the brighter side would reflect the sun back and not into the car which would cause the car to heat up a lot more and faster. ,4
139829,The shiny part reflects light and that is a reason why many people use the shiny part to tan. For the car the shiny part should be facing outside so the sun could be reflected off the car.,4
139489,The shiny side will have a greater reflect than the not so shiny side. Since the shiny side reflects more it should reflect more sunlight and causing less sunlight to enter her car.,4
139490,The shiny part of the sun shade should be facing the outside because this way the light is reflected back towards the atmosphere. ,4
139491,The shiny part face should be facing outside of the car because we want that shinny part to reflect as much sun light as possibly back into the atmosphere. ,4
139478,"That way the radiation from the sun will reflect outside the car instead of inside, allowing the care to be cooler because the shiny side is reflective, deflecting the rays toward the outside. ",4
139827,the shiny part will help reflect the sun rays that are shining on the car back out instead of into the car,4

139523,The shiny part face outside the car because it can reflect the suns rays so that the inside of the car do not get hot.,4
139524,The shiny material can reflect the light more than a not shiny surface can; it is more similar to a mirror. ,4
139519,"The very shiny side is reflective, so the sunlight just bounces off of it back up into the air. When I look at shiny things, my eyes hurt because the light is bouncing off of it hitting my eyes, so I would assume that is what is happening with the sun shade.",4
139522,The shiny part should face outside because it will reflect the sunlight.,4
139516,The shiny part is used to reflect the sun light so the car won't get as hot.,4
139511,"If the shiny part faces inside the car, the inside temperature will increase because the glare will reflect off the mirrors and windows inside the car, possibly increasing the temperature of the car or start a fire. I do not really use windshield covers. ",2
139536,The shiny part of the sun shade will reflect the light to go back out of the car. This will also allow less radiation to be inside of the car which will have less heat.,4
139541,Facing the shiny side out of the car will reflect radiation. More radiation is reflected using the shiny part vs the not shiny part. ,4
139497,The shiny part of the sunshade will reflect the light that would otherwise be absorbed into the car.,5

139826,"The shiny material reflects the sun's rays as it is a reflective material. The reflective material does not absorb the sun's radiation and will not absorb heat. If the material were on the other side it would probably retain the infrared radiation inside the car, making it warmer.",5
139493,"the shiny part will reflect the sunlight off, and then the dark part will absorb whatever excess heat that goes through the shiny shade part.",5
139513,The Sunlight will be reflected off the sun shade in the windshield and back outside.,4
139834,"Shiny means reflective, and reflecting solar radiation means less heat and less temperature rise.",4
139831,"The shiny part should face the outside of the car because it better reflects heat than the non-shiny side, keeping the car cool. ",3

139545,Having it reflect out of the car will redirect the sun toward a different direction.,4
139538,The shiny part is a good reflector for the infrared rays from the sun so having it face outside against the sun will reflect a good amount of the heat back outside.,4
139533,The shiny side aids in reflecting away the sun rays. The non shiny side will absorb the heat if it is faced towards the outside of the car. ,5
140326,the shiny part will reflect the hot outside so it will keep the car cool.,3

139643,The shiny part should face out of the car because it will reflect the light and heat that is being radiated into the car. ,4
139802,The shiny part should out of the car.,2
139842,Because the rays of the sun goes through the car and it need a shield inside instead of the outside ,3
139845,because it will cause the heat transfer slower.,2
139846,The sun shade should be toward the inside of the car because the heat will try to go inside the air of the car but will have a barrier behind the windshield.,2
139561,So that the heat that is absorbed thru the shiny side will be trapped in the sheet by the non-shiny side instead of radiating into the car.,2
139798,"this way, the sun's heat will bounce off the car.",2
139870,The shiny part of the sun shade reflects the suns rays which means it reflects the suns heat.,2
139838,The shiny part should be facing out the car because the sun's rays will reflect off of the shiny part.,4
140093,as there is more shine it'll reflect the sunlight,4
139840,Out because it should reflect the sun so that light can bounce back.,4
139875,The shiny part will make the sun reflect off it instead of it going straight through on the other side. ,4
139806,I think the sunny side will reflect the sunlight more effectively.,4
139856,Shiny part blocks the sun.,3
139841,The reflective material would keep the sun light away so your car would not heat up on the inside.,3
139822,It makes the light reflect so therefore it is not absorbed.,5
139737,So the car inside will not feel hot,2
139853,The shiny side will reflect the heat from the sun back so it doesn't absorb it.,2
139775,The shiny part will reflect the sun better than the other side. ,4
139851,,1
139847,,1
139747,The shiny objects helps the rays of the sun bounce back to space or atmosphere.,4
139843,,1
139739,"If the reflecting part is facing away from the windsheild, then the rays or beams of light from the sun are reflected away.",4
139848,,1
139849,if the shiny part faces the inside of the car then it will heat up the car faster,2
139879,So it can reflect the rays back instead of trap them in the car.,4
139876,"The sun shade should face out of the car, so that the heat would bounce back.",2
139877,The shiny part of the the sun shade would reflect the sun rays away from the car.,4
139881,,1
139869,"It'd be outside the car, because if you're driving, the shiny part would hurt your eyes if its in the inside of your car.",2
139874,"Using the shiny side it will bounce of heat, making the car cooler",2
139867,the shiny side would retract the sun off of the car which would make the car cooler.,3
139873,It would reflect the sunlight from the car.,4
139839,The shinyness can reflect the heat away.,3
139882,The shiny part absorbs more heat so it should be facing the outside. The point of the sun shade is to block the heat from going inside the car that's why!,2
139768,the sun will bounce off the shine and keep it out the car,4
139880,,1
139878,,1
139854,,1
139809,the shiny surface would reflect all the light,4
139814,The shiny part should face out of the car so the sun rays reflect away from the car.,4
139795,,1
139816,,1
139812,It should be outside of the car because its more reflected which will block heat from coming inside.,3
139782,It is out of the car because sun can reflect out of it. ,3
140712,Instead of absorbing the heat it will bounce right off. ,4
139529,because if the sun shine on the shiny thing it will reflect of and it will not make the car warm it will make it cooler,4
139801,It would reflect the radiation probably from the sun and not letting that much heat to get in.,4
139774,I would put it in the outside of the car because it wont hit the sun to you a lot and wont give you cancer.,2
139790,"the shiny part bounces off more colors, which means that it bounces off more heat.",3
139855,Toward the inside of the car because the sunlight will reflects on her,4
139778,,1
139808,,1
139797,,1
139815,"It should face outside, so that it can reflect the radiation from the sun. ",4
139817,the shinny part is like a reflector and instead of taking in the sun's heat it reflects it off so it doesn't take in or give off any heat.,2
139787,It should face the the outside of the car cause it can reflect the suns heat from getting in the car,2
139799,I say out of the car so that the light will not reflect inside of the air therefore making the car;s temp. rise.,4
139785,"With the shiny part facing outwards, solar radiation will be reflected away from the car which will keep a majority of heat away from entering the car.",4
139845,it reflect the heat,3
140093,The shiny part should be facing outside because the shiny part is used to reflect the sun so that it would keep the car cooler than it would be if you didn't use it.,4
139808,I think the skinny part should go on the inside and the thick side should go on the outside of the car window. Too have the thick part twords the sun ,2
139816,The reflectors will reflect the suns rays away from the car this will help keep the car cool.,4
139819,"Letting the sun shade reflect the light will make sure that heat won't be absorbed, but reflected.",5
139782,Toward the outside of the car because it can reflect from the windshield instead of going straight into the inside of the car.,3
139787,the  outside because the shiny part reflects the sunlight back into the world.,4
139769,The reflective side will reflect the light away from the car.,4
139809,The shiny surface will reflect light away from the car and keep the light from being absorbed,5
139556,The shiny side should face the outside so the sun can bounce off of it and not heat the car up.,4
139812,the shiny side should face the outside of the sun bounce off of it and not heat the car up,4
139529,it should face out because the sun reflected on it and doesn't absorb the heat.,5
139815,"Towards the outside, so that it can reflect the suns radiation.",4
139817,the shinny part is a reflector so it makes the sun reflected back,4
139806,because it could reflect the sunlights.,4
139561,The shiny side will reflect the heat instead of absorbing it.,4
139841,This would reflect more light out the car keeping the inside cool,4
139775,The shiny side should face out of the car because the shiny side reflects so the heat can go out of the car instead of in.,3
139844,The shiny part should face the outside of the car because it will reflect the light. ,4
139856,The shiny part should face the outside of the car so that the sun can reflect the sun.,4
139840,so that when the light hits the shield it will reflect back,4
139875,The shiny part will be able to deflect when the sun is hitting the car.,4
139839,The shinyness will reflect the energy away from the car. ,4
139768,the shiny part reflects the sunlight so the car can stay cool,4
139855,The shiny part should face out of the car because it will prevent the sun from being directed towards Laura and it provides like a normal shade.,2
139778,The shiny part reflects the sun light the most,4
139811,You need it to reflect towards the outside of the car because you  dont want to trap the heat inside of the car,3
139801,It would reflect the radiation probably from the sun and not letting that much heat to get in.,4
139803,It should reflect away from the car because you want to reflect the sunlight away from the car so it doesn't come in the car.,4
139813,The shiny part should be facing outwards so the sun reflects off of the shiny part.,4
139790,To bounce back the light because the shiny part is reflective to light.,4
139797,It would reflect the radiation probably from the sun and not letting that much heat to get in. ,4
139814,The shiny part should point outside of the car so the heat rays reflect back out.,4
139810,,1
139795,The sun shade on her windshield should face the shiny one so it reflects the sun.,4
139796,You do not want the sunlight to reflect in he car because you are trying to keep the car cool.,4
139798,It should face out of the car so the sun reflects the sun shade.,4
139842,Because the sun will goes through the car then the shield will go out faster ,2
139818,so it could reflect light out of car keeping inside cooler,4
139643,The shiny part will reflect the sunlight when facing outward thus reducing heat inside the car.,4
139850,the shiny side will reflect heat and light back causing it not to heat up,4
139802,The shiny part should face the outside because it will keep the heat out,2
139843,So the heat can go towards the outide instead of the inside.,2
139849,to reflect the sun out,4
139870,You will want the shiny part of the shade facing the sun because the shiny more reflective part will reflect the heat way from the car keeping the interior cool.,4
139881,You want the shiny side to face out of the car so it will reflect the heat that is going inside the car.,3
139876,The shiny part of the shade should face the outside of the car because it will reflect the sun's rays.,4
139878,The shiny part should face outside so it can prevent the heat going inside the car.,2
139838,"The shiny part should be facing out of the car so that the sun's light could be reflected, keeping the interior cooler.",4
139880,out of the car because it will avoid the sun rays to come inside the car.,3
139871,The shiny part of the sun shade should face on the outside of the car so the heat reflects and bounces out the car instead of towards the car.,3
139882,I think it should face out of the car because then the heat will bounce off instead of going inside of the car.,2
139869,So it keeps cooler and warmer.,2
139847,If it is more shiny it means more light is being reflected and light is the primary heater of the air within the car.,4
139879,,1
139853,The shiny part is outside because it reflects the light. ,4
139747,Out of the car because it prevent heat radiation to come inside the car; it would act as first layer of protection.,3
139774,It should face out of the car because it prevents the sun from her,3
153977,It should shade the outside of the car because then the shiny one would reflect the sun rays better than the not shiny one because then the fabric would not reflect the rays.,4
153978,The shiny side will reflect the sun away.,4
153979,Because it is shine so the sun will reflect of the shine,4
153980,Because the shiny side acts like a solar panel and attracts the heat.,2
153981,"The reflective surface allows sun rays to bounce off of it, which results in no heat inside the enclosed area.",4
153982,With shinny things the heat goes on it and then bounces off Just like the solar oven.,3
153983,out of the car because that type of shiny material makes the heat bounce right off of it.,3
153984,it should be facing toward the car because like a dark shirt or cloths it will take in heat from the sun,2
153985,"Out of the car because, it can reflect the suns rays away from the car.",4
153987,bc less heat will come in the car,2
153989,I think this because the not so skinny side would block the sun's rays better than the skinny side.,3
153991,It acts like an emergency blanket the shiny part reflects it to keep you warm but in this case it reflects it to keep the sun out with the heat.,4
153992,Cause it will make the thing hot.,2
153993,Because the shiny part bounces of the sun.,4
153994,"Shiny things get hot quite quickely. If you look at a shiny thing in the sun, it is very bright. It is attrackting sun and heating it up. Thats why you should put the shiny part facing the inside of the car.",2
153996,Towards the inside because the shinny it will cover more.,2
153997,you should put it on the outside of your car because if you do not the will want to go towards it,2
153999,the shiny part keeps the heat so your car does not get hot,2
154000,so sun can't get in as well.,3
154026,"You want the shiny part to face outside, because the heat goes to the shiny part so the heat goes to the shiny part and nowhere else in her car.",2
154107,I choose the inside of the car because if you if you put it on the outside of the car you not protecting the sun from the car. But when you put it inside the car you are reflecting it from the car  sol the car wont get as hot.,4
154108,"I chose that the shiny part should face the outside of the car because when the sun rays hit the sun shade, the shine will reflect the rays back.",4
154109,The shiny side should be facing the outside because it will reflect the sun.,4
154111,"I think this because when the light shines in the car the shield will reflect the light just a piece of glass, it will keep the heat the heat away.",4
154113,"Because the sun will reflect off of the mirror"" and go somewhere else""",4
154114,I think that it should face out because the shiny part can reflect the sun back.,4
154115,Toward the outside because then the heat is reflected out wards.,3
154117,I chose inside the car because when i see cars I normally see  people with the non shiny part on the out side it might be because it bounces off of it or some other reason. The shiny part would let the sun stay on the shiny part.,4
154121,if you put those wind shields inside the car it will block the sun from the inside of the car.,3
154123,because sun ray travel throw the glass so inside will not let it in and if she put it outside it might fly away.,3
154126,Because the shiny surface will hit the sunlight right back where it came from,4
154129,It is reflecting the sun's rays back to the sky.,4
154131,I think that Laura should have the shiny side facing out because the shiny part is like a mirror so the heat waves will reflect out.,3
154133,why these fabrics should be in the outside  because it is better so that different kind of fabrics should be covering the car from the outside so that it will help the car not get heated up,2
154136,i think that the one on the right will make her car cool,2
154137,"Laura's sun shade that is on her windshield , it would go inside because the sun shade is covering the inside so the sun wouldn't beam inside the car.",3
154138,Because then the heat or air can reflect back and not get stuck i the car so thats why she has to keep it faced out of the car and then it will kind of stay cold :),3
154139,Ichose inside the car because if it was out side it would not work because the fabric on the outside would just absorb the heat and the car  would be hot and the fabric wont save it from getting hot.,3
154142,toward the out side of the car because then it won't make heat,2
154149,it should be facing out side so it can deflect the sun light out wards away from the car.,4
154154,It is better to use shades for cars in the inside because the sun is in the outside of the car and you will need to put the car shades.,3
154302,it should face the outside of the car  because it will keep the heat out,2
154304,i think this because the shiny side will reflect the sun,4
154306,This is an educated guess but I think that the shinier side will reflect more heat than the duller side.,3
154308,The reflection should face outside because the light/heat will reflect outward,4
154312,every thing reflecs back from something shiny.,3
154313,I think this because the non-shiny part would suck up heat.,2
154314,"It wouldn't really matter if the shade was shining sun to the inside but the windows from the side can bring light in depending on what angle Laura's car is parked in, and with that being said, the interior of the car would be all shiny because of the shade. So I recommend to leave it facing outside of the car.",3
154315,The shinier it is I think the less hot it will be.,2
154316,It should face out of the car because the shiny side would deflect the Suns rays.,4
154317,It should face outer for the sun would hit the shiny side and hit back.,3
154320,"because sun is almost repelled from shiny colors unlike light colors, which kind of attract sun more than shiny parts, also my mom got one of those and the box said to face the shiny part towards the sun and not the white/gray/beige color.",3
154328,The shiny one looks like a window sized windshield.,2
154331,She should face out of the car because the sun will reflect off the shinny part of the sun reflect because it is like a mirror.,4
154333,So the heat reflects away from the car.,3
154334,you put the reflected side on the out side  becouse the sun would heat the car up hot,3
154339,because that way it will protect it from the sun.,3
154340,i never sine it out side of a car,2
154341,i said that because if you put it outside of the widow someone will steal it .,2
154344,I think this because the shiny part gets in heat and it could make the inside of the car hot.,2
154346,I luck this ever time,1
154846,It should face the inside of the car because the shininess might attract the Sun and heat.,3
154847,The shiny part should face outward because it is like foil and deflects the sunlight as well as it's heat.,4
154915,,1
153978,The purpose of the shiny side is to reflect heat so it should face outward. Just like the tin foil on our ovens.,4
153979,so it will reflect of.,3
153982,I would put them in the outside because the heat will bounce off of the silver one.,3
154914,It should face out of the car because it will reflect the light and solar radiation away from the car.,4
153991,Reflective objects should face the sun to reflect the heat.,4
154107,Toward the inside of the car because the big window is attracts the most heat so that's why it should be in the inside of the car.,2
154126,I choose the out of the car because the light will reflect off the Aluminum and it will not go inside the car.,4
154111,It will reflect the heat,3
154108,The shiny side should face the outside of the car because it will reflect the sunlight out of the car instead of letting the other side absorb the sunlight.,5
154133,Why because its better if they are in the inside of the car because so that it will be blocking the sun.,3
154113,the shiny sides heats up faster then the plain side does.,2
154120,"If Laura wanted the inside of the car to stay cool then she would need to put the sun shade towards the inside of the car to stay cool. If we faced the sun shades out of the car, i think that the car's temperature would be warmer than the outside air.",2
154137,The wind shield will keep out the heat from the inside of the car. It will help keep cool inside so when you enter it will not be hot.,2
154114,It should face out of the car because the shiny part is the reflective part and that part should reflect the sun off the car.,4
154121,it want touch the glass,2
154131,The shine would reflect the heat outward so it does,3
154125,so the sun bonsis out.,4
154123,so it reflex the heat outside,3
154313,Because the shiny part will reflect the light back away instead of soaking up the heat.,4
154315,I said out of the car because the light reflects off of shinny objects. The shinny side is like the tinfoil flap on our solar ovens.,4
154304,I chose this because the shiny side will reflect the heat away from the car.,3
154704,The shinny part faces outside so the sun rays will reflect off the material and out of the car.,4
154303,"I think the sunshade should face toward the outside of the car because since that part is shiny, it's reflective as well which should reflect the heat. She should not use the other side because since that side is not reflective, it would get absorbed by the heat, as well as the sunshade is a dark color.",4
154309,"If the shiny part of the sun shade is facing the inside off the car, the non- shiny part will be facing the sun. But you want the shiny part facing the sun so it will reflect the heat off the car.",4
154316,It should face the outside to reflect the light from getting in.,4
154312,toward the outside so then it would reflect the heat back out,3
154302,You should have it face the outside of the car because that's where the heat is coming from.,2
154314,Because there is still a way to reflect heat to the car if the mirror part was facing inside,3
154317,It should face out for the beams will shoot back because its shiny.,3
154320,"Anything shiny like tinfoil or something reflects light, reflects the light away from the car rather than either absorbing or just being there.",5
154344,I chose this answer because the shiny part reflects the sun's heat off of the car and make it cooler.,4
153997,you want it toward the outside because you want it go toward the sun and because its a light color.,3
153989,I think this because the fatter side will block more heat.,2
154000,so the shinny part reflects the sun rays back out of the car,4
153981,"The shiny part is used like the tinfoil in our solar ovens. The sun rays will bounce off of the shiny surface, keeping the car cool. Another example is when you want a sun tan. Some people use that kind of material and angle it towards themselves because the sun rays bounce off of it.",4
153980,Because the Sun's rays will bounce off of the shiny side instead of coming in.,4
153996,I choose the very shinny side because the other side the air can go through.,2
154026,You should place the shiny part on the outside because the shiny side reflects the heat away from the car.,3
153985,"It should face out of the car, because it will reflect the heat away from the car.",3
153999,the shiny part bounces of the heat so the car does not get hot.,3
154138,Because it reflects of of it.,3
154115,It should face outside of the car so that the heat that goes towards the car gets reflected away by the shinny side.,3
154142,The outside because the shiny part is going to have sun rays that are going to make heat.,3
154109,The shiny part should face the outside of the car because it will reflect the sun.,4
154306,I think the sunny side of the sunshade will reflect most of the sunlight.,4
154340,I chose the first one because if its out side the car the wind can blow it of.,2
154846,The shiny part of the covers should be facing the outside because it will reflect the heat a lot better than the dark colors.,3
154149,Its so it's easy to place and it will block most of the air.,2
154129,I does this because it will reflect out.,3
154156,Because inside is blocking the sun heat and won't get in the heat.,2
154915,It should face out of the car so the radiation hits the sun shade and bounces away.,4
153993,The shiny part should face the outside so the sun bounces of the car.,4
153816,"The shiny side should face outwards so it reflects the sun's rays, keeping the car cool.",4
153818,"If the shiny part is outside, then it will reflect more light and heat up less.",4
153822,she should put the shiny side first because the shiny side will have the sun reflect off of the car.,4
153823,Out of the car because it will reflect off of the shinny part.,3
153824,"The shiny part will reflect heat, making it go into the outside atmosphere, not he atmosphere of the car. if the shiny part was in the inside, the heat would just bunch up in the car shade.",3
153826,because if it is already shiny it will not be affected by the sun so the inside of the car will stay cool.,2
153827,put it inside so if the sun wants to get inside the car o if you put them on the inside thn it will block th sun from coming in,3
153830,The shiny part will reflect the sunlight from the car so the energy goes outwards instead of in the car.,4
153831,Out because then it will deflect the heat rays.,3
153832,The shinny one is better it reflects the sun,4
153834,The shiny part makes it so that the sun stays on the out side because the shiny part attracts sun.,3
153835,She should put the shiny part on the outside because if she put it o the inside the hiny part might atract heat,2
153836,If it was facing out of the car the sun would atract to it and it would make the car hotter.,3
153837,Toward the out of the car because then the sun can reflect off something.,4
153838,i chose inside of the car because sun react to leather,2
153843,because if you put it on the out side it will just blow away but on the inside it keeps sun out and it won't blow,3
153844,because the sun if facing it so it would be shiny.,3
153845,"I think the shiny part  it should be on the  outside of the car because it would be blocking the sun from the outside.
The not so shiny part should be on the  inside of the car just to make sure the sun is not getting in it",3
153848,I think it is out of the car because if she has it on the non shiny part facing out then it will attract more heat. So it is better to have it on the shiny side facing up. You want the shiny side facing up! Like who would want more heat in their car! You always want to stay cool!,2
153852,outside of the car because it will reflect the bright light back,4
153854,So then the heat will bounce on and off of the car. Then the car wont get to hot.,3
153856,Because she is trying to get the heat from coming inside of the car.,2
153859,because it will let the heat bouce off the siver panil,3
153863,For the shine will shine on the other side,2
153864,it should face outside the car because that is the side where it shines light away.,3
153905,The shinny affect reflects the sunlight off the car.,4
153906,Because it will reflect the suns rays so it will not be as hot,4
153908,So the shiny one reflects the sun out of the way!,4
153909,the shiny side would attract the sun rays the non shiny would bounce it back.,4
153910,So the sun will face the other way from the shiny side. It also works like a mirror so if the sun faces the outside the shiny part will make it reflect the other way.,4
153911,i think the suns rays maybe bounce off the shiny side and back into the sky or space ans the other side keeps more darkness so more shade,4
153913,because it can keep your car cool inside and some one might steal it,2
153914,I think the shiny side will attract the sun more.,3
153915,if its outside it wont do anything,2
153916,So the sunlight reflects off of it.,4
153917,I think think because it will work.,2
153918,if its inside the glass will get hotter,2
153919,I chose this so the sun could hit it and reflect right back into the atmosphere,4
153921,Out of the car because then the heat will get into your car but the shinny part will protect the inside.,2
153922,shiny things also reflect the sun,4
153923,I think it should be going out because than the radiation will bounce out.,4
153924,if you put the tin out side it put more heat in the car,2
153925,it keeps your car cool,2
153926,Out of the car because if the sun hits the shiny part it will reflect of the sun shade. If it faces the inside of the car the sun can come through a car an reflect into the inside of the car.,4
153927,because if it is in the inside it wont be hot,2
153928,It has to be facing towards the sun or outwards because the sun reflect on it.,4
153929,It will reflect off the sun makeing it go in different derections,4
153930,It would face out so the sun reflects off it and it does not make the car hot.,4
153931,inside the car because it would protect the sun from inside,3
153932,inside the car because someone can sele them,2
153935,"I chose the inside of the car because when you have it inside it will shade everything, but when you put it on the outside it won't shade everything and so some things will get really hot.",2
153936,toward the inside of the car that why is not go to get hot,2
154112,It should face the out the car so the heat goes another way.,2
154118,the shiny surface wil reflect the sun,4
154119,It will warm up the car again if the dark side (not shiny) is pointing to the sun. The lighter colors keep the car cool.,3
154122,so the not shiny would be less hot,2
154124,It should be facing out because it will reflect the heat and light outside.,4
154127,I chose this because if the shiny part faces out of the car it will repel the sunlight.,3
154128,The shiny part will reflect the rays from coming in.,4
154130,"it has a out and it protest it for no heat to come in,",2
154132,it should be facing the outside because then it will reflect the sun,4
154134,Out of the car because the sun will reflect on the outside of the car.,4
154135,it should go to the outside because the shiny part is like a difflector mirror so it will defflect the suns rays,4
154141,It will reflect the sun outside of the car.,4
154143,inside because i seen it in real life to protect the seat and handle.,2
154145,It should face the out of the car so that the shiny part can  make the light to go the other direction.,4
154147,If you do it in the outside then it wont be as effective as if you place inside.,2
154148,because you need the shinny part to block out the sun and keeping the car cool.,3
154150,it protects,2
154152,Because my mom has one and she puts it on the  inside and it is cold after.,2
154153,Because the shny gets out,2
154162,it would reflect the suns light into the sky and would not go through.,4
154193,the shine will make the sun and the light rebound and will not let the heat get inside.,3
154194,The shiny part of the shade will not absorb the energy but will reflect it making it bounce off and out of the car. The other side will absorb the energy and will let the energy through. This is why you would put the shiny side to the outside and not inside,5
154195,The shiny parrt faces outside because then the suns energy can be reflected back to its source,4
154196,I choice this because if it is in the car facing in the car will take the heat of the sun.,3
154197,"The sunlight will be absorbed through the shiny part and will go through the sun shade and into the car, making it hot.",3
154198,The shiny part will reject the heat and go outside of the car,2
154199,Out of the car because then the heat would make the sun would reflect back making the heat not able to get into the car.,4
154200,it should face the outside because when the sun comes the shiny side reflects off the car. and doesn't make it a hot.,4
154201,I picked this answer because the hat won't be attracted to the car.,2
154202,"the shiny part would act as a mirror, making the light go the other direction, making it the valid choice.",4
154204,out of the ca because it wiill not be hot,2
154205,The foil will face the sun and outside the wind can blow it away.,2
154206,So the heat doesn't touch the glass and makes it hotter.,2
154207,She should be it toward the inside of the car because if she puts it out side of the car the wind cold blow it away and if in the inside the wind wont blow it away,2
154208,The shiny part reflects the solar energy away from the car.,4
154210,It should show on the outside because then it would reflect the sun.,4
154211,the shiny side would reflect the sun so it should face the outside.,4
154212,i think this will work better because the sun will preject of it and have the sun not come in the side the car.,3
154214,because the shiny part will reflect the sun,4
154215,because it cant fall down,2
154216,The shade make the sun not point in.,3
154218,so the sun doesn't reflect into the car and if the shades are there then the sun wont go into the car,4
154220,i dont know,1
154221,if you had it the otherway around the the sun would bounce off the blocker and in the car.,4
154224,Out of the car because you do not want,2
154226,If it in the outside it is going to burn.,2
154228,because it hits the sun faster.,2
154307,I think it's best to put it on the inside of he car because then the sun shade will make the inside cool.,2
154318,because i just think that and it is hard to explain,1
154319,I believe this because is the shiny part is facing outside the shiny part of the sun shade will soak up the radiation instead of the radiation just passing by the sun shade.,3
154321,I think it should face the outside of the car so the sun will reflect off of it,4
154322,"i am not for sure, but maybe if it is against the sun the heat will bounce back.",4
154323,so it reflects,3
154324,"If it is facing toward the car, it won't make a difference but if it faces away it will reflect the heat.",3
154325,"If you faced the shiny side to the person, the non shiny part will just absorb the sunlight, thus making it hot, if you made the shiny part face the sun, it will deflect the light and make the light face another way, this way it does not heat up the car.",5
154326,If it is on the outside of the car than the sun will reflect of of it.,4
154327,out of the car so the heat/light reflects off of it,4
154329,outside so the heat does not reflect in side the car.,3
154330,You should keep in toward the inside of the car because it will keep all he cool air in and bloke the hot air out and keep the car cool.,2
154335,So the sun will reflect itself out of the car and keep away the sun.,4
154336,buces if outside it will bolw away,2
154337,The part that Laura would like is that her car is not that hot when she gets her car back. If he protects the car from the inside than it will not heat up has much. The outside of the car is going to be hot but the inside is not if it is protected by the shield.,2
154342,It would face the outside to reflect sun rays from hitting the inside of the car,4
154343,i think its better fror the thing to be out side  because it wont het up the car,2
154345,So inside the car does not get heat but the outside get some heat ad it might blow away when it outside.,2
154353,so she can still see well she is diving and it will be cooler,2
154371,Becouse it reflects the light,4
154155,it blocks the the heat rays of the car,3
154151,i dont  no,1
153824,"The shiny part of the car shade should be facing outwards because when the solar radiation hits the car shade, if the shiny side is facing outward, the solar radiation will be reflected elsewhere.",4
153822,She should put it on the out of the car because then the sun will reflect off into another place so the car will not heat up.,4
153844,I think toward the inside of the car because when i was doing the solar ovens my partner and I put tin foil outside to attrack heat so maybe if we face it towards the inside maybe it will not attrack so much heat.,2
153852,We chose out of the car because we're trying to keep heat from coming inside of the car.,2
153838,Toward's the inside because the sun would cause convection to the sun an if you have the shed blocker right in front it would not  react to the glass.,3
155053,It should be facing the outside of the car to bounce sunlight off of it to keep the front of the car from getting hot.,4
153831,Because the heat will reflect out and will not let the heat in.,3
153816,Shininess reflects radiation,4
153823,Out of the car because the sun will reflect off of the shinny part.,4
153837,Outside of the car so the heat can reflect off the shade into the atmosphere. Also because the car wouldn't heat up as much.,3
153864,"You should put the shiny part toward the outside of the car because, you want the sun rays to bounce away from the car instead of inside the car.",4
153923,So the sun's radiation ca bounce off.,4
153928,"Out the car because the sun rays has to reflect on something back out, if you put the dark side facing out the sun rays wont reflect but it will probably get absorbed.",5
153909,"The shiny part should face the outside of the car because the shiny part will reflect the light back towards the sun, keeping the car cool inside.",4
153913,So the heat can bounce of the car and not inside.,3
153917,because it will reflect the sun out of the car,4
153916,The shiny part should face outside the car because it will reflect any sunlight and keep Laura's car cool.,4
153935,I picked toward the inside of the car because when it's on the outside of the car some of the heat can still get into the car.,2
153922,shiny things reflect sun off of that object,4
153921,Out of the ar because it will reflect away from the car but if you have it inside it will reflect inside the car and make it hotter.,3
153911,the not shiny part is like a shade for the inside of the car,2
153930,If it faces inside the car nothing happens. If you face the shiny part out of the car then it will reflect off the light and that's what you want.,4
154112,She should put it on the outside because then sun will reflect off it and shine it somewhere else.,4
153926,If the sun hits the shiny part facing the outside of the car then it will just reflect back. If it faces the inside of the car and the sun is at angle and hits it then it will reflect into the inside of the car.,4
153908,Out the car so it reflects back out of the car so heat doesn't get trapped in the car.,4
153905,The shiny surface would result in radiation being reflected away from the car.,4
153918,if its insid the glass would get hotter,2
153906,It will reflect the suns rays.,4
153919,It should be the facing the outside of her car becaue it will make the radiation hit it and reflect it back into the atmosphere.,4
153914,You would want the shiny side facing out side because then the sun will reflect off of it and not into the car.,4
153927,because when it is on the out side it will stay collor on the inside,2
154135,so the heat will reflect even more.,3
154124,The shiny part should be facing the outside of the car to reflect the light outside of her car.,4
154132,Because the shiny part will reflect the sunlight like  tinfoil flap on a solar oven.,4
154162,the glass would make it hotter.,2
154134,The shiny part should face out of the car to reflect the sun rays out of the car.,4
154153,so it will reflect.,3
154118,it will reflect the sunlight back.,4
154155,it will reflect the UV rays off the car.,4
154119,Toward the inside of the car because if it was toward the outside of the car the heat would be absorbed into the car. The dark color will block the heat instead of absorbing it.,3
154130,i chose that because it refease that sun out out of the car inside .,3
154150,i would do the shinny side becasyye it wouldn't absorb the heat so it would reflct from it.,4
154122,Cause the shiny side will reflect the heat.,3
154127,I chose out of the car because shiny materials reflect energy while non,4
154143,because the the out side car is hot and it has tinfoil and when it up it can get on fire,2
154128,"The shiny part reflects light, so you want it facing were the sun will hit and it will reflect out of the car.",4
154141,You want to have the shiny side facing out of the car so the sun can hit the windshield than reflect out of the car. If you use the inside of the windshield its not shiny and its a dark color so more sun can hit the windshield.,4
154145,It should face out of the car because when the sun reflects on the shiny part it would reflect in front.,4
154208,The shiny part will reflect radiation.,4
154202,The shiny part would reflect the light outwards and away from the car.,4
154193,The shiny will reflect the heat out so the heat wont get inside of the car.,3
154200,well when the sun hits he carsthe sun will bounc off the windshield,4
154206,The shiny part will reflect some solar radiation.,4
154212,i think this because it would reflect the heat out of the car and get it so not as much gets inside the car.,3
154214,because it will reflect heat and not absorb it.,4
154218,well if it is facing out of the car then the sun will hit it and then reflect back to it.,4
154221,The shiny side will also attract heat and then the sun shade will heat up.,2
154226,if she does it in the out side of the car it's going to heat up and the car will become more hotter.,2
154217,so your seats wont get hot and it will be a little cold but not alot of it just a little,2
154199,Out of the car because the shiny side will reflect the heat and sun off.,4
154198,If the shiny part faced out the window would get really hot,2
154215,beause it could fall outside or it coud be stolen.,2
154196,I chose this because if it is facing the outside of the car it will reflect the suns radiation outward.,4
154201,The sun will not affect the car and everything inside so it won't heat up fast.,3
154205,If the windshield is outside of the car the car is more likely to get heat inside the car because the reflector is outside.,2
154197,Out of the car because the shiny part will reflect heat from getting into the car.,3
154204,It should face the outside out of the car because then the car will stay cool then facing the shiny part on the inside because the car because the the car will gt hotter if the shiny part is inside the car.,2
154195,I think the reflector should face out of the car because it will reflect the heat energy away from the car's windshield.,4
154311,it will reflect the heat to the other side and t will go out side.,3
154322,the shiny side should show to the outside of the car because the heat can reflect off of the car.,3
154310,I tink it would be the inside of the car because the con vonvection can still go through if its on the outside but in the inside in wont go through,2
154327,Out of the car so the incoming light will reflect off of it.,4
154326,the shiny part will reflect the sun away from the car.,4
154324,It will reflect heat if it is facing away from the car because it is shiny and if it faces at the car it just reflects the heat back in the car.,3
154319,I beleive this becaue it acts like a reflector reflecting radiation away from her car instead of the radiation hittting her car.,4
154343,the foil type matirial refects the radiation and keeps the car from getting to hot inside,4
154307,The out of the car because since it is shiny then the light will reflect off the windshield and not touch her car.,4
154371,becase it bounces the heat out so it does not let it in.,3
154353,because it wont fly off the car windows.,2
154336,beacuse the sun will reflect off the shiny part,4
154325,"If the shiny part faced the inside of the car, the non-shiny part will absorb all the heat which would make it hotter on the inside. If you put the shiny part towards the outside of the car, it will deflect the heat because of its shinyness and how reflective it is.",4
154329,Toward inside the car because then if the sun hits the shiny part it will be hot when you touch it.,3
154323,the shiny part will reflect the sun,4
154345,To keep inside the car cooler.,2
154703,because if it is facing in words it would be hot because the sun reflects in the car.,4
155334,Because it dog,1
153836,"The more reflective side reflects solar rays better than the other side, she does not want heat into the car so having the reflective side would work best to keep out heat and solar rays.",4
153834,"The shiny part will reflect the heat out, keeping the car cool.",3
153863,If it is reflecting the outside of the car it will have the sunlight go in a different direction.,4
153843,if it is on the outside it will blow away but on the inside it will stay and protect the heat,2
153826,It will reflect the light away from the car,4
153848,If you have the shiny side facing out then when the heat hits the sun shade it will reflect out of the car. If you have it the other way round then it will attract more heat. Who would want to walk into a hot car?,3
153835,The shiny side will reflect the heat out of the car instead of inside the car so the heat won't go into the car it will reflect out of the car.,3
153860,If it is faces the outside of the car it will reflect the light off of the car.,4
153827,if they were out side there would be little cracks,2
153830,You need the shiny part facing outward so the sunlight can reflect off of it which would send the heat away from the car.,4
154514,out of the car because when the sun hits the car the shiny part will reflect the suns rays out.,4
153859,it will block the heat better,2
153832,it will reflect the sun away from the car cooling it of,4
153854,The heat will see the shiny part of the cover and the sun will try to warm up the car but the heat will bounce right out of the car and back to the  atmosphere.,4
153839,If it faces the outside of the car the sun will not get trapped inside the car because if the shinny.,4
153818,The shiny side of the sunshade reflects more radiation from the sun so it cant be absorbed and turned into heat.,5
153915,so then the shiny part wont reflect of the glass,3
153925,that will keep the inside cool.,2
153912,Radiation,2
153924,if you put it in the in side for it could hit the glass and go back,2
154148,Because if we face it out the light will bounce out of the car keeping it cool.,4
154152,Because it keeps the car more cold and if its in the outside then it can fly away,2
154160,because it makes it colder.,2
154157,I think you should use it toward the inside because if you put it out of the car someone can rob it and you want it to be cool inside,2
154147,I chose the inside because the windshield blocks the most of the uv light from the outside and the windshield block the heat from the inside.,3
154159,because the wind sheald bloks the heat frome the out side petects it frome the inside.,2
154161,The reason is that if you put the side that is shiny the car won't get really hot.,2
154146,Outside because the lighter part will make he sun go away. So ya like I said pick the lighter side.,3
154211,The shiny part should face the outside because it would reflect the heat away from your car.,3
154210,The shiny part will reflect the heat backwards.,3
154318,Outside of the car because ot will reflect the light.,4
154194,The shiny part will reflect the energy and sunbeams out of the car.,4
149950,Because if the dark side is facing out the son goes into it.,2
149966,The shiny stuff will reflect the suns heat.,3
149972,"That will keep most heat from entering and let heat that has entered, escape.",2
149959,because someone driving down her street can get blinded because the shiny part is very shiny,2
149953,The shiny things attract less things than usual.,2
149970,The shiny part reflects the heat.,3
149590,because the shiny part will reflect the sun and make it stay away from the car,4
149956,it does not effect that mich,2
149961,it reflects the sun,4
149588,"Out of the car because if the shiny part is inside, then it will go through the fabric and will get the car hotter.",3
149955,I think this because it cam only observe the shiny part,2
149967,so the sun cant go in the car to keep it cool,3
150648,I choose out of the car because then the sun can reflect off of the shiny side,4
149965,The shiny part should face outside the car because the Sun will reflect back.,4
149962,pointing to the outside of the car can block the sun,3
149971,so it won't get hot inside,2
150065,"The shiny part would reflect heat from the car.  If the non-shiny part faced out and the shiny faced in, the shiny would reflect the rays of sun trying to get out.",4
150066,I think it should go inside the car because then it would bounce the heat off the car and back into the air. If you do it on the outside of the car then it could go in a different direction and the heat will transfer in the car.,2
150074,To make sure that the light does not get attracted to the dark side.,3
150076,"I am not sure for this question, but I think the shiny part of her windshield should be facing inside the car. I thought of these questions while I was thinking about it. Can it attract heat too? If people walk past my car, the shiny part can hurt their eyes.",2
150073,The shiny part will attract heat,2
150078,The shiny side reflects the sun.,4
150072,"I chose out of the car because when the metal sheet is faced towards the sun, it reflects the sun off the car.",4
150075,It should  face outwards so that the sun's rays reflect off the shiny part.,4
150077,"When heat reflects on something shiny, the heat will bounce off of the material and not be as hot.",3
150069,This is my answer because picture 2 is trying to keep the sun out so its kind of absorbing up all the sun that wants to get into the car.,3
151162,if its out of the car then the metal outside of the car will be hot instead of the inside.,2
150052,I picked that one because it reflects the sun from coming inside the car.,4
150067,so it reflects the sun,4
150063,I chose this answer because the light will reflect off the shiny part.,4
150056,The shinesses with reflect off of the heat so the car doesn't get too hot.,3
150061,I said out the car because the shiny part will reflect the sun and heat.,4
150059,it would help it  by having the sun go through,3
150062,"It should reflect on the outside of the car because when the heat goes through the glass, the heat will just reflect back towards the sunlight.",3
150064,If the shinny part wis in the window the shinny part will send the heat back up in the sky.,2
150079,It will not let the sun in the car or on the outside.,3
150053,if the shiny part is facing the sun the sun will bounce off instead of being attracted to the the non shiny side,3
150054,The shiny side should face outwards so it can support reflecting the heat.,3
150055,toward the inside of the car so it wont be hot inside and so it wont slip off.,2
150058,becose it blos het,2
150060,Heat/light will reflect of the shiny part.,4
150071,The dark shade will block out more sun because it is more dark.,3
150085,I chose this answer because the shiny side will reflect the sunlight/heat away form the car making it stay cool.,4
150104,that way the sun can be reflected and bonuses of the shiny part,4
150101,I chose out of the car because the shine of the sun shade is deflecting the sun rays from getting the car hot,4
150105,The shiny part should be on the outside because it would reflect the sunlight better than having the normal side out.,4
150109,The shiney part should be in the outside part because the shiney part of the object will reflect.,3
150086,to keep more shade in,2
150097,if the black part of the sunshade is on the outside that the sunshade is going to obsorb heat.,3
150114,it covers the heat in side the car,2
150094,it does not heat up the car,2
150082,If you put the shiny part toward the outside of the car the heat will bounce of.,3
150090,so the heat reflcts off of it back to the sky so it doesnt get in your car and stays away from your car,3
150092,because if it was out side someon get move it,2
150111,because you can not leave it on the outside,2
150112,because it bounces of the window.,2
150096,i saw people use them  and they put it in ther car,2
150132,"I chose Out of the car"" because the shiny part will reflect the sun and point it toward the sky instead of in the car.""",4
150133,If it is out of the car the light will bounce off the shiny part.,4
150130,The shiny part will reflect the sun away from the car.,4
150127,I think it should be pointing outward because is the shiny part were pointing outward the sun would bounce off of the shiny part.,4
150117,I picked the outside of the car because the sun can reflect on it and then it will bounce off and go to the other direction,4
150115,So it bounces off,3
150124,the shiny part should be facing the sun to reflect the heat.,3
150131,The shiny part is foil. Foil can make the heat waves bounce of. Something in what foil is made of does that.,3
150134,I chose out of the car because shine reflects the sun.,4
150145,if its inside it will go threw the window,2
150137,I chose on the outside of car because I think that having the shiny part on the outside it will deflect the sun's radiation.,4
150149,If the sun shade is dark gray and shiny I would put it on the inside because sun also gives off more heat to something shining to the  sun.,2
150140,"I chose the shiny sun shade because the other one, it might heat up Laura's car too much.",2
150122,I chose facing the outside because the shiny part will bounce the heat back out instead of getting obsorbed into it.,4
150123,"I choose outside of the car because if it was inside then it would of trapped the heat in the car, but if it was outside then the heat would bounce off of the shiney side to someplace else.",4
150138,So it does not get stolen.,2
150136,"If you were to leave the shiny sun shade facing the sky, the sun would radiate off of it, which interferes its access to the inside of the car.",3
150142,shiny will go back ooutside,2
150116,It will repel the sun light away.,3
150148,i chose this answer so the sun can glare off the shade,3
150128,The shiny side would reflect the sun out of her car.,4
150144,The light will bounce off the car and face the other way.,3
150516,I chose the lighter one because it doesn't get as hot,2
150143,The sun reflects off it.,4
150146,The shading should be placed on the outside of the car so that when the light is shined on it it will reflect and not cause the car to be hot.,4
150195,It should face the outside of the car because the shiny side is like a mirror and reflects the sun.,4
150200,I chose the inside because it will reflect off of the window and if it passesthe window it will hit the windshild,3
150198,I think mainly because it wont be blocking the cars as much,2
150158,Because someone could take it or the wind could push it away,2
150159,It reflects the hotness and sun of the car.,4
150153,the shininess of the visor directs the heat away from the car,3
150162,"The outside of the car is metal right? So, the hotter it is outside,  the hotter it is in the car. Its like this because the outside of the car obsorbs the heat of outside.",3
150173,The light will bounce of the shiny part of the windshield,4
150164,It would defeat the purpose of the sunshade if you put the side that had a reflector on it towards the inside of the car.,2
150178,I use this in my car and i know how it goes and it goes where the shiny part is going in the outside.,2
150166,Because if its facing outside the heat will come inside the car but if its facing outside the heat will come inside.,2
150160,the shiny prt should face the outside so the sunlight will be reflected outwards.,4
150155,we want it facing the outside of the car so it reflects the sun.,4
150172,I think this because if its on the outside its not going to deflect the heat that would be going in the car.,3
150163,out of the car so the glass doesn't get hot,2
150157,it will reflect the heat out of the car,3
150174,because it will protect the car.,2
150167,The shine will shield the inside of her car.,2
150168,Why I chose out of the car is because the shiney part will reflect the sun.,4
150170,i think she should do outside because the won't really matter if she only wants the paint. Also if she wants choice number 2 that would only protect her seats and nothing else.,2
150199,If it is inside the car some sun will enter the car so when Laura enters her car it will be hot.,3
150196,f,1
150156,jvjksa,1
150243,She should point the shiny part away from the car because the sun will reflect away from the car.,4
150204,The shiny part will reflect the suns heat rays.,4
150244,Cause the heat will bounce back out off the car.,3
150219,The shiny part should face outwards because it will reflect the sun/heat.,4
150231,so the shade dosent get hot and burn up.,2
150236,Out the car because if you do the shiny toward the inside it would get hotter than if it face out of the car.,2
150246,It should face outside so the sun will reflect of the shine.,4
150240,"She should face the shiny part outwards because then the sun's rays don't go into the car, but bounce off of the shiny, mirror-like shade.",4
150242,The shiny side will send heat away because it is a bright color. So she should take the shiny side and make it face outside of her car.,2
150218,The shiny part is supposed to face the outside of the car so the sun can reflect off of it,4
150208,It should face the outside of the car so it can reflect the sun  the opposite direction of the car.,4
150235,"With the shiny part on the outside, sunlight can bounce off it and away from her car.",4
150220,The ouside of the car should have the shiny side on it so the heat bounces off more.,3
150228,the wind may just blow it off,2
150230,so the sun reflects of the car,4
150203,so it is able to block the heat from the sun.,3
150248,I picked this because that's how you put the shield shade.,2
150237,so the shiny deflects the heat outside not inside,3
150221,so the sun goes away,3
150206,so it blokes the sun in the inside,3
150247,because the sun reflects off of it.,4
150215,same as the car it will reflect of the siny part,3
150239,the shiny part would attract more heat and it would make it hotter.,2
150207,The shiny part will reflect the sun like tin foil.,4
150238,It would obsorb the heat from getting into the car.,3
150202,She should use it on the inside to the outside doesn't burn.,2
149590,because toward the car will make the car hoter.,2
150648,Out of the car so it can reflect the heat off of the car.,3
149953,I chose that answer because the shiny part reflects the heat away from the car.,3
150071,The dark side should take out most of the light,3
151162,in the inside the shade will cover the sunlight.,3
150067,Because it will deflect the sun away,4
150134,If it was inside the car it would make the car hotter because shine reflects the sun.,4
150123,"The shiney should face outside the car, so it bounces the heat off to somewhere else",3
150128,Thse shiny side should go out because it would reflect heat away from the car.,3
150136,So it will reflect back outside instead of shining down into Laura's car.,3
150122,I chose to face the shiny part outside because it would reflect the heat and sun rays away instead ob absorbing it and heating up inside.,5
150135,I chose towared the in side the car because you will get less heat.,2
150231,so no heat will get in.,2
150247,because its going to reflect the light.,4
150215,if you put it in the outside no heat will go in the car,2
149959,because the shining part is on the outside the sun rays could shine and blined a driver and could cause an accident,3
149970,the sun will reflect of the shiny part.,4
149967,so they reflect the sun,4
149957,"outwards,because the shiny part reflect the light,and you don't want the light to go inside of the car",4
149961,it will reflect the sunlight.,4
149954,so the light reflects the back.,4
150073,It won't blow away if there is wind and so the inside doesn't get hot.,2
150078,The shiny part is like a mirror it reflects the light.,4
150077,The shiny side will reflect the sun and will bounce off.,4
150062,"I chose the shiny part to face outwards because when the sun hits the car, the shiny part will reflect towards the sun and not in the car.",4
150076,"I am not sure for this question, but when I tested the solar oven, my group faced the shiny part of the tin foil outward. So, for my answer, I think it is suppose to be facing it out the car",2
150130,The shiny part will reflect the sun away from the car.,4
150115,It reflects the heat away from the car.,3
150149,Heat would easily get to a shiny side or object so to keep the car cool have the shiny part on the inside so that not as much heat gets to it.,2
150125,"You should put the shiny part on the outside because the heat will reflect of it and won't come in the car, kind of like a shield.",3
150124,I did this because then it reflects the heat. and makes the heat bounce off and not come in the car,3
150177,Say if the sun is shining really bright on the window so it will reflect off,4
150178,I choose the outside of the car because so the sunlight won't come in the car.,3
150198,I chose this because if its in the car it can block the heat from inside.,2
150175,The shiny part should go outside her door because it will reflect the sun.,4
150161,It will reflect the heat.,3
150196,so it does not get to hot because shinny refresh heart,2
150202,So it doesn't the heat as quickly.,2
150172,I said inside your car because if its on the outside then it wont keep it out of the car,2
150226,I say out of the car because it will reflect the heat,3
150204,The shiny side of the shade will reflect the heat but the regular side will let the heat inside and the car will get warmer.,4
150223,It needs to face the outside of the car so it can reflect any heat that is trying to get into the car like the solar oven the glass of the car will keep out the sunlight and keep the heat in so if there is something reflective in the window the heat and sunlight will bounce off of the car and not into it.That is why I think she should put it so it faces out of the car.,4
150145,it will not let it get more light,3
149968,It should shine in the out of the car because the shine will reflect.,3
149966,"The shiny part will reflect the sunlight back to where it came from, and not into the car.",4
149963,"I chose to have it facing out of the car because shiny things reflect heat like light colored things, they do not trap it in the car.",3
149586,"Its because she dose not have to worry if it blowed away,if nobody stolid it",2
149958,It should face out of the car because it will reflect the heat away from the car.,3
149589,The sun will reflect off the shiny part and away from the car.,4
149951,it will take off heat,2
149588,Toward the outside of the car so it can reflect off the shine and won't heat the car up.,3
149956,The shiny face should go out trward the car so the heat would go off in the window not go into the car. This will make it lees hot.,2
149587,"She should have the shiny side facing outside the car because when the heat comes close to the car, the shiny side will reflect it back into sky.",3
149962,The sun will reflect off of the shiny side  and reflect the opposite way,4
149972,The shininess will keep heat from entering while the dull side will let heat out.,2
149960,i say out of the car because it would reflect the the hot air when it tried  to get in.,2
150217,"I think that she put the sun shade out of her car because the heat will reflect outside of the car, instead of inside it.",3
150065,The shiny part reflects the heat away from her car if it is pointed in that direction.,3
150079,Because then the sun wont come in the car and will be reflected.,4
150061,I chose out of the car because shiny objects reflect like tin foil reflects heat.,3
150060,The shiny part of the sun shade should be facing out to reflect heat out of the car when it comes through the glass window.,3
150053,If the shinny part is facing the sun then when then when the sun hits the window shield it will reflect off,4
150063,The shiny side should face the outside of the car because it will reflect light.,4
150052,I chose that one because if it is in the car the glass will not let the heat that is shining off the car thing out.,2
150074,So that heat does not get absorbed into the dark side and heat in the car will be absorbed from the other side being put to the outside of the car.,3
150055,i  also say that toward the inside the car cause it will not be hot inside because  it will be right where the sun goes.,3
150064,the shinny part also attracts heat,2
150057,I chose out of the car because then the heat would bounce off the sun shade and outside the car.,3
150056,The shiny part will take the suns heat and reflect it out of the car the non-shiny part won't do that.,4
150070,because it will reflect the heat away from the car and not in the inside of the car,3
150075,The shiny side will reflect heat off of it.,3
150054,The shiny thing can support the bouncing heat.,3
150058,She sod do the sun saed on the inside becase the heat will not git in.,2
150111,it will bounce of the wind shield,2
150108,hit was 82C,1
150082,This will reflect the light off the car causing the car to not get as hot.,4
150083,It would be facing the outside of the car because the sun will go off the car if it's hitting the shiny part.,3
150127,The shiney side will (mostly) take all of the attracted light and bounce it back away from the car.,4
150117,I think the shiny part should be facing out of the car because the shiny part can reflect the sun and the sun's heat because it will bounce off and it would probably go the other direction.,4
150516,I chose toward the inside of the car because if you face it the other way the car will get really warm and Laura wants her car to cool down.,2
150137,Well since it is shiny it will just reflect the radiation back outside. But if you put it on the inside it will not let as much get in but it still will push though.,4
150133,She should face it towards the outside so that the solar radiation will bounce off the windshield and not towards the car.,4
150118,the shiny part can reflect the sun ray.,4
150121,why is the shiny is supposed to reflect the heat that comes in out. Thats why they made a sun shade to block the seats and the dash board. if it was inside the car it would look odd and different. it helps you from attracting sun its kinda like tin foil but back wards not adsorbent but reflecting.,5
150116,The sun shade will keep less heat from coming in the car. It will bounce of of the car and outside of it.,3
150141,So it cant attract heat,2
150120,it will deflect heat,3
150132,"I think it should shine out of the car because it will reflect the sun away from the glass, making the heat molecules bounce off of the car.",4
150167,So the suns rays can bounce off the car.,4
150168,I chose the answer out of the car because the shiny part will reflect the sunlight and not make the car so hot.,4
150170,I think outside of the car because the UV sunrays are gonna bounce of because the shiny part is a reflector.,4
150158,Because It makes the heat go somewhere else because its a light color,2
150173,When it is out of the car the shiny part would reflect the sunlight off.,4
150162,Put it outside so that it will bounce the sun rase off of the shiny part and back outside and not heat up the car as much.,4
150155,well they are going  to reflect heat and unless you want your car to get very very hot then I suggest that you but them on the outside to reflect away  from the car.,3
150174,It will deflect heat.,3
150156,nvfdsjne,1
150199,"If it is in the inside of the car, still some heat can get into the car.",2
150176,"If the sun shade is outside, it will attract heat outside of the car, if it stays inside, the sunlight will force it's way in the car and will start to heat up the car.",3
150235,"If the shiny part faces out of the car, sunlight will reflect off it and away from the car.",4
150241,When something is shiny you want it to reflect the sun in this case you want to cool your car down so you would let the sun reflect off not let the sun absorb.,5
150207,The shiny part should face the outside so it will reflect the sun.,4
150206,well if its inside that would do nothing. but ifs outside it will reflect the sun.,4
150221,It will bounce off of the shiny part and will go back towards the sun so her car is not that hot.,4
150208,The sunny side should be facing the outside of the car because it will reflect the sun to the opposite direction of the car.,4
150246,Out of the car so it can reflect off.,3
150244,So the heat reflects back out and not back in.,3
150249,If you put it on the outside it can fall.,2
150205,i said toward the inside the car because then inside will be more hotter tan the outside and if you put it outside it does noting.,2
155700,I think the shiny part is for drawing in the sun so making it face the outside of the car will make the car hot.,3
150228,it will just be blown by the sun,2
150218,So it can repel the sun,4
150242,I have seen my dad put the shiny part this way. It reflects a lot more heat than the color white.,3
150203,so it can reflect the heat off of the car.,3
150240,The reflector reflects the sun rays out.,4
150248,That is how you do it.,2
150237,so it reflects the heat out of the car instead of in,3
150219,"If the shiny part is facing outwards, it will reflect the sun, keeping the car from getting hot.",4
150220,The shiny part will keep the radiation from going into the car and warming it up.,4
150243,It should face away from the car because it acts like a reflector making the Sun's heat go away.,4
150230,The reflective material will reflect the sun off the car.,4
150238,if you put that reflector outside the car it won't protect the inside of the car.,3
150245,I chose this because it will reflect the sun out of the car instead of absorbing it.,5
150214,She will need it inside of the car because the sun can't get threw the front of the car.,3
150239,So all the heat deflects away from the car not at the car.,3
150236,Toward the out side because the sun will reflect off the shiny part and go the opposite way.,4
150201,Because the wind will not blow it away.,2
150197,I chose this option because it could then reflect the heat out of the car.,3
150163,because you want your car to not heat up so you put it out side for it to reflect the heat.,3
150159,Its reflecting the sun.,4
150160,The shiny part of the sun shade will reflect the heat out wards.,3
150165,Inside of the car because then it wont attract the sun as much it will block the sun from coming inside.,3
150154,She should use them on the inside so the sun will reflect off of it,4
150166,Because if it faces inside it wont heat up but if u face it outside it will.,2
150131,"The shiny part of the shader is aluminum foil. The foil acts as a reflector and since she wants the car to not contract heat, then she can face the shiny part out of the car.",3
150139,I chose this because when the heat tries to go inside of the car it the shiny one when will just reflect the heat the other way.,3
150140,It could block the inside of the car so it won't get heated up when Laura comes back.,2
150144,"The sun shade will reflect the heat to point out of the car, if the shade pointed in the car the car would get hot.",3
150143,This is because the sun will repell off of it,4
150119,The sun shade should face the outside of the car because so the goes away from the car and not in the car.,3
150129,it should be outside because if it was inside it woud get hot,2
150148,itll bonce off the heat,3
150142,she doesn't want her car to get hot,2
150138,the heat will bounce off.,3
150090,because then the sun reflects away from the car,4
150089,It should face outside the car because then the energy from outside can reflect back outside.,4
150098,"This is because the shiny side acts like tin foil, it reflects the sun off of it so the car doesn't get hot inside.",4
150114,it will mack it coler,2
150086,i can't explain,1
150106,if it is out of the car the inside of the car would heat up if you put it inside it would  be cold inside of the radiotion,3
150069,this is because you dont want your car to be boiling hot so you put the side that attracts heat facing your window.,2
150066,I picked on the inside because if the sun is inside of the car and the car is facing toward the heat then it would reflect the heat better on the inside than on the outside.,4
150072,Out of the car is better so the sun can reflect off the car.,4
150059,Since the shiny part is like foil it will help the heat reflect off.,3
149964,She should put it toward the inside because it will matter were the sun will hit the car.,3
149950,The sun protector should have the shiny part out because it reflects heat.,4
149955,I chose this because the heat will just bounce off.,3
149947,"If it faces out of the car, it will reflect the heat.",3
149965,The shiny part will reflect the heat towards the sun.,3
149969,So it does not soak up heat. If the darkside was facing the sun then it would get hot.,2
150650,Because it will reflect the heat off the car.,3
149971,cuz i said,1
150153,the shiney part reflects the heat away from the car.,3
150195,The shiny part should be facing out of the car because it needs to reflect the sun that try's to get in.,4
150194,Because the shiny part would deflect the suns rays off of her wind shield.,4
150164,The shade will reflect out wards.,3
150200,Because ti will reflect it back,3
150169,so the heat can reflect off of it,3
150101,I chose out of the car because the sun is reflecting onto the shiny part which the sunlight will deflect somewhere else.,4
150105,The shiny part should be facing the outside of the car so the sunlight will be reflected out.,4
150112,Because it won't go through the car and get the foil hot.,2
150085,I chose my answer because the shiny side will reflect the heat away from the car. Making it less hot.,3
150094,the shade will reflect the sun,4
150109,The shiny part should face the outside the car because the  shiny part would reflect the sunlight.,4
150080,that what you yous if you have a black car,2
150097,i chose that because it will reflect heat.,3
150087,It should face the outside of the car so that the light of the sun can go another derection that isen't the derection of the car.,4
150104,to reflect of the sun to a different direction,4
150092,it will reflect not move,3
150919,it needs to be in the insied because if it is inthe out side it can flie a wae or it can get stelled,2
150924,sunlight will reflect off the car,4
151186,I dont know,1
151195,because the siny part is like a mirror so it will reflect it back yet if the other side is a light color then i might work just not as much,3
151182,if you but the shinny part facing out it will heat the window,2
150923,it will feel hot,2
151193,i dont know,1
151230,,1
151228,they a bright color.,2
151217,i do not know,1
151227,its  toward the outside because if its inside the sun will make the car hot but if its outside the car wont get hot,3
151218,I think so the diver won't be hot.,2
151209,i dont know,1
151219,This will help by covering your  face and seats,2
150900,so the window is backup,2
150908,this is because shiny things will reflect out of the car.,3
150910,because its going to be distroded,2
150902,because they would be sitting I the sunlight.,3
150909,because they would sit outside,2
150904,i dont know.,1
150907,Because the sun is suppose to bounce off of the shiny part of the sunshade.,4
150905,"The shiny side will deflect the heat so if it is facing the outside of the car, the heat will be deflected out of the car.",3
151224,The shiny part is meant to reflect heat so the heat does not get trapped in the car,4
151204,you need to put it inside because the sun will reflex of your car.,3
151222,I think that sun shade would need to be facing out of the car because the sun would reflect on the shiny part and the sun would be pushed away and the sun wouldn't come in.,4
151212,"I chose this answer because if the sun protection was inside the car, on part of the car would be shiny which is the outside. The part of the sun protection that's behind the sun would be dark and not shiny like the part of the sun protection that's shiny from the reflection of the sun.",4
151205,It should face the outside of the car because the sun would shine on the shiny part of it and it would reflect the sun outside of the car and not get hot in the car.,4
151216,if you face it inside you car will just get hotter.,2
151203,if you put out of your car then it will mostly make the heat somewhere else,3
151215,If the shiny part is out of the car the light bounces off of it instead of it going in the car. :),4
151223,"The shiny side reflects the light sure, but it also makes it extremely hot.",4
151208,So the shiny part isn't going to crack the glass.,2
151202,i don't know,1
151206,I chose out of the car because the shiny part will reflect the sun and force it to go outside of the car.,4
151210,nose,1
151226,Because  when you put it in the car it gets hotter if you put it on the outside it you can block the sun better and it affects more!,3
151211,because she wants the inside to stay colder.,2
151231,inside is what has to keep cool,2
151207,So the sun rays will bounce of the the shiny part of the sun shade.,4
151229,it shin up,2
151192,It's good to see shiny things. :D,2
151188,If it is facing the inside it might start a fire.,2
151178,"I chose it to be facing outward because the material most likely reflects better then the not shiny part, which is most likely a cloth.",3
150915,You don't want to put it outside because you don't want it to be stolen,2
151199,it shoul be inside so then there wont be that much of a way for the heat to make it in the car,2
151191,both things go in the inside,2
151200,It faces the outside because it shades the car so it does not make sense for the hotter side to be facing the inside of the car and it will just warm the car up if the shady  part of the shade is facing the outside.,2
151165,the inside of the car because it  is going to be really cooler from toward the inside of the car.,2
151194,to block the sun,3
150922,because the shiny part will heat up the car,2
150917,"The sun would hit the shiny side and bounce off. But if you use the non-shiny side it'll hit the fabric, go through and make the car hotter.",5
151176,So the sun bounces off the shiny part of the shield.,4
151198,shiny things reflect the sun.,4
151174,the sun will NOT get in,3
150918,"I chose this answer because usually people put their shiny part of their shields towards the inside of the car, because shiny things always attract the sun, because of how it reflects and glints in the sky.",4
151190,if shes driving sun will get in her eyes but if its not facing her it wont get in her eyes,3
151181,out of the car for less heat.,2
151201,becuase it doesnt atract the sun,3
150916,because the wind can push the sun over or kids can take it.,2
151179,I think it should go Toward the inside of the car because then the shiney part won't be facing out because the shiner it is the hotter it will become,2
151225,i don't now,1
