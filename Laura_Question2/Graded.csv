118483.0,the shiny part will reflect the heat,3
139814.0,the shiny part should face out of the car so the sun rays reflect away from the car,4
150173.0,when it is out of the car the shiny part would reflect the sunlight off,4
118512.0,i think the shinny part will reflect the light which causes heat,4
150067.0,so it reflects the sun,4
154321.0,i think it should face the outside of the car so the sun will reflect off of it,4
136355.0,the shiny part should face out of the car because the sun s light will reflect off of it and bounce back into the atmosphere,4
118488.0,i think it should be like this because the sun will reflect from the shiny part back out,3
136375.0,because the shiny part of the shield keeps makes it reflect all of the sun out of the car,4
154323.0,the shiny part will reflect the sun,4
118579.0,it should face out the car because the shiny side will reflect light,4
153913.0,because it can keep your car cool inside and some one might steal it,2
149953.0,i chose that answer because the shiny part reflects the heat away from the car,3
139870.0,the shiny part of the sun shade reflects the suns rays which means it reflects the suns heat,2

154304.0,i think this because the shiny side will reflect the sun,4
140093.0,the shiny part should be facing outside because the shiny part is used to reflect the sun so that it would keep the car cooler than it would be if you didn t use it,4
150198.0,i think mainly because it wont be blocking the cars as much,2
136482.0,the shiny sun shade that would go on the window shield should face toward the outside of the car because the shiny side can and will reflect the sun back into the outside but if the non shiny side would suck up the light and push it into the car,4
153917.0,i think think because it will work,2
154342.0,it would face the outside to reflect sun rays from hitting the inside of the car,4
,nan,1
136518.0,the shiny part should face the outside of the car because the shiny part is supposed to reflect light and heat and a mirrored sun shade will probably be better at reflecting uv visible and thermal energy which means more of that energy is kept outside of her car,4
118947.0,,1
150142.0,she doesn t want her car to get hot,2
118517.0,it will reflect the heat of the car,3
150072.0,out of the car is better so the sun can reflect off the car,4

153908.0,so the shiny one reflects the sun out of the way,4
139540.0,a sun shade can reflect the sunlight out of the car and it would keep the car cool,4
154224.0,out of the car because you do not want,2
154152.0,because my mom has one and she puts it on the inside and it is cold after,2
139643.0,the shiny part should face out of the car because it will reflect the light and heat that is being radiated into the car,4
118613.0,it reflect the heat,3
118475.0,the shiny part will reflect the light heating up the car,4
118369.0,nan,1
136417.0,you inside of your car because you do not some thing to catch on fire,2
136550.0,if it is facing outside it will reflect the light outside if you do it facing the car it will reflect it into the car,4
118440.0,i think that when laura puts the sunshade up she should put them in the inside of the car because if you put them on the outside one someone could steal it two if there is wind it could blow away three it will heat the shade up and eventully the car will be hot,2
151230.0,nan,1
118361.0,,1
139527.0,the shiny part reflects light so that the car doesn t heat up,4
136414.0,if the shiny part is facing out of the car it will reflect the sun,4
139510.0,the shiny side will reflect the light rays more,4

153906.0,because it will reflect the suns rays so it will not be as hot,4
118568.0,porque nocalienta el caro,2
118309.0,because if it was outside it could blow away when your driving,2
149955.0,i think this because it cam only observe the shiny part,2
153922.0,shiny things also reflect the sun,4
154703.0,because if it is facing in words it would be hot because the sun reflects in the car,4
139537.0,the sun shade shiny s part should be facing the sun because the shiny part tends to reflect more light and solar radiation that the part where its not shiny this will cause the solar radiation to be reflected back and lessen the conversion of solar radiation to infrared radiation,5
139873.0,it would reflect the sunlight from the car,4
154210.0,it should show on the outside because then it would reflect the sun,4
118294.0,,1

154206.0,the shiny part will reflect some solar radiation,4
151210.0,nose,1
141563.0,if you put it of the car it wont be hot if you do it will be hot,2
136503.0,shiny things reflect light,4
118458.0,the sun shade will reflect the sun and make the solar radiation into heat if placed towards the car,5
139806.0,i think the sunny side will reflect the sunlight more effectively,4
118512.0,the shinny part should face outside of the car because the shine will reflect the solar radiation and not absorb i think the shinny side would reflect the solar radiation causing the car to be cooler,5
139768.0,the shiny part reflects the sunlight so the car can stay cool,4
118539.0,it will reflect the light back out,4
151191.0,both things go in the inside,2
153924.0,if you put the tin out side it put more heat in the car,2
118577.0,the shiny part will reflect light and not allow the car to heat,4
154214.0,because the shiny part will reflect the sun,4
139506.0,the shiny side prevents light from entering because it completely reflects all the light particles,4
139836.0,the shiny side should face out of the car because shiny things are used to reflect light reflecting light will reduce the heat,4
118396.0,put it toward the window,2

118472.0,,1
118577.0,nan,1
118608.0,the shiny part should face outside the car because if the sun shines on the shiny part it will be shined somewhere else meaning that the reflection of the sun will hit something else,4
154196.0,i chose this because if it is facing the outside of the car it will reflect the suns radiation outward,4
150900.0,so the window is backup,2
154313.0,because the shiny part will reflect the light back away instead of soaking up the heat,4
154220.0,i dont know,1
118590.0,the shiny part will reflect the suns rays,4
139845.0,it reflect the heat,3
153824.0,the shiny part of the car shade should be facing outwards because when the solar radiation hits the car shade if the shiny side is facing outward the solar radiation will be reflected elsewhere,4
118602.0,i chose the shiny part to face out of the car because the shiny part of the sun shade the sun will reflect off of the shiny part and no heat traped in the car,5
139535.0,the shiny side of the sun shade is reflective and will reflect light waves from the sun and direct them out of her car,4
139509.0,to reflect light outward and lessens the amount of light entering the car,4
139854.0,nan,1
151165.0,the inside of the car because it is going to be really cooler from toward the inside of the car,2
154111.0,i think this because when the light shines in the car the shield will reflect the light just a piece of glass it will keep the heat the heat away,4
136490.0,my dad had on and he would put it on the inside of the window facing out it reflects the light from the sun to the and back up in space,4
136520.0,because it will reflect the light out of the car,4
139477.0,the shinny part of the sun shade will reflect the light that is coming into the car so it keeps the car cooler,4
136499.0,the shiny part should face the outside because it will reflect more sun that way,4
154122.0,so the not shiny would be less hot,2
139832.0,the shiny side points to the outside of the car because it helps to reflect the light and not absorb as much heat,5
139798.0,it should face out of the car so the sun reflects the sun shade,4
139833.0,the shiny side can help reflect the radiation back out and prevent it from getting into the car,4
136519.0,you should put them that way so all the sun will reflect outwards so most of sun dose not go in,3
118621.0,,1
118556.0,it should be to the outside because the shiny thing can reflect the heat away from the car,3
118524.0,the shiny side of the windshield should face the outside of the car because the shiny side reflects the sun,4
136551.0,inside because it is the only logical thing to do because someone can steal it or the wind will blow it off,2
