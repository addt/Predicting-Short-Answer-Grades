118468.0,it should be out of the car because the shiny part will make the car hotter because the shiny part will reflect the sunlight into the inside of the car that makes the car warmer qand she wants the car to not be burning hot inside,4
149965.0,the shiny part should face outside the car because the sun will reflect back,4
154159.0,because the wind sheald bloks the heat frome the out side petects it frome the inside,2
139489.0,the shiny side will have a greater reflect than the not so shiny side since the shiny side reflects more it should reflect more sunlight and causing less sunlight to enter her car,4
118456.0,the shiny part should be facing out of the car because the sun would reflect off of it,4
150072.0,out of the car is better so the sun can reflect off the car,4
118311.0,out of the car because when the sunlight hits the wind shield the solar energy reflects back and keeps the car from heating up,4
136468.0,the outside of the car because on the shinny part of the windshield car reflect the suns sun rays towards the sky,4
136424.0,if it is facing away from the car it will reflect more light away keeping it cold,4
118571.0,the shiny part is the reflector so it will reflect the solar radiation,4
136505.0,the shiny part would face out of the car and it would result in the suns light to be reflected and reflect away from the car,4
118609.0,nan,1
154208.0,the shiny part will reflect radiation,4
118530.0,because if she put it toward is better and i think toward the car because i sew some people that put them inside the car so i think she might put itn toward the inside the car,2
118394.0,the shiny part reflects the sunlight,4
136419.0,the shiny side will reflect light and heat away from the car,4
139478.0,that way the radiation from the sun will reflect outside the car instead of inside allowing the care to be cooler because the shiny side is reflective deflecting the rays toward the outside,4
154326.0,the shiny part will reflect the sun away from the car,4
154313.0,i think this because the non shiny part would suck up heat,2
139514.0,the shiny side would reflect more light energy than just the light dull side so if the shiny part is reflecting more of the energy the car would be cooler,4
139844.0,the shiny part should face the outside of the car because it will reflect the light,4
136549.0,the shiny part should face the outside of the car so when the light hits it and reflects it doesn t go in the car but reflects out of the car i know this because when sunlight hits tin foil it gets hot and the shiny thing is like tin foil and also i took the sun visor out of the wind shield it was super hot,4
151206.0,i chose out of the car because the shiny part will reflect the sun and force it to go outside of the car,4
136390.0,the shinny part should face outside of the car because the shinny part reflects the light and heat causing the heat to leave and can t come in the car,4
118607.0,the shiny side of the sun shade will reflect light out of the car,4
118580.0,so the heat wont shine it the car so it wont get hot,2
149961.0,it will reflect the sunlight,4
136498.0,the shiny part should face out of the car because the shininess will reflect the suns heat and energy,4
118305.0,it has to be inside so it won t get hot inside,2
118469.0,,1
154224.0,out of the car because you do not want,2
139816.0,nan,1
118478.0,the shiny side will reflect heat from the car,3
136583.0,i choose this because most shiny things reflect light than other things,4
136495.0,it should face the outside because it will reflect light when it reflects light it will make it less hot in the car because no sunlight is getting inside,4
136354.0,face the shiny part at the sun because it will reflect most of the light,4
153824.0,the shiny part of the car shade should be facing outwards because when the solar radiation hits the car shade if the shiny side is facing outward the solar radiation will be reflected elsewhere,4
153978.0,the shiny side will reflect the sun away,4
118316.0,it should shine on the out side of the car because it will reflect the sun off it,4
136497.0,outside the car because the shinny side will reflect the light,4
150245.0,i chose this because it will reflect the sun out of the car instead of absorbing it,5
118609.0,it ll observe more heat to keep car cool,2
118607.0,putting the shiny part facing outward will mean the shiny material will reflect more light and heat,4
118524.0,the shiny side of the windshield should face the outside of the car because the shiny side reflects the sun,4
118554.0,it will reflect the light out of the car,4
139870.0,the shiny part of the sun shade reflects the suns rays which means it reflects the suns heat,2

151181.0,out of the car for less heat,2
154306.0,i think the sunny side of the sunshade will reflect most of the sunlight,4
118475.0,so it reflects the light out of the car,4
139832.0,the shiny part can reflect the light away so the car can stay cooler and not absorb as much heat,5
136392.0,since light can reflect from the shiny part is gonna go the other way and not toward the car,4
150130.0,the shiny part will reflect the sun away from the car,4
118576.0,the sun reflects off the shiny part,4
136402.0,you put it on the outside so the no heat will go in the car at all the sun shades reflect light heat,4
153913.0,because it can keep your car cool inside and some one might steal it,2
153816.0,shininess reflects radiation,4
118634.0,nan,1
136392.0,the shiny part acts like tin foil or aluminum foil and that will reflect off most of the light away from the car,4
139795.0,the sun shade on her windshield should face the shiny one so it reflects the sun,4
139494.0,the shiny part should face out of the car because its shiny and reflective surface will help the sun ray bounce off be reflected back so that the car can keep cool,4
136563.0,this will also reflect the heat away,3
154211.0,the shiny part should face the outside because it would reflect the heat away from your car,3
139517.0,if the shiny part is away from the car the shiny part will reflect the light instead of letting it inside making the car heat up less,4
136560.0,because the sunshade reflects the sun coming at her car when turn it out of the car,4
154340.0,i chose the first one because if its out side the car the wind can blow it of,2
153823.0,out of the car because the sun will reflect off of the shinny part,4
136503.0,this way the shades reflect the light to the outside of the car,4
118483.0,the shiny part will reflect the heat,3
118475.0,the shiny part will reflect the light heating up the car,4
139826.0,the shiny material reflects the sun s rays as it is a reflective material the reflective material does not absorb the sun s radiation and will not absorb heat if the material were on the other side it would probably retain the infrared radiation inside the car making it warmer,5
151215.0,if the shiny part is out of the car the light bounces off of it instead of it going in the car,4
139802.0,the shiny part should out of the car,2
139510.0,the shiny side will reflect the light rays more,4
154215.0,beause it could fall outside or it coud be stolen,2
118337.0,i picked my answer because the shiny part is like a mirror and mirrors reflect and you wantt o relfect the sun out of the car,4
136415.0,the shiny cover is going to reflect the suns rays back twords space and the sun or to another car,4
118419.0,it should go toward the inside of the car because the heat would refiton would not be as hot,3
150105.0,the shiny part should be facing the outside of the car so the sunlight will be reflected out,4
149589.0,the sun will reflect off the shiny part and away from the car,4
139775.0,the shiny part will reflect the sun better than the other side,4
118458.0,the sun shade will reflect the sun and make the solar radiation into heat if placed towards the car,5
139880.0,nan,1
136569.0,solar radiation would be reflected by the shinier side of the sun shade therefore keeping it cooler,4
139838.0,the shiny part should be facing out the car because the sun s rays will reflect off of the shiny part,4
154124.0,the shiny part should be facing the outside of the car to reflect the light outside of her car,4
118536.0,the shiny part reflects the sunlight so the sun won t get in the car,4
118402.0,because you want the suns heat reflecting away from the car,2
150143.0,the sun reflects off it,4
139537.0,the shiny part of the sun shade is the part that reflects light the most due to its reflective surface the solar radiation from the sun will bounce off preventing any solar radiation from converting to heat,5
118350.0,the shiny part should face the outside of the car because shiny colors reflect more light and if it is facing the outside than it will reflect the light away from the car,4
149958.0,it should face out of the car because it will reflect the heat away from the car,3
150052.0,i picked that one because it reflects the sun from coming inside the car,4
136490.0,my dad had on and he would put it on the inside of the window facing out it reflects the light from the sun to the and back up in space,4
139537.0,the sun shade shiny s part should be facing the sun because the shiny part tends to reflect more light and solar radiation that the part where its not shiny this will cause the solar radiation to be reflected back and lessen the conversion of solar radiation to infrared radiation,5
139496.0,the radiation sunlight hitting the window shield will reflected back into the air by the shiny part of a sun shade it will prevent as much heat from entering the car,4
154107.0,toward the inside of the car because the big window is attracts the most heat so that s why it should be in the inside of the car,2
136377.0,i choose this because the sun could reflect off,4
139483.0,the shiny part should be facing out the car because that means the radiation from the sun is being reflected back to the atmosphere not in her car and that is a good thing for laura because that means less radiation is penetrating her car to heat it up,4
139838.0,the shiny part should be facing out of the car so that the sun s light could be reflected keeping the interior cooler,4
139489.0,the shiny side has a higher reflectivity than the non shiny side and this will cause less radiation to go into car because the radiation is being reflected,4
151198.0,shiny things reflect the sun,4
118600.0,it will reflect the light,4
118561.0,if the the shiny part of the windshield shade faces outside of the car it ll reflect the heat away from the car,3
118444.0,the shiny side will reflect the light and heat,4
150163.0,out of the car so the glass doesn t get hot,2
139515.0,the shiny side has a greater reflectivity than the non shiny side so it should face out of the car in order to reflect light more efficiently this reduces the amount of light energy absorbed,5
139477.0,the shinny side will reflect the light out of the car keeping it cooler,4
154202.0,the shiny part would reflect the light outwards and away from the car,4
136520.0,because it will reflect the light out of the car,4
139524.0,the shiny material can reflect the light more than a not shiny surface can it is more similar to a mirror,4
154127.0,i chose out of the car because shiny materials reflect energy while non,4
136387.0,it should face to the outside so that the reflective side can reflect the rays from the sun,4
136551.0,inside because it is the only logical thing to do because someone can steal it or the wind will blow it off,2
149962.0,the sun will reflect off of the shiny side and reflect the opposite way,4
154345.0,so inside the car does not get heat but the outside get some heat ad it might blow away when it outside,2
150109.0,the shiny part should face the outside the car because the shiny part would reflect the sunlight,4
150157.0,it will reflect the heat out of the car,3
118623.0,the shiny part will reflect the light off of the car,4
139829.0,the shiny part reflects light and that is a reason why many people use the shiny part to tan for the car the shiny part should be facing outside so the sun could be reflected off the car,4
136502.0,because since its shiny it reflects heat off of it,3
154514.0,out of the car because when the sun hits the car the shiny part will reflect the suns rays out,4
118569.0,i think that the inside because if you put the screen on the outside people could steal it,2
154353.0,because it wont fly off the car windows,2
118517.0,it will reflect the heat of the car,3
150648.0,i choose out of the car because then the sun can reflect off of the shiny side,4
118395.0,toward the outside so the rays from the sun don t go in and they reflect of of the shiny side,4
154206.0,so the heat doesn t touch the glass and makes it hotter,2
154129.0,it is reflecting the sun s rays back to the sky,4
118613.0,it reflect the heat,3
139491.0,the shiny part face should be facing outside of the car because we want that shinny part to reflect as much sun light as possibly back into the atmosphere,4
139800.0,the shiny part should face out of the car because it will reflect all the sun rays and will not absorb the sun s radiation and heat if it were to face inside it would reflect the sun rays to the inside of the car and it would heat up,5
139785.0,the shiny part is able to reflect the sun light which also reflects most of the heat from the sun away from the car,4
118356.0,the shiny part will reflect light away from the car,4
150516.0,i chose the lighter one because it doesn t get as hot,2
151199.0,it shoul be inside so then there wont be that much of a way for the heat to make it in the car,2
118559.0,,1
153818.0,the shiny side of the sunshade reflects more radiation from the sun so it cant be absorbed and turned into heat,5
150101.0,i chose out of the car because the sun is reflecting onto the shiny part which the sunlight will deflect somewhere else,4
118355.0,it reflects the heat,3
136375.0,because the shiny part will reflect heat away from the car,3
139542.0,if the shiny part faces outside it will bounce the sunlight going towards the car away because shiny material reflects light more easily than absorbing it,5
118509.0,it will reflect the sunlight,4
118525.0,shinyness reflects the solar energy off,4
118357.0,the shiny one will reflect the light and heat and not absorbest,5
153917.0,i think think because it will work,2
136400.0,if it shines out it reflects the heat,3
153816.0,the shiny side should face outwards so it reflects the sun s rays keeping the car cool,4
136426.0,because it will reflect all of the heat out of the car,3
118528.0,to reflect the sun away from the car,4
118474.0,ityhjmgbovietrhsybgjv octeiwoyh eriu,1
154200.0,it should face the outside because when the sun comes the shiny side reflects off the car and doesn t make it a hot,4
,nan,1
139853.0,the shiny part is outside because it reflects the light,4
118512.0,the shinny part should face outside of the car because the shine will reflect the solar radiation and not absorb i think the shinny side would reflect the solar radiation causing the car to be cooler,5
118442.0,so the sun reflects off the shiny part,4
149954.0,so the light reflects the back,4
118315.0,this way the sun light reflects out of the car,4
136489.0,the light should reflect off of the shiny side going back out to the outside,4
118592.0,it will cover the inside so that the car from the inside will not get to hot,2
150062.0,i chose the shiny part to face outwards because when the sun hits the car the shiny part will reflect towards the sun and not in the car,4
151191.0,both things go in the inside,2
