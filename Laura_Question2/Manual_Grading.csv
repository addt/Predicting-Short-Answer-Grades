154130.0,it has a out and it protest it for no heat to come in,2
118614.0,she should put it on the outside of the car because if the shiny part is facing out the car it wnt be shining heat into the car,2
139525.0,the shiny fabric should face outside of the car because the solar radiation will bounce from the shiny fabric i m back into the air outside instead of returning the inside,4
136576.0,i think this because if she puts the shiny part outward then when the sun hits it it will reflect the sun thus causing no sun to heat the car and if she were toput the non shiny part outward it would get hot because there is not something shiny to reflect it of the car,4
150148.0,itll bonce off the heat,3
118294.0,the sunlight will be reflected before the heat gets inside the car,4
150057.0,i chose out of the car because then the heat would bounce off the sun shade and outside the car,3
153835.0,the shiny side will reflect the heat out of the car instead of inside the car so the heat won t go into the car it will reflect out of the car,3
118551.0,i think that it should face outside because it will reflect off of it,3
154339.0,because that way it will protect it from the sun,3
118445.0,i would shine the sun shade out of the car because it would deflect the heat and if i would turn it in towards the car it would magnify the heat in the car like a magnifying glass,2
118535.0,if the shiny part was facing out the sun will bounce off of the sun shade and not onto the car,3
151188.0,if it is facing the inside it might start a fire,2
136394.0,i would have the the shiny part face out of the car because it would attract less heat and have it bounce off,2
154847.0,the shiny part should face outward because it is like foil and deflects the sunlight as well as it s heat,4
154302.0,you should have it face the outside of the car because that s where the heat is coming from,2
150240.0,she should face the shiny part outwards because then the sun s rays don t go into the car but bounce off of the shiny mirror like shade,4
118561.0,if the shiny part is aiming toward the inside of the car it will reflect the heat inside the car if the shiny side aims towards the outside the car it will reflect the heat out of the car,4
118622.0,the shiny part is like a mirror therefor it would reflect heat i also see that in other s cars very often,3
136405.0,i would put these on the outside of the car because it would reflect the sun and not make the car hot if you these on the inside of the car the heat would have already got into the car and the car would be hotter,4
118315.0,if laura were to face the shiny part toward the inside of the car it would be the perfect solar oven so laura would have to face the shiny part away from the car so that it doesn t happen,4
139545.0,out of the car because it will reflect the heat radiation back outside instead of being inside,4
154204.0,it should face the outside out of the car because then the car will stay cool then facing the shiny part on the inside because the car because the the car will gt hotter if the shiny part is inside the car,2
153836.0,the more reflective side reflects solar rays better than the other side she does not want heat into the car so having the reflective side would work best to keep out heat and solar rays,4
139536.0,the light would be reflected away from the car which reflects the heat,4
149955.0,i chose this because the heat will just bounce off,3
150156.0,jvjksa,1
136468.0,laura should put it facing the other direction because if she puts in face towards the car the cor wont be nice and cool its going to be burning hot,2
149972.0,the shininess will keep heat from entering while the dull side will let heat out,2
153981.0,the shiny part is used like the tinfoil in our solar ovens the sun rays will bounce off of the shiny surface keeping the car cool another example is when you want a sun tan some people use that kind of material and angle it towards themselves because the sun rays bounce off of it,4
153982.0,with shinny things the heat goes on it and then bounces off just like the solar oven,3
118626.0,i think that because if the shiny part faces the inside it will make it more hot and if it faces the outside it will make it less hot in the car,2
136422.0,i think toward the inside of the car because you could put in the car on the windshield so the sun will reflect off the shiny side,4
136514.0,i chose to have the shiny tinfoil looking part of the sun shade to face outside the car because if it is used to keep the sun from making the car hot since it is called a sun shade i thought that the shiny part of the sun shade is supposed to make it so that the sun will reflect off the tinfoil making it so that the car does not get hot inside while the shiny part of the sun shade reflects the heat and sunlight,4
153979.0,because it is shine so the sun will reflect of the shine,4
136566.0,the heat outside will be reflected by the shiny part back outside,3
153997.0,you should put it on the outside of your car because if you do not the will want to go towards it,2
150083.0,it would be facing the outside of the car because the sun will go off the car if it s hitting the shiny part,3
118578.0,toward the inside of the car so the sunlight bouncing off the window wont reach the inside of the car as much,3
118536.0,if it is facing outside the heat will be stored,2
154115.0,it should face outside of the car so that the heat that goes towards the car gets reflected away by the shinny side,3
118529.0,i think that it should go out of the car because the sun will shine and reflect back,4
150237.0,so the shiny deflects the heat outside not inside,3
139528.0,the shiny side will have a better chance of reflecting heat away from the car,3
136502.0,out of the car because the shiny is light so it will reflect the heat,3
150145.0,it will not let it get more light,3
154196.0,i choice this because if it is in the car facing in the car will take the heat of the sun,3
150246.0,out of the car so it can reflect off,3
118358.0,because the heat will just reflect right of the car,3
118515.0,i think it should face the outside because it would probably just reflect off because it is shiny,3
118513.0,using it out of the car it will absorb the heat rather then the car,2
118367.0,because if you put it outside the sun can make the shade hot and the sun would come through it,3
118353.0,it should be out of the car so that the sun can reflecked out,4
136461.0,the light would be being absorbed into the shades of the car and not being absorbed into the inside of the car,3
118488.0,it should face this way because if it faces the other way the sun will reflect on it making it hot on the inside,4
154156.0,because inside is blocking the sun heat and won t get in the heat,2
118476.0,it should face the inside of the car cause it has to observe the suns heat,2
150159.0,its reflecting the sun,4
118352.0,the shiny part should be outside because it will abosrb the heat,2
149964.0,she should put it toward the inside because it will matter were the sun will hit the car,3
150219.0,the shiny part should face outwards because it will reflect the sun heat,4
139802.0,the shiny part should out of the car,2
136362.0,if it is facing out it will reflect and not come into the car if it is facing the inside all the sun s heat will shine in,2
153852.0,outside of the car because it will reflect the bright light back,4
154312.0,every thing reflecs back from something shiny,3
118463.0,because the shiny part of the sun shade will reflect the the light of the sun and keep the car cool,4
136368.0,i think it should face outside of the car so the heat will reflect off the sun shade so the heat won t stay inside of the car,3
136377.0,i think it will refkect and not attract light making it reflect and not have heat inside the car,4
151212.0,i chose this answer because if the sun protection was inside the car on part of the car would be shiny which is the outside the part of the sun protection that s behind the sun would be dark and not shiny like the part of the sun protection that s shiny from the reflection of the sun,4
118312.0,it should face out of the car because the shiny part will make it warm,2
150119.0,the sun shade should face the outside of the car because so the goes away from the car and not in the car,3
118530.0,because if she do that the light is not going into the car because is like a tin foil,4
118458.0,the light reflecting of the shiny side will go into the car and heat it from the glare if place towards the inside of the car,4
150244.0,so the heat reflects back out and not back in,3
136508.0,i chose out of the car because the sun shade when its out side the glass won t get too hot not even a little but if you put it outside the sun will get the mirrors and the glass too hoeand the car too it won t cover it all,2
118344.0,i chose the inside of the car cause some one can steal it and your car will get really really hot,2
118302.0,the shiny part of the sun shade should go on the outside of the car because the shiny part reflexes the solar heat coming into the car when laura is outside on a summer day,2
154121.0,if you put those wind shields inside the car it will block the sun from the inside of the car,3
118598.0,the shiny part should face away from the car because it reflects the sunlight from the car,4
150053.0,if the shiny part is facing the sun the sun will bounce off instead of being attracted to the the non shiny side,3
118548.0,i think the shiny part should stay in because if the shiny part is out the sun can reflect on it,4
136570.0,she would want to face the shiny side out of the car because when the solar and uv rays shine onto it then they would just get reflected back if you face the non shiny side of the sun shade the the rays will most likely get absorbed,5
150090.0,so the heat reflcts off of it back to the sky so it doesnt get in your car and stays away from your car,3
136399.0,if the shiny part is facing it will heat up the car and the sun shades will be use less,2
118578.0,you do not want the sun reflecting on to you so clearly the best idea would be to have the shiny side facing the outside of the car,4
139880.0,out of the car because it will avoid the sun rays to come inside the car,3
136504.0,i think that she should choose the windshield because it will reflect it is just like the tin foil so it will not make it hotter then the inside,3
139828.0,the shiny part so be outside so it can be reflected out and the light does not get absorbed into the car,5
136564.0,i think the shiny part should face outside because it has a higher albedo so it would reflect the heat,3
136372.0,she should aim the sun shade facing out of the car because if it was facing the inside of the car the heat would reflect into the car,3
118556.0,i think that because the tinfoil thing will deflect the sun and go away,3
118313.0,shiny fabric absorbs more sunlight than the dull colored fabric,3
139831.0,the shiny part should face the outside of the car because it can easily deflect the light more than the dull side,4
118550.0,reflects light out,4
139876.0,the sun shade should face out of the car so that the heat would bounce back,2
118410.0,it wont atrack heat,2
118514.0,i f the shiny shade is facing the outside of the car it will reflect sunlight back out of the car instead of letting it get absorbed by the windshield or the dark side of the sunshade,5
118348.0,outside of the car because the shinny part reflects,3
118533.0,so the light heat can reflect off,4
150162.0,put it outside so that it will bounce the sun rase off of the shiny part and back outside and not heat up the car as much,4
150165.0,inside of the car because then it wont attract the sun as much it will block the sun from coming inside,3
136475.0,you should put it inside the car because the sun does not comes in the car and it keeps it cooler,3
139488.0,i chose outside of the car so that maybe the shiny part of the sun shade can reflect some heat rays coming from the sun,2
139877.0,the shiny part of the the sun shade would reflect the sun rays away from the car,4
153818.0,the shiny side of the sunshade reflects more radiation from the sun so it cant be absorbed and turned into heat,5
150076.0,i am not sure for this question but i think the shiny part of her windshield should be facing inside the car i thought of these questions while i was thinking about it can it attract heat too if people walk past my car the shiny part can hurt their eyes,2
136366.0,because if it s hanging out someone might steel it or it might leave an oping to sunlight can get in your car and if you put it inside you can see where it is,2
150061.0,i said out the car because the shiny part will reflect the sun and heat,4
150127.0,the shiney side will mostly take all of the attracted light and bounce it back away from the car,4
150242.0,the shiny side will send heat away because it is a bright color so she should take the shiny side and make it face outside of her car,2
139850.0,the shiny side will reflect heat and light back causing it not to heat up,4
150149.0,if the sun shade is dark gray and shiny i would put it on the inside because sun also gives off more heat to something shining to the sun,2
150923.0,it will feel hot,2
118393.0,the shiny part should be on the out side because it will reflecit the sun and not obsorb the heat from the sun,5
136683.0,be case if it was on the out siyd it would refleckt and the athre one would adsorb all the sun be case it would not get in,4
139790.0,to bounce back the light because the shiny part is reflective to light,4
136408.0,it should face the outside of the car because it ll reflect the uv rays,3
139533.0,the shiny part is used to reflect the rays of the sun so that the rays don t go inside of the car and make it hot,4
155700.0,i think the shiny part is for drawing in the sun so making it face the outside of the car will make the car hot,3
141559.0,well sinse the shiny part is way more reflective you should put it on the out side not the inside because if you put it on the out side it reflects all the heat out side now if you were to put it on the inside all the heat from the inside will try to escape but it cant because of the reflectivity,3
136413.0,you want to make sure the heat is reflected away from the car and it does not get trapped inside,3
136452.0,i have seen cars use sun shades and it s facing out of the car,2
139796.0,you do not want the sunlight to reflect in he car because you are trying to keep the car cool,4
149954.0,so the light reflects the back,4
139798.0,this way the sun s heat will bounce off the car,2
118560.0,it shold be inside,2
153834.0,the shiny part will reflect the heat out keeping the car cool,3
153837.0,toward the out of the car because then the sun can reflect off something,4
150058.0,she sod do the sun saed on the inside becase the heat will not git in,2
118361.0,i think it is toward the inside of the car because it is stoping the light sides and the front window as will,3
154317.0,it should face out for the beams will shoot back because its shiny,3
153915.0,so then the shiny part wont reflect of the glass,3
149950.0,because if the dark side is facing out the son goes into it,2
153837.0,outside of the car so the heat can reflect off the shade into the atmosphere also because the car wouldn t heat up as much,3
154201.0,the sun will not affect the car and everything inside so it won t heat up fast,3
118457.0,inside the car so the solar radiation will not get in the car,3
154201.0,i picked this answer because the hat won t be attracted to the car,2
153992.0,cause it will make the thing hot,2
118416.0,she should put them out of the car because then it would keep the sun out,2
154218.0,so the sun doesn t reflect into the car and if the shades are there then the sun wont go into the car,4
118398.0,out of the car because it will reflict and it will have the car cool,3
154214.0,because it will reflect heat and not absorb it,4
118460.0,toward the car because if you put the shiny part toward outside you can attract even more sunlight,3
118519.0,because it will keep the inside cooled down and not in the outside,2
118551.0,it should face outside because we want the sun reflecting off of reflector rather than having the sun warm the inside of the car,5
150054.0,the shiny thing can support the bouncing heat,3
136397.0,it should face towards the out side of the car because that way they part the shily part is more thicker,2
136459.0,if she wants the cover to block it she s going to need to face the shiny part away so the sun moves away from it,2
118306.0,i think laura might want to make the shine part face the out side because it will riflect the sun back out,4
150199.0,if it is inside the car some sun will enter the car so when laura enters her car it will be hot,3
136373.0,if you put that on the outside of the car it would get hot and if you put it inside it would be easy and the sun wont make it warm in the car and it will protect it from the sun,2
139831.0,the shiny part should face the outside of the car because it better reflects heat than the non shiny side keeping the car cool,3
154139.0,ichose inside the car because if it was out side it would not work because the fabric on the outside would just absorb the heat and the car would be hot and the fabric wont save it from getting hot,3
154133.0,why these fabrics should be in the outside because it is better so that different kind of fabrics should be covering the car from the outside so that it will help the car not get heated up,2
150140.0,it could block the inside of the car so it won t get heated up when laura comes back,2
150918.0,i chose this answer because usually people put their shiny part of their shields towards the inside of the car because shiny things always attract the sun because of how it reflects and glints in the sky,4
150094.0,the shade will reflect the sun,4
154325.0,if you faced the shiny side to the person the non shiny part will just absorb the sunlight thus making it hot if you made the shiny part face the sun it will deflect the light and make the light face another way this way it does not heat up the car,5
150106.0,if it is out of the car the inside of the car would heat up if you put it inside it would be cold inside of the radiotion,3
136501.0,this is because the shiny part will reflect the heat so it will not go in the car if the shiny part faced inside of the car the heat would be drawn in and would have trouble leaving,3
118586.0,laura wants her car not to be sunny so the car should face out of the car,3
154131.0,the shine would reflect the heat outward so it does,3
150194.0,because the shiny part would deflect the suns rays off of her wind shield,4
118367.0,because if u use the shade out of the car the car will be hot,2
149972.0,that will keep most heat from entering and let heat that has entered escape,2
118309.0,because its the inside your trying to keep it cold not outside,2
118438.0,the shine of the sun shade will attract the sun and make her car hot if she left the shiny part facing the outside of the car if she wants to keep it normal temperature she should face the shiny part on the inside of the car,3
118368.0,out the car,2
118594.0,because the car from inside needs it more because laura needs something to keep her car cool,2
150116.0,the sun shade will keep less heat from coming in the car it will bounce of of the car and outside of it,3
118445.0,the shiny side would point the heat outside of the car not heating it,2
136391.0,i chose b because the shiny part of the windshield will act has a reflecter andreflect the heat light away from the car,4
118406.0,the shiny side should be outside the car because if its inside the window well take in the heat and push it inside the car but if its outside it will block the heat before it touches the window,2
139790.0,the shiny part bounces off more colors which means that it bounces off more heat,3
118321.0,because if you towards the car it will attract a lot of solar radiation and if you put it out the car it won t attract no solar radiation,3
118310.0,i think the sun shade should face out of the car so the shiny part makes the sun not hit the car,3
154302.0,it should face the outside of the car because it will keep the heat out,2
154195.0,i think the reflector should face out of the car because it will reflect the heat energy away from the car s windshield,4
150231.0,so no heat will get in,2
150125.0,you should put the shiny part on the outside because the heat will reflect of it and won t come in the car kind of like a shield,3
153999.0,the shiny part keeps the heat so your car does not get hot,2
118469.0,then the heat reflects away,3
118337.0,i chose my answer because the shiny part is like a mirror and mirrors reflect and you would want to reflct the sun out of the car,4
154155.0,it blocks the the heat rays of the car,3
150239.0,so all the heat deflects away from the car not at the car,3
118353.0,if the shiny part is facing the outside of the car it is a reflection so the sun will come in and go out of the car,4
153848.0,i think it is out of the car because if she has it on the non shiny part facing out then it will attract more heat so it is better to have it on the shiny side facing up you want the shiny side facing up like who would want more heat in their car you always want to stay cool,2
154160.0,because it makes it colder,2
149950.0,the sun protector should have the shiny part out because it reflects heat,4
154308.0,the reflection should face outside because the light heat will reflect outward,4
150131.0,the shiny part is foil foil can make the heat waves bounce of something in what foil is made of does that,3
154303.0,i think the sunshade should face toward the outside of the car because since that part is shiny it s reflective as well which should reflect the heat she should not use the other side because since that side is not reflective it would get absorbed by the heat as well as the sunshade is a dark color,4
136450.0,the reflective part of the shade will reflect the heat and light back to the world,4
153831.0,out because then it will deflect the heat rays,3
136403.0,it should face toward the inside of the car because if it was facing outside then the sun would reflect off of it making the car hot,2
139833.0,the shiny material will be able to help reflect sunlight and keep the waves from getting inside and heating up the car,4
136417.0,you want it toward the inside of the car not the out because if put the outside it will catch on fire because of the brightness of it but if you put the one that is not shiny then it won t catch on fire,2
153854.0,so then the heat will bounce on and off of the car then the car wont get to hot,3
153912.0,radiation,2
154345.0,so inside the car does not get heat but the outside get some heat ad it might blow away when it outside,2
139543.0,this is because reflective material reflects sunlight meaning less heat,4
139544.0,the shiny part would face out of the car because the purpose of the sun shade is to block all the heat from the sun from entering the car if the shiny part were to face out of the car that way the light rays would be reflected back out of the car if it was toward the inside of the car the heat would travel inside the car and get trapped because the heat cannot escape since it is being reflected back into the car,2
150169.0,so the heat can reflect off of it,3
150235.0,with the shiny part on the outside sunlight can bounce off it and away from her car,4
136454.0,the shinny should be outside so that it can reflect the heat from the outside,3
118438.0,there is no light on the inside of the car,3
136509.0,the one side of the sun shade is very shiny on shoud be in the car because shiny things deflct and that will make the windoiw very hot the other side is not shiny will be on the out side because noshiny things do not deflct,2
154226.0,if she does it in the out side of the car it s going to heat up and the car will become more hotter,2
139881.0,you want the shiny side to face out of the car so it will reflect the heat that is going inside the car,3
150053.0,if the shinny part is facing the sun then when then when the sun hits the window shield it will reflect off,4
