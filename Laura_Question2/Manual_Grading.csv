150106.0,if it is out of the car the inside of the car would heat up if you put it inside it would be cold inside of the radiotion,3
150069.0,this is my answer because picture is trying to keep the sun out so its kind of absorbing up all the sun that wants to get into the car,3
151207.0,so the sun rays will bounce of the the shiny part of the sun shade,4
154329.0,toward inside the car because then if the sun hits the shiny part it will be hot when you touch it,3
118597.0,she needs to put the shinny part outside so it dose not get hot,2
118298.0,i pick toward the inside of the car because it will make the outside hot but not the inside,2
150062.0,it should reflect on the outside of the car because when the heat goes through the glass the heat will just reflect back towards the sunlight,3
139545.0,having it reflect out of the car will redirect the sun toward a different direction,4
118545.0,it should face out because it will reflect more heat than if you put it inside the car,3
118462.0,i think toward the outside of the car because then the sun will catch on the shiny part and reflect away from the car,4
118348.0,outside of the car because the shinny part reflects,3
118396.0,it should face the out side becuse it wont obser inside the car,2
154337.0,the part that laura would like is that her car is not that hot when she gets her car back if he protects the car from the inside than it will not heat up has much the outside of the car is going to be hot but the inside is not if it is protected by the shield,2
118297.0,so the refelects and hits something else,3
149971.0,cuz i said,1
154353.0,so she can still see well she is diving and it will be cooler,2
154334.0,you put the reflected side on the out side becouse the sun would heat the car up hot,3
150143.0,this is because the sun will repell off of it,4
154127.0,i chose this because if the shiny part faces out of the car it will repel the sunlight,3
139525.0,the shiny fabric should face outside of the car because the solar radiation will bounce from the shiny fabric i m back into the air outside instead of returning the inside,4
151200.0,it faces the outside because it shades the car so it does not make sense for the hotter side to be facing the inside of the car and it will just warm the car up if the shady part of the shade is facing the outside,2
139494.0,the shiny part would be outside so it the sunlight can be reflected out and heat stays outside the car,4
136363.0,the shiny part will deflect the sun,4
153921.0,out of the car because then the heat will get into your car but the shinny part will protect the inside,2
139834.0,this means it has reflective tendencies and reflecting sunlight will not heat up your car,4
118565.0,you will choose the second choice because it will just reflect the heat energy,4
154915.0,it should face out of the car so the radiation hits the sun shade and bounces away,4
150221.0,so the sun goes away,3
136413.0,you want to make sure the heat is reflected away from the car and it does not get trapped inside,3
150109.0,the shiney part should be in the outside part because the shiney part of the object will reflect,3
118540.0,you should put the shiny part on the outside because the shiny part will reflect the heat hitting the sunlight away from the car,4
153982.0,i would put them in the outside because the heat will bounce off of the silver one,3
153928.0,out the car because the sun rays has to reflect on something back out if you put the dark side facing out the sun rays wont reflect but it will probably get absorbed,5
150220.0,the shiny part will keep the radiation from going into the car and warming it up,4
150127.0,the shiney side will mostly take all of the attracted light and bounce it back away from the car,4
136422.0,i think toward the inside of the car because you could put in the car on the windshield so the sun will reflect off the shiny side,4
150119.0,the sun shade should face the outside of the car because so the goes away from the car and not in the car,3
139867.0,the shiny side would retract the sun off of the car which would make the car cooler,3
136576.0,i say that lauren should put the shiny part facing outward of the car because if it s really shiny it will reflect all the sun of and out of her car because one it doesn t have a dark color or a light color so it doesn t attract or reflect and detrack it will just reflect off of it so the car won t get hot,2
149588.0,out of the car because if the shiny part is inside then it will go through the fabric and will get the car hotter,3
118396.0,put it toward the window,2
136477.0,i put toward the inside of the car because if it was the out of the car it could reflect in to the car,2
154328.0,the shiny one looks like a window sized windshield,2
150077.0,when heat reflects on something shiny the heat will bounce off of the material and not be as hot,3
153834.0,the shiny part will reflect the heat out keeping the car cool,3
136463.0,the shiny part should face the outside so it can reflect the heat back out,3
118477.0,i chose toward the outside because the silver has a reflection on it if you turn it outside the sun is going to hit your car but its going to face somewhere else instead of your car because you put it outside,4
118583.0,so it does not reaflect into the car,3
153994.0,shiny things get hot quite quickely if you look at a shiny thing in the sun it is very bright it is attrackting sun and heating it up thats why you should put the shiny part facing the inside of the car,2
150202.0,she should use it on the inside to the outside doesn t burn,2
136683.0,be case if it was on the out siyd it would refleckt and the athre one would adsorb all the sun be case it would not get in,4
118600.0,it will reflect the heat and light,4
154329.0,outside so the heat does not reflect in side the car,3
118521.0,she should put the shiny part facing the inside of the car because if she put it toward the outside of the car the heat would be absorbed into the metal,2
150124.0,the shiny part should be facing the sun to reflect the heat,3
150090.0,because then the sun reflects away from the car,4
154312.0,toward the outside so then it would reflect the heat back out,3
136501.0,that is because the shiny side would reflect the heat from the window of the car instead of letting it through like the not shiny side would,3
154133.0,why these fabrics should be in the outside because it is better so that different kind of fabrics should be covering the car from the outside so that it will help the car not get heated up,2
153930.0,it would face out so the sun reflects off it and it does not make the car hot,4
136423.0,it should face outside the car so it can deflect the sun s rays away from the car keeping it cool,4
136402.0,then the heat won t hit the car at all because the windshield will be blocking the heat,2
118591.0,it should be out of the car so it gets the suns energy,3
153982.0,with shinny things the heat goes on it and then bounces off just like the solar oven,3
139520.0,pointing the sun shade towards the outside because the material of the sunshade reflects light and heat energy so if you point the sunshade outside of the car it ll reflect the heat away from the car,4
139869.0,so it keeps cooler and warmer,2
136467.0,i chose out of the car because the sunlight would bounce off the shiny side preventing it from getting inside the car so there would be less heat,4
139808.0,i think the skinny part should go on the inside and the thick side should go on the outside of the car window too have the thick part twords the sun,2
118598.0,it should be facing out of the car because if it s facing towards the car it ll heat the car up,2
150153.0,the shininess of the visor directs the heat away from the car,3
118369.0,so the energy of the sun can bounce of the car and in that way give it shade,3
118548.0,i think the shiny part should stay in because if the shiny part is out the sun can reflect on it,4
118578.0,you do not want the sun reflecting on to you so clearly the best idea would be to have the shiny side facing the outside of the car,4
139870.0,you will want the shiny part of the shade facing the sun because the shiny more reflective part will reflect the heat way from the car keeping the interior cool,4
154322.0,i am not for sure but maybe if it is against the sun the heat will bounce back,4
118560.0,it shold be inside,2
150915.0,you don t want to put it outside because you don t want it to be stolen,2
118358.0,because the heat will just reflect right of the car,3
153863.0,if it is reflecting the outside of the car it will have the sunlight go in a different direction,4
118563.0,i said outside because the shiny part absorbs the heat and un shiny keeps out the heat,2
151216.0,if you face it inside you car will just get hotter,2
118480.0,then it can reflect the sun off the car and it wont be hot inside the car,4
136377.0,i think it will refkect and not attract light making it reflect and not have heat inside the car,4
118452.0,i think that it should point twords the outside of the car because it deflects the sun,3
150135.0,i chose towared the in side the car because you will get less heat,2
118620.0,so it dosn t get hot and reflection will get it hot,2
149969.0,so it does not soak up heat if the darkside was facing the sun then it would get hot,2
136460.0,the shiny side will reflect the heat out of the car if laura were to put the dull side facing out the heat wouldn t be reflect that well if at all the shiny side will do much better at reflecting heat out and keeping her car cool,3
136411.0,because you want the sun to hit the shine part and bounce right off and that will keep the car coller,4
154343.0,the foil type matirial refects the radiation and keeps the car from getting to hot inside,4
139831.0,the shiny part should face the outside of the car because it can easily deflect the light more than the dull side,4
136566.0,the heat outside will be reflected by the shiny part back outside,3
150195.0,it should face the outside of the car because the shiny side is like a mirror and reflects the sun,4
150231.0,so the shade dosent get hot and burn up,2
153993.0,because the shiny part bounces of the sun,4
139863.0,using the shiny part pointing away from the car the heat can be reflected off of the car and pointed toward another direction,3
153831.0,because the heat will reflect out and will not let the heat in,3
150056.0,the shiny part will take the suns heat and reflect it out of the car the non shiny part won t do that,4
139840.0,so that when the light hits the shield it will reflect back,4
118476.0,it should face the inside of the car cause it has to observe the suns heat,2
150918.0,i chose this answer because usually people put their shiny part of their shields towards the inside of the car because shiny things always attract the sun because of how it reflects and glints in the sky,4
150085.0,i chose my answer because the shiny side will reflect the heat away from the car making it less hot,3
118537.0,i think it should face out of the car because it will allow the sun to reflect it somewhere else,4
151179.0,i think it should go toward the inside of the car because then the shiney part won t be facing out because the shiner it is the hotter it will become,2
150206.0,so it blokes the sun in the inside,3
153912.0,radiation,2
118592.0,it will not let the suns heat get aborbed inside the car it will make the suns heat point to another diction,2
139811.0,you need it to reflect towards the outside of the car because you dont want to trap the heat inside of the car,3
154137.0,laura s sun shade that is on her windshield it would go inside because the sun shade is covering the inside so the sun wouldn t beam inside the car,3
151226.0,because when you put it in the car it gets hotter if you put it on the outside it you can block the sun better and it affects more,3
118511.0,i think this answer because it makes the car hotter if you put the shiny side out it will jut make the car hotter well that s just my upinion,2
118558.0,it should be outside of the car because if you put it inside of the car there is nothing covering the front window,2
150082.0,if you put the shiny part toward the outside of the car the heat will bounce of,3
154318.0,because i just think that and it is hard to explain,1
154000.0,so sun can t get in as well,3
139544.0,the shiny part should face out of the car because you want the light to reflect away from the car if the reflective part were to face the inside of the car heat is allowed into the car and it is reflected back and there is no where for the heat to escape,4
139827.0,so that it reflects out of the car,3
153864.0,you should put the shiny part toward the outside of the car because you want the sun rays to bounce away from the car instead of inside the car,4
139881.0,you want the shiny side to face out of the car so it will reflect the heat that is going inside the car,3
118438.0,there is no light on the inside of the car,3
139831.0,the shiny part should face the outside of the car because it better reflects heat than the non shiny side keeping the car cool,3
118586.0,because you want to use the sun shade,2
118619.0,so they don t heat the inside of the car,2
136498.0,the shiny part would face out of the car because it will reflect the heat that comes toward to make it hotter,3
150198.0,i think mainly because it wont be blocking the cars as much,2
154120.0,if laura wanted the inside of the car to stay cool then she would need to put the sun shade towards the inside of the car to stay cool if we faced the sun shades out of the car i think that the car s temperature would be warmer than the outside air,2
150074.0,so that heat does not get absorbed into the dark side and heat in the car will be absorbed from the other side being put to the outside of the car,3
139849.0,if the shiny part faces the inside of the car then it will heat up the car faster,2
118602.0,i chose out of the because the sun would reaflect of of the shiny part and not heat up the car,4
136553.0,because when it is shiny then that mean it is reflecting,3
150139.0,i chose this because when the heat tries to go inside of the car it the shiny one when will just reflect the heat the other way,3
136572.0,because the shiny part will absorb the sunlight,2
150217.0,i think that she put the sun shade out of her car because the heat will reflect outside of the car instead of inside it,3
118586.0,laura wants her car not to be sunny so the car should face out of the car,3
136416.0,so it reflects out her window instead of off the window so creating less heat for the car to take,3
118587.0,l think the windsheld should go on the outside because thats how it s suposed to go,2
154199.0,out of the car because the shiny side will reflect the heat and sun off,4
150194.0,because the shiny part would deflect the suns rays off of her wind shield,4
154155.0,it will reflect the uv rays off the car,4
154194.0,the shiny part of the shade will not absorb the energy but will reflect it making it bounce off and out of the car the other side will absorb the energy and will let the energy through this is why you would put the shiny side to the outside and not inside,5
150090.0,so the heat reflcts off of it back to the sky so it doesnt get in your car and stays away from your car,3
118416.0,she should put them out of the car because then it would keep the sun out,2
151210.0,nose,1
150137.0,well since it is shiny it will just reflect the radiation back outside but if you put it on the inside it will not let as much get in but it still will push though,4
118543.0,it should face out of the car because the heat will reflect because its like the color of metal and metal reflects so that s why i think that,3
150155.0,well they are going to reflect heat and unless you want your car to get very very hot then i suggest that you but them on the outside to reflect away from the car,3
141561.0,if you have the shiny part outside it will reflect because the other said is not light colored and then you have less heat because it is reflecting the heat out,3
153854.0,so then the heat will bounce on and off of the car then the car wont get to hot,3
139768.0,the sun will bounce off the shine and keep it out the car,4
154108.0,i chose that the shiny part should face the outside of the car because when the sun rays hit the sun shade the shine will reflect the rays back,4
118450.0,i think the shiny part should face the inside so the shiny part won t reflect the heat back onto the car and make the car hotter,2
118321.0,out the car because if put the sun shade toward the car the car will get hot and if you put the sun shade out the car the sun will reflect of the car and it could stay cool in the inside,4
153864.0,it should face outside the car because that is the side where it shines light away,3
139538.0,the shiny part will absorb a lot of the heat that is directed into the car and i see people do this a lot,2
136381.0,i think the shiny part should face outside because it will reflect the sun i know because some people have the shiny ones and i get blinded,4
149965.0,the shiny part will reflect the heat towards the sun,3
136388.0,i think it should face the outside because the shiny side will most likely reflect the light and it s colors,4
154217.0,so your seats wont get hot and it will be a little cold but not alot of it just a little,2
118628.0,when you put it on the inside it stops the sun from bleaching the inside but when it is on the outside the sun could eat the material,3
154160.0,because it makes it colder,2
153916.0,so the sunlight reflects off of it,4
149962.0,pointing to the outside of the car can block the sun,3
154142.0,toward the out side of the car because then it won t make heat,2
153923.0,i think it should be going out because than the radiation will bounce out,4
118361.0,i think it is toward the inside of the car because it is stoping the light sides and the front window as will,3
154143.0,because the the out side car is hot and it has tinfoil and when it up it can get on fire,2
139515.0,the shiny part should face out of the car because the shiny part of the sun shade is more efficient at reflecting radiation than the not shiny side,4
118405.0,it should face the out side of the car because then it obsores the sun light on the shinny side and it wont heat the car but if you put the shinny side facing the inside of the car it will heat the inside of the car,3
118413.0,the out side of the car because when the sun hits the shiny part of the sun shade the sun will bounce right off of the sun shade and go back tored the sun,3
150243.0,it should face away from the car because it acts like a reflector making the sun s heat go away,4
136405.0,i think this because the light from the shield is shiny witch can make the sun reclect off the shield and back into space or somewear else,4
139490.0,the shiny part of the sun shade should be facing the outside because this way the light is reflected back towards the atmosphere,4
150158.0,because someone could take it or the wind could push it away,2
154307.0,i think it s best to put it on the inside of he car because then the sun shade will make the inside cool,2
153993.0,the shiny part should face the outside so the sun bounces of the car,4
136570.0,she would want to face the shiny side out of the car because when the solar and uv rays shine onto it then they would just get reflected back if you face the non shiny side of the sun shade the the rays will most likely get absorbed,5
150226.0,i say out of the car because it will reflect the heat,3
136399.0,the shinny side is not going to let the heat inside,2
136411.0,you want the shinny part facing the out side of the car to reflect the heat back out and not make the car so warm,3
139871.0,the shiny part of the sun shade should face on the outside of the car so the heat reflects and bounces out the car instead of towards the car,3
150167.0,so the suns rays can bounce off the car,4
153913.0,so the heat can bounce of the car and not inside,3
150092.0,it will reflect not move,3
136505.0,the part of the windshield that is shiny should be facing outside becuas ethat way the light would be reflected of the car and not be absorbed into it,5
150137.0,i chose on the outside of car because i think that having the shiny part on the outside it will deflect the sun s radiation,4
149971.0,so it won t get hot inside,2
136522.0,laura does not want her car to be hot so she wants the hot solar radiation to be directed outside of her car not inward,4
154204.0,it should face the outside out of the car because then the car will stay cool then facing the shiny part on the inside because the car because the the car will gt hotter if the shiny part is inside the car,2
153987.0,bc less heat will come in the car,2
118393.0,the reason the shiny part should be out of the car because it will reflect the sun and it won t take in the heat of the sun also if the side that is not shiny it will take in the warmness of the sun which will make it even hotter,4
136462.0,it will be inside because the sun rays will reflict the shiny shade that will not let the inside of the car hot but the outside window is hot,4
136485.0,because if you put that in front of the car it prevents the sun to make your car from the inside to not get very warm or hot also because when the sun is getting your car very hot but you have the shiny shield on the front of your car it gives the sun a sign of not putting to much warmness inside your car,2
118345.0,the shiny part should face out because it will reflect the heat and the not shiny pat will obsorb it,3
154150.0,it protects,2
150064.0,if the shinny part wis in the window the shinny part will send the heat back up in the sky,2
136461.0,the light would be being absorbed into the shades of the car and not being absorbed into the inside of the car,3
136574.0,if it faces out of the car that means that s sending back the rays into the sky,3
153836.0,if it was facing out of the car the sun would atract to it and it would make the car hotter,3
136517.0,i think this because the shiny part will reflect and stop all the heat from getting in and the dull side will stop all the heat inside from being absorbed by absorbing the heat itself which is fine because it won be touched when she uses the car again,3
150199.0,if it is inside the car some sun will enter the car so when laura enters her car it will be hot,3
153996.0,i choose the very shinny side because the other side the air can go through,2
