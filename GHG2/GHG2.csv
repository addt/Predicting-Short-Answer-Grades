118296,"If the heat can't get out of the green glass, the atmosphere acts like the glass, because the picture shows that the sunlight can come into the atmosphere, but can't get out. 

Katie",5
118300,Because they look simalair.,2
118302,It is the Earth because a green house keeps the energy for the for escaping the the green house and the Earth keeps the air from escaping the Earth so it like a green house.,3
118310,i think the atmosphere because the is make the sun not escape the earth.,3
118304,"The heat from the sun gets trapped inside and when it tries to escape, it just bounces off.",2
118313,Earth also absorbs sunlight and the atmosphere keeps it from leaving.,4
118319,because the atmosphere serves as a window for earth it is the same thing but bigger.,3
118297,the earth because it is reflecting sun light.,3
118298,Because the sun passes through the atmosphere to earth just like the sun passing through the glass.,2
118311,because the atmosphere gathers gases and in the green house the glass is letting in heat.,2
118305,it is the earth because  picture b show that the earth has a glass that the green house is showing.,2
118293,The atmosphere acts like the glass because it lets the sun light go in but the sunlight can't get out.,4
118299,Well the sun is mostly going to be heating glass because it reflects to light so its most common for the sun to hit glass,2
118309,because in the picture i see that the earth is trapping the heat,2
118307,Because the atmosphere is what gives us gravity.,2
118306,i think that the sun will act like the grass and will provide nuterians for the plants ,2
118308,Because you need water for a green house and earth has lots of lakes and oceans,2
118321,The sun because of its reflection.,2
118312,I think space because things go through space like the glass of the greenhouse.,2
118318,"the sun shines on earth and it get big and closer every year,That is why every year 
it gets really hot when is is hot the homes of people are heated up and it is really hot. If there is a window on the roof the i will get even more hot because the sun shines an goes in even if there is a window.",2
118303,The sun came in the atmosphere and the heat from the earth is trapped in the earth's atmosphere.  ,3
118314,yes the windows,2
118301,I think it is the atmosphere because the sun shines through the glass and the atmosphere.,2
118316,it shows the sun because it shows the sun shining in different places.,2
118320,The sun because there was heat flares coming up through the windows of the greenhouse.,2
118294,0,1
118315,globle warming is when heat can not escape our atmosphere making our earth hot almost like a green house but instead of a atmosphere we have a glass for the heating ,3
118323,On picture (a) it shows you how the glas keeps the heat in well it works the same way with the earth.,3
118482,0,1
118478,Green house gas collects up in the atmosphere and creates the glodel warming,2
118479,earth because there is no windows in other planets,2
118480,It is like the atmosphere because its becoming really hot when the sun reflects on it and then it gets through to the earth.,2
118473,because the sun is heating the plants ,2
118474,hclbjmdbkgvmtihbkvjtyue8oorhygtfjmiuk,1
118483,0,1
118470,The sun passes through the atmosphere onto the earth's surface.,2
118472,0,1
118468,The atmosphere makes it so the heat cannot escape and it makes it so it deflects the heat so it 'bounces' back to the Earth.,3
118475,It contains the warmth and rebounds the contained energy.,2
118477,I chose earth because the sun is obviously hitting earth which is what is happening in the green house its just hitting the inside because of the mirrors on the roof.,2
118465,"The glass and the atmosphere both let light and heat in.





",3
118487,in the picture the sun is not going through the atmosphere and the sun is not going through the glass of the green house,2
118488,?,1
118486,I chose that because its like the greenhouse it goes in it and it can't escape.,2
118484,0,1
118485,0,1
118490,the atmosphere because in the picture above it shows  that the reflection of the sun goes in the atmosphere and reflects back down,2
118467,The sun is like the grass of the greenhouse because the sun can go anywhere in the house.,2
118471,The atmosphere is keeping heat and energy from escaping to space.,3
118469,0,1
118466,"in the picture the sun goes through the glass, the sun also goes through the atmosphere.",2
118543,the atmosphere looks like it has glass,2
118515,it might be ,1
118517,"Earth because the sun hits the earth and dosn't escape after it hits the earth.
",2
118533,"because the long chain molecules like carbon dioxide, and methanes reflect the ultra violet light back at earth which traps the heat in our atmosphere",2
118518,"The atmostsphere is what is keeping the air in and the space out, and a green house does the same thing.",2
118548,I think the sun is like the glass in the greenhouse because the sun can reflect of the glass in the greenhouse and it can reflect on the earth.,2
118522,the atmosphere because it makes it bounce back,2
118562,the sun is shining on it,2
118526,I know this because the sun light is hitting the earth.,3
118567,"the atmosphere is like the glass because the heat can go in, but not out.",2
118516,I think that it is atmosphere because it is like glass you can not go through it by your self. ,2
118521,0,1
118520,"Because it's going into the atmosphere,then Earth.",2
118514,"The atmosphere acts as the glass in the greenhouse, it allows heat to come in and lets less out.",2
118512,Both pictures the sunlight goes through the glass or atmosphere.,3
118509,Earth is like the greenhouse so the glass would be next.,2
118534,the sun reflects green but its not noticeable for the air.,2
118519, the sun  because in picture b it shows  the sun is shinning hard at the earth.,2
118511,I think this answer because the way the heat is bouncing of the earth looks like the glass from the greenhouse.,2
118542,the sun because the sun goes through the glass and shine light on the plants.,3
118537,I think that it is the sun because it allows it to get sunlight to grow.,2
118529,I think that is the atmosphere because it is like a layer that can reflect the sunlight to shine on earth.,3
118536,"like the glass, the picture shows that the atmosphere doesn't let any light go back into the surroundings.",3
118523,well becuse earth is getting heated up also,2
118530,"the sun because it is like a glass to the greenhouse, sun is energy and plants need energy to live and water too.So the greenhouse resives sunlight from the sun.",3
118510,The atmosphere doesn't let heat out into space like how the glass doesn't let heat out of the greenhouse.,3
118513,the atmosphere separates space and earth.,2
118556,The atmosphere because the glass keeps the heat in and the atmosphere stays into the earth.,3
118549,i think that it is the atmosphere because because it keeps the heat from escaping earth,3
118607,the atmosphere will let heat and light in but will not let it come out.,3
118622,0,1
118604,the atmose phere is closer than spase an also spae is dosent stop any thing,2
118614,i chose this answer because the sun is hot,2
118628,"The atmosphere allows the hot sun to hit a heat ray and warm the earth up, just like the glass allows the heat ray to shine on the plants so they can grow.",2
118632,0,1
118602,"
?????????????
",1
118600,It keeps the stuff inside.,2
118623,I picked earth because it is the space that contains the gas and space and the atmosphere doesn't contain it.,2
118613,because the sun beams through,2
118610,the sun's heat goes to earth then hit the earth but before that could happen it goes through the atmosphere.,2
118618,I chose the atmosphere because the glass and atmosphere lets hot air in and out but has the cold air stay in. ,2
118626,0,1
118621,0,1
118611,0,1
118606,its the part that the sun passes through,2
118620,because the atsmosphere block it.,2
118616,0,1
118601,The atmosphere surrounds the Earth so I thought this was a reasonable answer.,2
118615,Plants water and sun for it to grow.,2
118624,0,1
118634,0,1
118609,i cant,1
118612,the sun is reflexting the sun like the green house ,2
118947,0,1
118344,because it is the atmosphere cause after the at atmosphere is the space and out of the green house is the air,2
118337,0,1
118358,Because heat can not escape the Earth.,2
118350,"The atmosphere lets in the sunlight but then when the sunlight hits the Earth, the Earth obsorbs some of i's energy. Since the Earth absorbed some of the sunlight's energy it didn't have enough energy to push it's way back out of the atmosphere so it just go back down to Earth and heats the Earth just like a green house.",3
118353,because the atmosphere is the top of something.,2
118346,"Because the sun is in the space,so the space cannot be the glass of the greenhouse,the atmosphere is close to the earth so it could be the glass.",2
118366,the atmosphere is a barrier that solar radiation bounces oof of,3
118352,The atmosphere is like the glass of the greenhouse because it keeps the heat in while keeping the radiation out.,3
118355,The atmostphere lets it stay in but everything else wants it out.,2
118338,The sun is reflecting off the glass which makes It bright like the sun.,2
118348,The sun because it is hot.,2
118349,the sun is beating down on the green glass.,2
118354,the sun reflects to the green house.,2
118351,The sun will keep the warmth inside of the greenhouse and move coldness away.,2
118361,0,1
118345,earth is like grass because it is the next lowest thing.,2
118341,"The heat that enters the greenhouse is trapped inside, just as the Earth's atmosphere traps in the suns rays.",4
118367,because the sun is hoter than space and the earth,2
118343,"I chose the atmosphere because it says the sun passes through the glass panels and heats the inside. Just like how in a car, on a hot day, the sun passes through the glass windows and heats the car.",3
118357,because the atmosphere capes the gravide in to the earth and the green house capes the heat in the green house.,2
118369,The atmosphere is surrounding the sun like in the picture.,2
118339,The dotted lines are the atmosphere and it has the same qualities as the windows.,2
118372,beacouse the arow is poninting of of the earth not the atmosspere.,2
118360,the atmosphere holds everything else onto earth so it could hold heat onto earth with its gravitational pull.,2
118356,I am not sure,1
118347,Air gets trapped inside but it can no escape like the greenhouse.,2
118371,Space is like the glass of the green house because the sunlight goes to space,3
118368,its glass,2
118364,the atmosphere takes the heat to keep the earth warm,2
118362,It traps some energy like the glass of the green house.,4
118397,I think Earth because in Picture B it shows Earth on the inside of the oval shown in Picture B.,2
118393,0,1
118417,i think why is beacuse the heat from the green house will take engery from the plants,2
118403,The atmosphere is like the glass because it dosent let the light out .,2
118410,the ocean is a green house gass,2
118392,well the atmosphere works like the glass from the green house from part A and that is how the heat does not scape from earth,3
118394,The earth is like the house because the sunlight is shining on the earth.,3
118413,The earth because it is where the light seems to be bouncing off of.,2
118408,it go therw the window,2
118409,the sun because green house are meant to shin sun on the the green house,2
118401,The atmosphere keeps the solar energy from escaping earths atmosphere because of gravity.,3
118405,the earth is like the panels because the earth atmisphere is not letting the sun escape,2
118402,Because at picture B it shows the greenhouse effecting earth,2
118406,"The atmosphere blocks radiation, but acts like a big window. ",3
118400,the earth is like the glass in the picture because it reflects.,2
118415,"The atmosphere is what surrounds the ""greenhouse"" (earth) which means it is like the glass of a greenhouse.",2
118398,Earth because it is on earth so i think that it would be earth,2
118395,Atmosphere because it's allowing the heat to go through and project heat to the earth.,2
118412,the atmosphere protects us so we dont get alot of sun,2
118391,It looks like earth's atmosphere is trapping the heat energy from the sun and letting the solar energy escape. ,2
118411,"The atmosphere is Earth's ""blanket"" so the lines bounce off the atmosphere.",2
118407,The earth is reflect the sun heat like the glass.,2
118414,The atmosphere collects could air.,2
118418,"I think it is the atmosphere because the atmosphere is like a shell that lets things come in, but does not let gases come in, but does not let gases out. ",2
118416,0,1
118396,the sun because it make one of the live and grow              ,2
118419,The sun as you could see that  the sun is coming straight to the green house and the earth,2
118404,0,1
118439,"The atmosphere is the layer outside of the Earth and it acts as a layer off invisible glass. For example, when a comet or rocket enters the atmosphere it sets on fire.",2
118437,glass just lets the sun go through so does the atmosphere.,2
118438,The earth is like the glass of the greenhouse. It will absorb heat and then release it.,2
118443,"The atmosphere around the green house is reflecting the sun and giving off heat, the original heat is from the sun.",2
118456,Atmosphere because the sunlight can get out just like the glass.,3
118455,the atmosphere acts like glass to create humidity ,2
118446,The atmosphere is like the glass in the greenhouse picture because it reflects the sunlight onto the earth to warm it.,3
118440,sun because the green color is light and it reflects off of the house and that is what the arrow is the heat is going in then coming out,2
118451,The earth soke in the sun light.,3
118462,just a guess i don't know,1
118442,because the heat is coming inside the atmosphere like it does for a greenhouse.,2
118447,The atmosphere because the greenhouse effect is what keeps the sun's heat inside to warm the earth.,2
118441,Because the picture suggests that the sun is like the greenhouse glass.,2
118452,"I think that it is earth because the glass is reflecting the sun,also the earth is reflecting the sun?",2
118461,The atmosphere lets air come in but it doesn't let it come out,2
118460,Because it is like the glass that does't let the heat out. ,2
118464,its the sun because sun goes back,2
118453,I dont know.,1
118458,"in the greenhouse, the light is going through the glass and bouncing off of the walls and the light in the atmosphere is bouncing off the walls of the atmosphere and the earth.   ",3
118454,The air is so polluted that it keeps the warm air in and the cold air out.,2
118457,the sun heat goes thru the glass which makes it hot in the green house ,2
118445,"The atmosphere traps the heat inside, like the glass does with the heat from the greenhouse.",3
118450,I think the Earth because the heat would affect the Earth much like it did to the glass.,2
118459,I found the anser by in the picture the sun ray is inside the green house not going the outside.,2
118463,because the atmosphere traps the suns heat so the earth could stay warm,2
118448,The atmosphere because it acts like an insulator to keep heat in.,3
118444,"Earths atmosphere holds in the heat, just like the glass of a greenhouse.",3
118476,0,1
118481,it is showing sun shining down on earth is many many green houses.,2
118535,Earth absorbs heat so that we can stay warm and the green house's roof also absorbs heat so that the plants can grow. since they both absorb heat they both are alike.,2
118540,The atmosphere is just like the picture with the glass because it's traping gases.,2
118544,i think earth will reflect the heat into the ground and absorbs it,2
118527,really don't know it was a guess,1
118557,In picture B the earth is acting like glass on the greenhouse because the glass reflects sunlight and the earth is reflecting sunlight.,3
118528,because the windows are keeping in the heat so is the atmosphere,3
118531,0,1
118524, The atmosphere acts as the glass of the greenhouse because they both keep the warmth in.,3
118545,"the sun, because it makes the light green and it gets reflected and makes the glass hot",2
118558,0,1
118561,The atmosphere keeps the heat on earth because it acts like a shield.,2
118525,it is earth because it shows it on the picture,2
118539,it goes through the glass into the house. With the atmosphere it goes through the atmosphere into the earth,2
118554,refelicon,2
118566,The atmosphere of the green house is the outside of it.,2
118565,It is because in the picture it shows that around the earth is an atmosphere that surounds the Earth an keeps the air inside.,2
118550,It looks like the sunlight is repelling off the atmosphere.,3
118551,0,1
118547,the sun goes on the greenhouse so it reflet on the window ,2
118560,the sun is hitting the glass,2
118568,porquecalienta,1
118553,it's the sun because that makes the flowers healther and makes them survive more,2
118546,The Earth's atmosphere stops the suns heat from escaping Earth just like the greenhouse stops the suns heat from escaping it.,2
118538,It is yellow shine.,2
118552,i don't know,1
118563,The sun is giving out energy ,3
118555,the sun because that is were the light comes from,3
118569,I personaly think that the atmosphere is like the glass of the green house,2
118571,i think it is space because it will act like the green house,2
118559,idont know,1
118564,Because of the rays of the suns.Both,3
118570,0,1
118585,it is like a green house because it reflects the light back into the sun,3
118590,the dotted line is the atmosphere. The cold air reflects off the atmospkere. ,2
118575,the atmosphere holds in all the gasses so they cant escape.,2
118594,because the atmosphere is in the clouds and if you pass the clouds your in space ,2
118586,"because the earth is like a hollow ball ,heat can enter but heat cannot escape
",2
118595,when it get to hot and the sun cant come in the sun serounds the area that it cant ,2
118578,Picture B is like the green house because it is similar to the suns raise bouncing off the earth.,3
118593,It is like the window because it lets in the sun just like a window.,2
118582,because the sun goes through,2
118587,the sun because the sun gooies throu the glass,2
118588,11 is the new F,1
118589,0,2
118579,"The atmosphere because it is like the glass, letting the gas out.",2
118603,cause it looks like the light is coming in side.,2
118592,It is the same like the atmosphere because the panels from the green house keeps the hot air from the sun .The atmosphere lets the hot air in so that is how we get the hot into our house when it cold and also we it is a hot day.,2
118584,I chose this answer because the atmosphere is holding the light from the sun in and the glass is holding the heat in,3
118576,I said this because the sun looks like it is reflecting off something.,2
118599,The atmosphere because the air is coming in and out.,2
118577,The atmoshere works like the glass on a greenhouse,2
118591,It looks the same because the sun goes into the greenhouse just like its going into the atmosphere.,2
118580,I choose that answer because the sun is reflecting of the glass and shining on the plants and making them grow.,2
118598,"The atmosphere is like the glass because it's letting heat in, but isn't letting it out.",3
118581,The earth looks like a greenhouse class because it absorbs the heat.,2
118619,The atmosphere surrounds the Earth like the glass surrounds the greenhouse.,2
118608,The sun gives of heat and the the squiggly lines makes it look like it is hot in their ,2
118597,it is earth because earth is like a greenhouse,2
118630,0,1
118583,because the sun rays are trapped,3
118637,because the sun is toward the earth and the earth is geting heated ,2
119017,"In the the greenhouse, sun goes through the glass. In the earth picture, the sun is going through the atmosphere",2
118296,The atmosphere acts like glass because heat can't get out. ,3
118300,Because the sun is heating up the greenhouse and it gets very hot.,2
118302,The Atmosphere is like the glass of the greenhouse because what comes out of it dose not come back in side.,2
118310,I think the sun is the glass on the green house because it shows that the sun goes in the atmospher and gets out when it hits the glass again. ,2
118304,The IR bounces off the surface and is trapped in the source.,4
118313,The atmosphere absorbs sunlight and traps it on the surface of the earth which is very much alike the greenhouse.,4
118319,the atmosphere traps heat in like the reflective glass in the greenhouse.,3
118297,Because the sun is the heat in the green house and in the sun picture the gas is the heat in the greenhouse picture.,2
118298,The atmosphere acts like the glass because the heat goes straight through.,2
118311,Because the atmosphere prevents some gasses that are dangerous to come to earth.,2
118305,the sun would light the green house,2
118293,The atmoshere is like the glass because the light can get in the atmosphere but can't get out.,4
118299,If you think about a little that lines moving toward the greenhouse could be solar radiation because basiclly solar radiation is the sun so thats what i think.,3
118309,because i see a picture of earth on the other side,2
118307,Because the atmosphere is what keeps heat and gravity here on earth.,3
118306,"the glass makes the green house hot,and the sun keeps the earth hot.",2
118308,the sun because it will provide heat in a greenhouse,2
118321,Because you can see how the earth looks kind of like a glass.,2
118312,I think it is the atmosphere because most gets reflective and the rest gets absorbed.  ,2
118318,#N/A,1
118303,the atmosphere because the atmosphere looks like but it works like the glass to.,2
118314,0,1
118301,I chose the atmosphere because it looks like the glass in the the green house.,2
118316,the sun shines the light in too the earth ,3
118320,This was my answer because the top of the green house would be the glass and that is where the sun would be shining.,2
118294,The heat gets trapped inside the atmosphere the the heat getting trapped inside the greenhouse.,3
118315,the atmosphere is like a green house but instead of using glass the atmosphere has green house gasses which absorbs heat and keeps heat in which is what we call globle warming,4
118323,the atmosphere around the earth keeps the heat inside just like the glass in the greenhouse picture.,3
118482,because there something down from the sun to earth.,2
118478,The green house gasses collect up in the atmosphere and it is making the earth heat up quicker.,2
118479,The sun because it affects the green house in many different ways,2
118480,I think its because it traps the heat in our atmosphere just like a greenhouse.,3
118473,because it shows in the picture the it show the atmisphere.,2
118474,it will get hot,2
118483,The atmosphere brings in heat and does not let it escape.,2
118470,"In the green house there is glass that keeps the heat trapped in, and in the Picture ""B"" the atmosphere seems to be doing the same thing. ",3
118472,0,1
118468,The atmosphere is like the glass in the greenhouse because the glass makes it so the gas can come inside of the atmosphere and the atmosphere makes it so the gasses don't escape.,2
118475,The sunlight is absorbed by the ground and trapped underground.,3
118477,The reason why I chose the sun was because the sun hits both the planet and the greenhouse of course cause its on the planet earth . So the sun is the better option to this question.,2
118465,"It lets the solar radiation in and keeps the heat in as well.
",4
118487,the atmosphere is trapping the heat to,3
118488,0,1
118486,The atmosphere because it doesn't really absorb the heat and energy.,3
118484,I did this because the sun gives heat...,2
118485,the atmosphere because it works like a bubble.,2
118490,the atmosphere is like the glass because it protects the world acting like a bubble,2
118467,I chose atmosphere because it acts like if there was windows and its staying inside.,2
118471,The glass and the atmosphere keep heat inside but they don't keep all of the infrared radiation.,4
118469,the earth is green.,2
118466,"In the photo the light goes through the atmosphere and the glass,but stays inside the atmosphere and glass.",3
118543, The atmosphere is like the glass because the atmosphere is protecting the earth and the glass is protecting the green houses,2
118515,i think it is the atmosphere because the atmosphere is around the earth by space.,2
118517,it takes heat in but not out.,3
118533,because the atmosphere is reflecting the heat.,2
118518,The atmosphere will keep the air trapped in like the glass on the green house does. Thus creating the same effect.,2
118548,I think it is the Earth because the heat from the sun is going inside the Earth.,2
118522,atmosphere because it can reflect and obsorbe,2
118562,k,1
118526,It would be the earth because the earth gathers the heat just like the green house.,2
118567,The atmosphere is like the glass because it is able to trap the heat inside the earth.,2
118516,I think it is the atmosphere because the solar radiation can bounce off the atmosphere like glass on a green house,3
118521,the atmosphere acts like a reflector.,2
118520,#N/A,1
118514,"Some of the light from the sun is passing into the greenhouse through the sun, and some is getting reflected. The same thing is happening with the sunlight passing through the atmosphere and into the earth.",4

118509,It is like a ring around the earth.,2
118534,"the sun reflect light that can be green
",3
118519,I choose the earth because the sun reflects the earth but it bounces off.,2
118511,The atmosphere is what the earth uses as a shield. So the atmosphere is like the glass of a green house.,2
118542,The sun because the sunlight in the picture almost has the same radiation as the greenhouse gasses.,3
118537,I chose sun because the sun reflecting is a fact.,2
118529,"I think it is the earth because the earth will obsobe some of the heat but then it will reflect some of the heat, this turns into infered radiation.",3
118536,"like the atmosphere, the glass is how the heat gets through to the plants, or the earth.",2
118523,0,1
118530,because the sun goes into the panels and th sun gives sun light to the plants.,3
118510,The atmosphere lets heat in and keeps heat in like the glass.,3
118513,Earth because it keeps the heat like the greenhouse.,3
118556,It is like the green house gasses because they keep the heat in.,3
118549,"i think this because the atmosphere is like the green house glass because the glass traps the sunlight just like the atmosphere dose with the sunlight the atmosphere traps the sunlight then the plants absorb it.
",4
118607,The glass panels of the green house is like greenhouse gases. greenhouse gases trap heat in Earth's atmosphere as the glass panels of the green house does.,3
118622,The atmosphere because it absorbes heat,2
118604,the atmosphere is like an invisable wall.,2
118614,the sun is like the glass because it keeps the heat in the green house.,2
118628,The Atmosphere is the glass because it is the thing that absorbs the Heat and the Solar Radiation.,3
118632,its the atmosphere because its sucking sunlight inside the earth,3
118602,"i chose the sun because i see, in the picture of the green house, rays of heat entering the green house.",2
118600,It keeps the heat inside.,3
118623,The greenhouse is giving off heat and the sun does the same thing.,2
118613,it shows the sun rays hitting earth and reflecting,3
118610,in picture b the atmosphere keeps the gravity and oxygen within bounds. ,2
118618,I said the atmosphere is like the glass because lets different gasses in.,2
118626,         I think the atmosphere is like the glass because it lets the heat in but not out.,3
118621,because the sun hits the earth like the sun hits the glass in a green house ,2
118611,#N/A,1
118606,when light hits the earth the earth traps it to stay warm.,4
118620,because it is like glass it doesnt let go.,2
118616,The earth is like the glass of the greenhouse because the Earth is the suns space.,2
118601,The atmosphere is like the glass because it reflects and absorbs.,2
118615,The sun cause the sun passes through the glass the it gives heat to the plants and the plants will grow.,2
118624,"I chose this answer because in Picture B, the sun's light is going on the Earth's surface, and the atmosphere is reflecting back the light the sun is giving.",3
118634,#N/A,1
118609,#N/A,1
118612,becouse the atmosphere is like the glass lets it in and keeps it in the house for a while  ,2
118947,Light can travel through the atmosphere but sometimes it will bump into something in the atmosphere which would reflect or absorb the energy.,3
118344,i chose the atmosphere because it is like glass keeping the heats in.,3
118337,  ,1
118358,Because the glass is reflecting the greenhouse gases and so is the Earth.,2
118350,The atmosphere is alike because it holds in the heat and doesn't let it out but let's it in.,3
118353,The atmosphere because it will shin out ans in.,2
118346,because the sun is in space already so it can´t be the glass of the green house.,2
118366,It keeps the solar radiation in the earth like glass,4
118352,The reason the atmosphere is like the glass is because the atmosphere like the glass reflects some light and absorbs some light.,3
118355,The atmostphre lets heat in but lets it out when broken.,2
118338,I said earth because some of the heat is reflecting off and some of the heat is going through the glass.,2
118348,the sun because it is shining in the green house.,2
118349,The outide of earth represents class in a green house.,2
118354,the sun is bouncing off the earth and then into the space,2
118351,The suns heat has to go in the inside for it to heat the plants.,2
118361,I think sun because sun look like glass.,2
118345,this is like the glass because it lets some through and reflect some,2
118341,The atmosphere and the glass both trap heat inside.,3
118367,because the sun is yellow and the will reflect the glass.,2
118343,The atmosphere is like the glass of the greenhouse because the sun can reflect in and out;the sun can pass through the atmosphere.,2
118357,because they both absorb the heat and let it in.,3
118369,#N/A,1
118339,They both technically do the same job.,3
118372,the atmosphere is like the glass beacouse it ceeps the inside hot.,2
118360,the atmosphere is letting cold air out and keeping heat and light in.,3
118356,the earth is absorbing the heat  and not letting it come out,2
118347,It appears to be the same because the sun heat will go inside but when it tries to escape it will; instead bounce around but cannot escape. ,2
118371,i think it is sun because the sun reflects light. ,2
118368,the heat is reflecting trough to give the plants sun.,2
118364,the atmosphere is like a greenhouse because it keeps the heat from escaping,3
118362,#N/A,1
118397,The sun because sunlight grows plants.,3
118393,    I think it is the atmosphere because it acts like glass and heat can go in but only some can be relseted.,3
118417,0,1
118403,The atmosphere doesn't let out the heat just like the glass from the greenhouse.,3
118410,It is on the green on the earth.,2
118392,#N/A,1
118394,The sunlight is shining through the Atmosphere.,3
118413,atmosphere because the glass of a green house keeps the heat inside of the greenhouse and the atmosphere keeps heat inside of the earths atmosphere,3
118408,because the atmosphere asorbs the heat and reaflects the heat,2
118409,it the sun because in the green house the sun put the heat inside of it,2
118401,The atmosphere is just like the glass panels in the green house because it keeps heat inside the earth just like the greenhouse. ,3
118405,the glass is the part that lets the haet inside and so does the atmosphere but when it turns night the  heat is relesed and same like the greenhouse when the widows open or a door the heat is realesed ,2
118402,Because the atmosphere keeps the sun in with the earth,2
118406,The glass of the greenhouse is like the atmosphere because they both are making the heat more powerful.,2
118400,Its earth because the sun is reflecting of of it.,2
118415,The atmosphere is like the glass of a greenhouse because they both let the Solar Radiation through to the ground to turn into heat.,4
118398,The sun because it gives heat,2
118395,The atmosphere because it shows the light and heat going up and coming back down to earth. And the glass acts like the atmosphere and shows that it reflects off the glass once it goes in.,3
118412,because the atmophere reflects some sun light so that it doesnt give the earth to much sun light,3
118391,The glass on the green house allows solar radiation to enter and release infrared radiation and capture the heat energy.,3
118411,The glass is in between the sun and crops and the atmosphere is in between the sun and Earth.,2
118407,"The glass lets the light in, but does not let the heat escape. That is like what the atmosphere does.",4
118414,It captures the heat and reflects it. ,2
118418,"The atmosphere is like glass, except stronger because in the picture, it shows atmosphere acting the same.",2
118416,I think this because the Atmosphere Keeps the heat in like the glass.,3
118396,0,1
118419,The sun is going to the greenhouse.,2
118404,inside the greenhouse is so hot because if is sunny the hot will go inside the greenhouse,2
118439,the atmosphere turn solar radiation to heat,3
118437,it lets solar radiation go through same with glass,3
118438,Both earth and the greenhouse absorb heat and then release the heat after a while.,2
118443,"The atmosphere reflects the solar radiation ,that was inside the Earth's atmosphere, towards the Earth's surface",3
118456,"I picked atmosphere because just like the greenhouse glass, the heat goes through the atmosphere.",2
118455,the atmoshere is like a layer of glass,2
118446,The glass is like the atmosphere because it lets in sunlight which provides heat.,4
118440,The atmosphere because the heat comes from there,2
118451,The atmosphere is like the glass because it aborbeds the heat,2
118462,well the atmosphere is my best guess because i am not really sure of this one.,2
118442,because it lets light into the earth,3
118447,The atmosphere is keeping the heat in.,3
118441,The atmosphere lets the heat pass through like the greenhouse glass.,2
118452,because it is reflecting off the earth and it is kind of absorbing it too,2
118461,The atmosphere keeps the air in the inside in and on the outside out because only heat can travel in.,2
118460,The atmosphere because its like acting as a reflector to the inside and doesn't let the sun out.,2
118464,it is like the atmosphere because it blocks the sun. ,2
118453,The glass is the like the atmospher on the earth because the glass is the roof and the atmosthphere is a roof to the earth.,2
118458,The sun is bouncing off of the windows of the green house like the sun is bouncing off of the atmosephere. ,2
118454,The heat is getting trapped in the air and heating earth ,3
118457,Earth because the heat would bounce off the shiny stuff on earth,2
118445,"Like the glass, the atmosphere traps the infrared radiation inside the atmosphere, warming the Earth.",5
118450,I think the atmosphere because just like the heat shines through the glass matches when the heat goes through the Earth's atmosphere.,2
118459, The atmosphere is like a green house because the heat doesn´t escape.,3
118463,because the atmosphere is keeping the sun's heat to keep the earth warm. ,2
118448,Atmosphere because it holds in heat just like the glass.,3
118444,"Earth's atmosphere keeps in some of the heat, just like the glass. ",3
118476,I think sun because it is effecting the greenhouse.,2
118481,on the earth you see blue arrows pointing back out into the sky ,2
118535,The atmosphere is like the glass because its the area BEFORE the heat hits the earth. The glass on the greenhouse is also the area BEFORE it hits the greenhouse so they are both acting as the same thing but in different forms. ,2
118540,I think it's the atmosphere because it's like a blanket covering just like the glass.,2
118544,its like the glass because the heat just goes right through the atmosphere.,2
118527,I am not really sure,1
118557,The earth and the glass act similar because they both reflect heat and they both absorb heat.,2
118528,"it reflects heat back in just like glass
",2
118531,The atmosphere will be like glass because the pressure will keep the heat inside.,2
118524,The glass of the greenhouse is most like the Earth because the surface of Earth is reflecting and absorbing the heat as the glass of the greenhouse is.,2
118545,I would choose earth  because  the glass acts similar gecause both reflect heat and  they absorb heat.,2
118558,Earth because on the picture it shows something reflecting of the earth.,2
118561,I think its atmosphere because once solar radiation comes through it stays trapped and only a little gets out.,4
118525,i chose the atmosphere because it is like a shield around earth.,2
118539,this allows light to come into earth that will later be transfered into light,2
118554,it is like a windo that reflects and lets in light,3
118566,The sun gives the heat and the glass is what does not let the energy out.,2
118565,It is because they acted as if they were both an atmosphere,2
118550,It reflects solar radiation.,3
118551,The sun reflects off of the earth because the earths crust.,2
118547,because the sun hit the glass,2
118560,it looks like it.,2
118568,porquese calienta,2
118553,because their both green so they are like sister and brothers.,1
118546,The atmosphere stops the heat energy from escaping just like the glass in the greenhouse.,3
118538,It is earth because some of the energy is being absorbed and some is being reflected. ,2
118552,the sun hits the Atmosphere.,2
118563,The heat has to pass the glass to heat the plants and Earth is like that also;the heat passes through the atmosphere and then heats the Earth.,2
118555,The atmosphere because that us were the sun reflects to the green house gases.,2
118569,the atmosphere because it is like a glass to cover the sun away .,2
118571,The atmosphere is acting like the glass of the greenhouse.,2
118559,0,1
118564,Because the rays of the sun goes into the greenhouse.,3
118570,0,1
118585,the sun is like the grass of the green house because the light is going into the green house and is trapped and that's whats happening also to the atmosphere. ,4
118590,it keeps the cold air moving and the suns rays out,3
118575,The atmosphere is like a hood ,2
118594,why because the clouds are there and when you pass the clouds you go into space.,2
118586,0,1
118595,0,1
118578,In picture B the suns radiation is bouncing off the earth and absorbing the suns heat just like how the sun passes through the glass pannels.,3
118593,"The Earth is like the greenhouse because it lets in most of the heat, light, and energy.",3
118582,because it show on the pic that the sun reflect like the glass of the green house,2
118587,i think it is the atmosphere because it acts like the glass from the green house.,2
118588,Because it does the same job as the green house gases.,3
118589,The heat from the sun passes through the atmosphere as if the het from the sun going to the greenhouse would be passing through the glass panels which lets heat in and keeps heat in.,2
118579,glass acts like the atmosphere. turning sr into heat.,4
118603,Because the heat will be reflting of.,2
118592,The atmosphere because the house is letting the heat from the sun go in and that is like the atmosphere which also lets the suns heat go in earths atmosphere. ,2
118584,0,1
118576,The atmosphere has heat in it so the sun will go through the atmosphere and put heat into it.,2
118599,Atmosphere because the sun goes to the atmosphere,2

118598,The atmosphere was like the glass because in kept the heat and sunlight in.,4
118581,Its like the glass because heat from sun is getting absorbed.,2
118619,the atmosphere surrounds the earth like the glass around the green house.,2
118608,The sun is the glass of the greenhouse because the suns heat is kept inside the greenhouse. And the more the heat comes in the more hot it gets inside a greenhouse.,3
118597,the earth because it is getting heated.,2
118630,It is the sun because that is were the solar radiation comes from. ,3
118583, in a green house solar radiation  gets sucked in then it is not allowed to leave.,4
118637,0,1
119017,"The heat is going through the atmosphere, like when it goes through the glass.",2
136389,I think that the atmosphere is like the glass of the greenhouse. The glass lets panels let sun pass through and keeps the heat energy from escaping. This is also what the atmosphere does. It lets heat from the sun to earth and keeps some energy in.,5
136362,It surrounds the stuff in the green house just like the atmosphere surrounds teh Earth. It is like a shell.,2
136368,When it hits off the greenhouse glass it was reflected. WHen I saw that the earth reflected sunlight it looked like the greenhouse glass.,3
136372,Atmosphere because the heat from the sun kinda goes through the atmosphere like the glass.,2
136352,"The atmosphere holds in Earth's gasses and heat, like a greenhouse. ",3
136382,The atmosphere can reflect and absorb a lot of the energy the sun is exporting. When it absorbs the energy it stays withen the atmosphere trapping heat.,3
136374,Because some light is being reflected and some is being absorbed. ,3
136356,The atmosphere is like the glass of the greenhouse because when the sun hits the earth it reflects or bounces off and hits the atmosphere making the heat trapped inside. Once it hit's the atmosphere it just will keep on bouncing. ,3
136370,I think it is the Atmosphere is like the glass because it is protecting somethings that would be harmful to the plants.,2
136354,I chose that because it looked like it would be the glass and also it reflected some of the sun so it dosen't get to hot,2
136367,the atmosphere because the doted line is the layers of the atmosphere.,2
136388,"The blue lines in picture A ""bounces"" off the glass and in picture B the blue lines ""bounce"" of the top of the atmosphere before reaching the outside of the atmosphere.",2
136683,be case it reflects,2
136369,"The atmosphere is keeping the suns rays in when it hit the earth, just like the green house it keeps the suns rays in.",4
136378,The heat of the sun comes in past the atmosphere touches the earth come back up and then it will get reflected by the atmosphere.,2
136359,It's like the atmosphere because the sun is shining down on the greenhouse just like the atmosphere. ,2
136390,I think that the Earth is like the glass in the green house because it is reflecting the sun just like the glass on the green house.,2
136375,Because the atmosphere keeps the heat from coming out of the earth. ,3
136384,At the atmosphere when the sun shines down the atmosphere absorbs it.,2
136387,The atmosphere lets the rays from the sun get to earth but they don't let the rays escape.,5
136366,The sun is just one big ball of gas and it gives everything life ( go back to the mysystem) and also the sun is responsibe for space the atmosphere and earth to have gases,2
136363,It traps the heat from going into space.,3
136373,It looks like the sun is coming from the glass on top of the house thing.,2
136360,"Because its shining on it.
",2
136364,The suns rays goes through the atmosphere and travles to the green house causing it to get the green house. ,3
136380,"You can see in the picture that the Troposphere is like the glass on the greenhouse, it keeps the heat in that the sun producing. That is what keeps Earth warm on there really warm days all day, the Troposphere keeps the heat in close to Earth.   ",3
136391,I think its earth because the green house his like the earth getting heat from the sun.,2
136379, Because it takes in light from the sun,3
136377,i said the sun because the green house yo could see the light coming in and making thepalce hooter and the sun refelcts on something ,3
136381,I chose Earth because in picture A it shows the waves from the sun goes into the greenhouse and that is what the sun is doing in picture B.,2
136361,The atmosphere is like the green house because heat can go through the atmosphere and heat the earth up.,3
136685,It is the thing covering it.,2
136419,The glass of the green house lets in heat energy but doesn't let it out so does the earths atmosphere. It lets some heat en energy in but not out. ,4
136415,I just know,1
136395,The greenhouse will absorb some heat and reflect some heat like the atmosphere.,2
136393,"The atmosphere lets in the energy, but when it tries to go back into space, only a little bit can escape, most bouncing off back to Earth. The atmosphere is like the greenhouse glass. ",4
136408,In the picture the Earth is reflecting the heat,3
136421,The atmosphere keeps the energy inside,4
136404,It looks like the earth is like the glass because I see the light getting reflected of earth and bouncing back into space.,3
136420,The atmosphere is whats bouncing the light and heat back to the earth.,3
136414,"I chose that because both the atmosphere, and the greenhouse are reflecting the light. ",3
136392,The Earth is acts like the glass since it's absorbing the heat the keeping it in there.,2
136397,I think the atmosphere because it kinda of acts like the glass on the green house.,2
136424,the atmosphere is like it because it let light in but reflects some.,4
136423,"Just like the windows, the Space soaks in all the heat energy that has been diflected from the Earth.",2
136403,"It is like the atmosphere, because there is a line and it shows the sun reflecting off of the Earth, which the Earth is like the table. ",2
136412,"because most of the time the eath reflects off the earth and back to space like glass dose.

",2
136407,Both keep in the heat.,3
136411,BECAUSE IT IS THE MOST HOT AND BRINGS IN HEAT ,2
136402,"That is where the sun is coming in, through the glass.",2
136400,The glass blocks heat from going out of the green house and the atmosphere does that to.,3
136406,On picture be it shows the earth REFLECTING the sun beams.,2
136405,I think it's the atmosphere because it's just like the glass of the green house. Well i think this because it lets in the sun's eat just like the house. Once it gets inside it'd traped. ,4
136416,so the plants get sunlight,3
136409,The atmosphere lets heat in but does not let the heat escape.  Which makes it like the glass on a greenhouse.,4
136398,In picture it shows the sun's rays of light bouncing off Earth and hitting the dotted line. That dotted line represents the Earth's atmosphere.,3
136418,Earth has life on it but we are like a green house because when the sun hits on us it makes plants grow and how Earth is a green house is because a green house it meant to help plants grow and on Earth we are always a Green house because the sun always hits on us and makes the plants grow ,2
136399,because the atmosphere is getting rid of any sun radiation that can hurt us ,3
136417,I think that the atmosphere because it has a protection.,2
136425,I chose sun because the sun has allthe heat which is heating the Earth. ,2
136394,The atmosphere because it is around Earth and protecting it from the suns rays.,3
136422,I think it is the sun because sun passes through the glass panels and heats the inside of the greenhouse. ,3
136410,"Because it is a layer that surrounds the earth, traps heat, and does not let it escape.",3
136396,because the glass reflects heat ,2
136426,Trapping the rays in.,3
136413,"The atmosphere reflects heat around the earth and goes all around, the glass is like an atmosphere.",2
136453,"The atmosphere is acting like the glass of a greenhouse which is reflecting the light back at the Earth, creating heat.",3
136451,Because it is reflecting the solar energy just like the glass would.,3
136462,"The atmosphere refelcts the ligth back into space, but stores a little part of the radaion",3
136481,The atmosphere is like the glass of a greenhouse because it's like it bouncing back inside of the atmosphere like the heat does in a greenhouse.,3
136460,The atmosphere surrounds the earth kind of like the glass in the greenhouse. Also the arrows are bouncing off the earth like they did to the plants and then they can't escape through the atmosphere. ,2
136457,"Well, the atmosphere is kinda the only thing that floats invisibly above space. Excluding space at least. Also, don't 1 or 2 of the layers in the atmosphere have a lot of heat of at least catches a lot..?",2
136459,The sun looks like it's beating down on the greenhouse because the sun probably found something it could work on,2
136476,The green room is supposed to let the suns raise come in and keep the green room hot.,4
136456,"The atmosphere is thick enough to trap the heat on Earth, which basically keeps us alive.",3
136483,I think this because the glass of the green house does the same job the atmosphere.,2
136463,The atmosphere traps the heat just like the glass.,3
136450,It is like the atmosphere because it keeps in the heat.,3
136482,,1
136467,"The atmosphere, is cleary stopping the heat from leaving.And the arrows don't move past the atmosphere.",3
136454,I think its the Atmoshere because its one the earth's layers.,2
136465,"The atmosphere keeps the heat inside of earth
",3
136477,The atmosphere because the atmosphere is reflecting to.,2
136468,The atmosphere is like the glass because that's what keeps us breathing so its like barrier protecting us by not let the air out.,2
136461,the Earth looks like most of the light is being reflected because the Earth is made of bright colors so most of the light is reflected just like glass,3
136475,The sun keeps the greenhouse hotter because the sun has energy.,2
141559,well earth can take heat and let some out so it can be kinda like a green house but will like millions of people ,2
136485,,1
136452,It is bouncing off.,2
136471,the sun goes threw glass,3
136474,"The heat bounces back, like in picture A, to Earth.",2
141560,,1
136469,I picked that answer because the sun is shinning down and earth is refecting it and the atmoshere is containing it.,3
141561,I think it's the atmosphere because on the earth picture it has a layer above it like the earth is the house and the atmosphere is the roof/glass.,2
136480,Because the sun hit the greenhouse and reflected back somewhere else into space probably.,2
136464,"The reason is that the Atmosphere covers the Earth, and keeps us safe you could say. And the Green House is like the Atmosphere for plants, it provides what it needs. And that is my reasoning.",2
136455,The greenhouse's glass roof (at least I think it's glass),2
136492,I think it is atmosphere because in picture B the atmosphere is trapping the heat from come out.,3
136500,I chose the sun because it is moving very crookedly like the red lines in the green house.,2
136494,I chose the atmosphere because it holds the heat from the sun that goes off the Earth and into the atmosphere.,2
136495,"The atmosphere is like the glass because it absorbs UV light and it hovers over and all around Earth, just like the glass.",3
136499,"I think the glass from the greenhouse would be the atmosphere. I say this because the sun shines through the atmosphere and the atmosphere keeps in the good heat, and throughs out the bad.",3
136489,"I said the atmosphere because like the glass of a green house, the atmosphere is keeping everything inside of the area. Although the greenhouse gases keep the heat inside too.",3
136498,The atmosphere is like the glass of the greenhouse because the atmosphere keeps the warm air enclosed so it doesn't escape. ,3
136503,It is Atmosphere because the Atmosphere is between the greenhouse and the sun.,2
136509,The plants will asorb the sunlight and the plants have water insied of them to.,3
141563,the sun is going too refect to the window,2
136504,I think it is the atmosphere is the glass because the glass makes all the energy's reflect the sun from the glass . that is why I think that the atmosphere is the glass .,3
136490,The red lines are the sun radiations and the blue lines what is happening in the atmosphere. The inside of the greenhouse and the outside is space and where the sun is. The atmosphere is protecting us from the ragging hot sun waves and rays.,3
136516,The atmosphere doesn't let oxygen escape.,2
136507,The glass acts like the atmosphere because heat come through it but cannot escape.,4
136515,The atmosphere because it was keeping the heat inside.,3
136501,"The atmosphere is like the green house window because it lets the heat in, but does not let the heat out of its ""protective"" layer.",4
136505,"I chose earth, because if the sun is going down on the green house glass, the glass is sort of like the the earths crust where the sun is beating down on the crust.",2
,,1
136491,"The glass in the greenhouse moves the sunlight on other things wildly, just like the atmosphere.",3
136511,because there are 4 different layers helping out earth ,2
136513,Because in this situation I think the greenhouse is so post to represent the earth by showing about the atmosphere.,2
136502,It is because heat is coming which came from the sun.,2
136508,I chose Atmosphere because in picture B there is a circle shape around the earth. That's why ichose atmosphere.,2
136493,,1
136518,,1
136512,The heat energy bounces off of the layers in the atmosphere it looked like and it didn't go straight back to the sun.,2
136506,The atmosphere acts like glass in a greenhouse because the atmosphere has a ozone which absorbs and reflects light.,3
136497,"That is because above the earth is the atmoshere.                                                                                          
                                                                                                                                                                             ",2
136514,I chose the atmosphere because when I look at the arrows that are coming from the sun it looks like the arrows are coming from the sun staying inside the atmosphere area and said that picture B was a picture of the green house with glass the glass holds in all the heat so I mainly thought it was the atmosphere because it looks like all the heat from the sun seems to be trapped inside the atmosphere.,2
136519,The green house is like the earth because the heat and light comes from the sun but now its trapped by the     green house like what the earth does.When light hits earth it gives us light and height like it does to earth.,4
136522,The atmosphere is like the glass of the greenhouse because it can absorb light.,3
136496,traped heat in ozone,2
136517,"This is because the gases go from Earth to space, but get blocked by the atmosphere and bounce back.",2
136520,,1
136571,The atmospher is like a window also reflecting most of the light but light is still cominig in helping the plants and things grow.,4
136550,"The atmosphere looks like it could be the house, its on the outside like the roof and the sun waves go through a little.",2
136557,"Earth is the planet, which is the one who bounces the heat. The sun is 93 million miles away from Earth, and is the one radiating heat. Space is the place where the heat travels through.",3
136566,the glass will take the sun's heat then the sun's heat can't escape. that is like what the atmosphere is doing.,2
136558,I picked that because the suns rays are going right through.,3
136555,The atmosphere is like a roof around the Earth so the heat wont go out.,3
136563,The ozone layer keeps the heat in.,2
136556,I chose the sun because the other answers make no sense in any way. ,2
136569,"The atmosphere is like the glass, trapping some heat inside it.",3
136574,I think it is the atmosphere because it is above earth and because I heard that one of the atmosphere's layers is really hot because it traps the energy.,4
136565,,1
136561,The atmosphere owns and keeps territory of the ozone layer which keeps the heat inside.,2
136583,I said this because the gasses we create can trap heat inside the atmosphere.,3
136551,the atmosphere traps the sun like a greenhouse  ,3
136549,"The atmosphere is like a green house, because sun light passes right threw it into earth, just like glass in the green house.",4
136570,The heat from the sun enters the atmosphere and the atmosphere prevents the heat from escaping.,2
136560,Becasue in the atmosphere it bounces around like it does in the other picture,2
136572,Earth becasue it traps the heat,3
136559,It stops at the atmosphere.,2
136564,"The atmosphere is like the glass of a greenhouse because the heat can come inside it, but it can not get out, it just bounces off the atmosphere.",4
136567,The atmosphere because it keeps the heat energy but no direct heat. ,3
136553,because in the real one it shows the blue arrows pointing to the glass and in B the earth has blue lines pointing to the dotted line.,2
136546,"The atmosphere is like glass on a greenhouse, it keeps in some sunlight or heat and uses it to our advantage.",4
136580,The glass of the green house is like the atmosphere because the sunlight is reflecting off of it.,3
136576,i choose this answer because in the atmosphere there are four layers the mesosphere the thermosphere the stratosphere and the troposphere they all transfer that heat threw to the earth and then come back up and get traped so that there is heat on earth for people to live.,4
136355,"I chose atmosphere because when the light passes through the glass, it can't really escape, so when the arrows touch the thermosphere, it bounces back towards the Earth again.",5
136351,I chose earth because when the sun hits key points in the earth the sun beam will reflect back to the atmosphere.,2
136389,"The glass of the greenhouse keeps the solar radiation that comes in, in. It also reflects some of the solar radiation. This is what the atmosphere does for the Earth. It does reflect some solar radiation but it also makes the heat that comes in the atmosphere stay in the atmosphere.",5
136373,The sun is literally going inside of the greenhouse and heating things up. ,2
136377,i choose the earth because the sun reflects on the earth and makes the earth heat up ,2
136366,It's the atmostsphere shows it being the class because it picture B its shows the sun reflecting off of the atmostphere so the glass is that.,2
136356,I think that the atmosphere is like the glass in the greenhouse because the greenhouse glass absorbs the solar radiation and traps it in because the glass reflects the solar radiation. Just like the atmosphere. The sun gives solar radiation to the earth but once it enters the atmosphere it's trapped because it reflects the solar radiation like the greenhouse glass.,4
136363,The atmosphere would try and keep the heat from escaping.,3
136375,The atmosphere acts like the glass because it reflects most heat but traps what ever heat managed to get in.,3
136370,I let some things in and it doesn't let other things in.,2
136391,I chose this awnser because in the picture of the earth it has the light bouncing off the glass acting as earth.,2
136404,"The earth seems to be reflecting the sun, but I don't know why.",2
136411,Because the atmosphere is like the glass because it can trap the heat,3
136400,The atmosphere reflects the heat back down to earth.,2
136460,The glass on the greenhouse gas acts like insulation by trapping the heat. The atmosphere is doing the same thing by trapping or stopping the heat from escaping. ,3
136476,I think the atmosphere is most like the green house gases because the atmosphere lets the suns raise in and then does not let it out.,5
136462,The Atmosphere absorbs some of the suns radiaon rays. Some of the rays leave the atmosphere to go into space. The energy that traps in the atmosphere are being used. ,5
136504,I think it is the atmosphere because like the atmosphere it is made of different types of gasses .,2
136500,I said this because it is like the plastic wrap. It holds in the gas.,2
136490,the atmosphere in the earth picture shows the glass as the atmosphere and the inside of the greenhouse is earth.,2
136505,"The glass is like the Earth because it is the part that reflects and absorbs the suns light, and heat.",3
136509,The Eath asorbs heat and reflrts heat.,2
136519,The sun shoots sun rays and makes the greenhouse hot because of sun rays but the heat cant get up.,4
136495,"The atmosphere is like the glass of the greenhouse because it lets in heat, but doesn't let as much out.",3
136550,"The atmosphere is above the earth, like the glass, it also has the ozone layer which absorbs light, almost like the glass, it also does let light in like the other layers.",3
136572, The atmosphere is trapping the heat and reflecting the sun to the earth. ,3
136557,"The imaginative line is the atmosphere because the atmosphere is like the glass, the Earth is like the plants, the sun is the generator, and space is just where heat travels.",2
136563,the atmosphere traps heat in,3
136518,"I think it is the atmosphere because like the atmosphere it is made of different types of gasses. The greenhouse will absorb some heat and reflect some heat like the atmosphere. The atmosphere is like the glass of the greenhouse because it can absorb light. Also, the greenhouse will absorb some heat and reflect some heat like the atmosphere.",3
136381,"The atmosphere is like the glass of the greenhouse because in picture A the heat goes in, and when it bounces off the objects inside, the glass reflects the heat, and the heat is stuck in there. The atmosphere is doing the exact same thing.",3
136359,I choose got this answer because the the sun goes start through the glass and the sun also goes straight through the atmosphere just like the gas.,3
136372,"The atmosphere is like the glass in the greenhouse because the glass if covering it, like the atmosphere, and the glass if preventing too much heat come in like the atmosphere.",2
136382,"It is like the atmosphere because it lets heat in and traps the heat that does come in, but it also reflects some heat. Just like the glass on the greenhouse.",4
136683,because the light tranfurs from both of them and dose not let then esape,4
136390,I think that the atmosphere is like the glass of the greenhouse because it is acting like a reflector and reflecting the sunlight. The greenhouse glass is acting like a shield reflecting the light and heat. Same as the atmosphere.   ,3
136388,"The atmosphere lets some sun in like the glass and keeps it there because it reflects off the Earth, back to the atmosphere and back to Earth.",3
136362,The glass is like the protector it is around the greenhouse gasses SO in the picture the atmosphere is the glass. It kepps in the greenhouse gases otherwise they would just move so much and not stay in there.,2
136374,Because some light is being reflected and some is being absorbed. ,3
136380,The atmosphere is like the glass of a greenhouse house because it is keeping the heat inside the earth like the glass keeps the heat inside the greenhouse. It is also like a little covering over the earth just like the glass,3
136378,The Atmosphere is holding the heat in like the green house is holding the heat in.,3
136367,The sun rays because the sun is giving off heat into the atmosphere and when that heat enters it try's to escape but its trapped in the atmosphere. ,3
136352,"The atmosphere keeps i a lot of heat and light if it gets through to the Earth. Like the greenhouse, less light and heat will escape.",4
136360,sun because the sun is like the heat going into the oven and the earth is the oven taking in some heat and refecting some heat.,2
136379,Because it take in solar radiation and some is reflected.,3
6971,It shows that the Atmosphere is covering the earth so the sun can not reflected that mush in to the earth,2
136368,"So the glass of the greenhouse keeps the heat and solar radiation in, but so does the atmoshpere.",4
136364,the suns rays come down to Earth and hit the atmosphere and it changes when it hits the Earths surface.,3
136384,When the sun shines on the atmosphere some light/heat is reflected and some goes straight through heating the Earth. This is much like the greenhouse glass,4
136393,"The Atmosphere is like the glass of the greenhouse, as it lets the heat in, but only lets some out. ",3
136413,The sun is in both pictures and it also makes a big effect on the objects and things in both pictures.,2
136394,The Earth is like the greenhouse's glass because it is adsorbing and reflecting light.,3
136405,I think the atmosphere is like the greenhouse glass  because when the sun comes down and hits the earth the atmosphere traps the heat and stops from too much of radiation coming in. ,4
136423,"the atmosphere locks the radiation from the sun, in other words, making sure it doesn't escape. Just like the glass.",4
136398,The atmosphere acts like the greenhouse glass because it doesn't let the heat escape and it absorbs all the heat and the sun's rays.,4
136414,It is like space because it is outside of everything else. ,2
136408,"In picture B, the sun keeps going down until it hit the Earth and then bounces off and goes back into the atmoshphere.",2
136420,"the glass is making the heat inside reflect back to the plants, the atmosphere is reflecting the heat back to the earth.",2
136419,"The greenhouse glass traps the heat inside of the greenhouse, just like how the atmosphere traps heat inside of the earth.",3
136424,It is like the glass because it lets some light in and keeps some light out.,4
136392,"The atmosphere will keep the light in the Earth and atmosphere keeps things in place like oxygen and will absorb the sun's radiation, energy or light and will keep it in from the atmosphere.",4
136426,because the sun is sending down rays which are bouncing all over the place.,3
136685,It is like the atmosphere because it lets in some light and reflects some too.,4
136403,"The part of the picture that is like the glass of the greenhouse is the atmosphere, because the suns energy is coming through the greenhouse glass just like the suns heat comes through the atmosphere and heats up the Earth on picture B. ",3
136422,I think that its the sun because the sun's heat gets in the greenhouse and then reflects.,2
136416,it reflects most of the heat but not all of the heat,2
136425,"It is like the sun because it is getting trapped in the greenhouse and making it hotter. When the molecules get trapped, it gets hotter because they are moving around everywhere.",2
136395, The glass retains the heat that is absorbed into the greenhouse. The atmosphere retains the heat that is reflected off of Earth's surface. These jobs are similar.,3
136474,The atmosphere reflects the light and heat inside like the glass of a greenhouse.,3
136467,The atmosphere acts like the glass because it is reflecting the heat back to the Earth creating a convection current.,2
136463,The atmosphere is like the glass from the greenhouse because it traps the heat like the glass.,3
136483,I said space is the answer because the space is reflecting the energy source to go back to the earth and heat it up.,2
136461,The light is absorbed making the Earth hotter and it acts just the same as the greenhouse gasses.,3
136465,The atmostsphere is because it is absorbing the light and traping it in. It is not letting any light out. ,4
136459,It's the closes thing to the radiation point.,2
136485,The atmopshere is like the glass because it conducting the sunlight from preventing it to leave with the sun's increasing temperature it's like the same thing as the solar panel that we did with our teammates.,4
136455,"Ont the Earth picture, the atmosphere is shown just above all the surfaces and just below all the surfaces. Also, the arrows are in and outside ",2
136453,The atmosphere is acting like the glass because it is conducting the sunlight and preventing it from leaving,4
136477,The earth is the one that is like the green house gases because it is reflecting off the sun.,2
136517,"I chose this because the rays have to get through them to get inside, and they stay under it unless they get get out.",2
136496,Parts of the atmosphere concentrate rays so that the ground gets the most light just like the glass.,3
136489,The atmosphere is like the glass since the atmosphere can trap the heat on the inside like the glass of the greenhouse. The greenhouse gases also keep the warm air or cool air on the inside.,3
136511,because its like the air  around the glass is absorbing the heat inside the core of the earth. ,2
136499,The glass of the greenhouse would be the atmosphere because it takes in the gases that are good for us and will reflect the gases that are bad for us.,2
136506,It is the atmosphere because it traps in heat and makes it bounce back to earth like a greenhouse.,3
136497,Because it is above the earth a little and it shows heat from the sun going in and not coming out.,2
136508,I chose the atmosphere because in picture B you can see that there is dots on the outside of earth that is the atmosphere.,2
141563,its earth cause there is plants and plants need to survive with oxegine.,2
136501,"The atmosphere is like the glass of the greenhouse because, the glass and the atmosphere will let some of the heat inside, but will not let some of the heat, leave/escape.",4
136493,The glass keeps heat from escaping and the atmosphere keeps ultraviolet rays from coming in.,3
136512,The atmosphere in the picture seems to keep the gases in earth and not outside of earth.,2
136503,This is because soloar radaition goes through the atmosphere and turns into heat.,4
136498,The atmosphere is like the glass of the greenhouse because it closes and keeps all the heat that comes toward to make the temperature increase. ,3
136520,,1
136494,"I chose the atmosphere because the atmosphere is basically the roof of Earth, letting Earth get heat from the sun.",2
136514,I chose the atmosphere because like picture A where it is showing a real greenhouse where light form the sun passes through the glass panels and heats the inside just like in picture B the atmosphere is another way of looking at the glass because all the sun is coming inside the atmosphere and from the earth it is reflecting out just like the glass and the greenhouse with glass panels.,4
136522,"The atmosphere is most like the glass of the greenhouse, directing the solar radiation toward earth and reflecting some of it. ",3
136558,Because heat goes right through the atmosphere. ,2
136567,The atmossphere gets the heat And reflects it also.,2
136555,The atmosphere keeps heat in just like the glass keeps heat in.,2
136571,The atmosphere is like a giant glass dome.,2
136551,the ozone acts like the glass of greenhouse ,2
136566,It looks the same because the SR can not escape in the greenhouse glass and the SR can not escape the atmosphere.,4
136549,"The atmosphere is like the glass of the green house, because when SR goes threw the roof, it hits the plants and UR light comes back, just like the earths atmosphere, and SR goes threw it and hits the earth, and comes back as UR light. I know this because on the wise project in 3.2 I think when we molded the green house gasses to guess are Hypotenuse we learned that green house gasses go threw objects and bounce back. ",4
136355,The glass of the greenhouse is like the atmosphere because because they both can reflect and absorb heat.,2
136492,I think this because the atmosphere is trapping the heat so it will heat up the place or thing it is hitting.,3
136361,The atmosphere is like the glass of a green house because the heat can come in but it is hard to get out. It also heats things up.,3
136354,It is like the glass because it reflects some and lets some in like the glass doses.,3
136387,The glass at the greenhouse gasses keeps the hot air in along with it allowing it to get into the greenhouse.  This is the roll the the atmosphere plays for the Earth.,3
136369,When the solar radiation reflects off of the earth one of the earths atmospheres  will keep it trapped on the earth instead of letting it go into space.,4
136351,The sun is like the glass because they both create heat.,2
136421,The Atmosphere does not let the heat out.,3
136397,"The Sun because, it shows how heat comes through the atmosphere ad the glass, but bounce off it and never gets out.",4
136412,the sun is because it shows how the greenhouse gassses bounce around but never get out.,2
136399,thw sun  will hit the crops making them grow,2
136402,In both pictures the sun is going either on to Earth or on the plants in the green house. ,2
136396,Because heat bounces of the sun into the atmosphere.,2
136407,The atmosphere traps the gasses like the glass does.,2
136406,In picture B it shows theheat or solar radiation hitting down from the sun and reflecting it like glass.,3
136417,The sun because it will heat up.,2
136410,because sun can go through it but not come out.,4
136409,,1
136450,The atmosphere will reflect most of the heat back onto earth. The glass will reflect the heat back into the house.,2
136451,Because solar energy is being absorbed and reflected just like at the greenhouse.,3
136468,I think the glass of the greenhouse is like the Atmosphere because it keeps our air in and it keeps the suns reflections from killing us and the suns reflection shines in the greenhouse and the glass keeps the heat in just like the Atmosphere.,4
136480,"The reason why is before anything, when try to get inside the earth you pass the Atmosphere. So the Atmosphere is like a shield that's protecting the earth. So if something does not belong in earth the Atmosphere sends it back off into space.",2
136482,The Atmosphere is the space between space and the Earth. Therefore making the heat stay within the Earth and the Earth Atmosphere.,3
136457,"The glass of a green house can let sunlight and solar radiation through, but it may be a bit difficult to let the heat and access light escape. That may be the same with Earth's atmosphere. It lets in solar radiation and light through. But once the light is reflected off the Earth's surface, I guess the atmosphere keeps it in. Or it may be heat instead.",5
136456,"Since the atmosphere is thicker than the air that humans breathe, it will help insulate the heat coming off of the Earth to escape, while the other side in space will let light come inside.",3
136454,"The atmosphere is like the green house glasses because it helps heat come in but, doesn't let it come out.",3
141561,It's like the atmosphere because in picture B it shows the Earth witch is the inside of the greenhouse and the next thing is the glass and the atmosphere so it is like the atmosphere.,2
136475,"The sun glass of the greenhouse will reflect all of the greenhouse.
",2
141559,well the Atmosphere keeps in the heat like the glass it keeps it in but rarely lets any in ,3
136481,The atmosphere is like the greenhouse glass because the sun rays pass through the atmosphere like the sun rays do when it passes through the glass of a greenhouse and it gets trapped and bounces off the earth's surface and back the the atmosphere and continues the cycle.,5
136469,I think the atmoseshpere is the glass for a greenhouse becauase it is letting heat in and heat out like the glass.,3
136507,"The glass of the greenhouse and the atmosphere both let controlled amounts of heat through and after it makes it's way through the atmosphere or glass, it cannot come back out again.",3
136502,I think so because once heat comes in it can't get out.,3
136515,Space because it is between eart and the sun,2
136553,because the earth is adsorbing all the heat,2
136583,The glass is like the atmosphere because it traps some of the heat from the sun.,3
136546,"The atmosphere reflects some sun and keeps in most, just like the glass in the greenhouse",3
136574,,1
136570,The solar radiation travels through space and passes through the atmosphere. When the solar rays pass through the atmosphere the rays get trapped and create heat. This warms up our planet.,5
136569,"When the solar radiation passes through the glass of the greenhouse, it becomes infrared radiation.It is very similar to what the atmosphere might do.",4
136580,I think that the atmosphere is like the glass of the greenhouse because you can see from the pictures that the sun radiation is coming in and out through out the glass at the top of the green house.,4
136564,"The atmosphere is most like the glass panels in the greenhouse because heat goes in, through the atmosphere, and to us humans, but it cannot escape or get out of the atmosphere once it comes again.  The greenhouse glass panels do the same thing. They hold heat inside the greenhouse so the plants can get warmer and grow.",3
136559,"If you look at the glass and the earths atmosphere, they both have a little sunlight going through. ",4
136561,,1
136576,i say the atmosphere because that is the layers after earth to keep us on earth and the glass like an atmosphere for the plants and for the air to stay in the greenhouse. and the glass stops the air from leaving well most of the air and the atmosphere keeps oxygen from leaving. So the atmosphere and the glass are like the same thing. ,3
136556,"I chose the Atmosphere becasue, like glass in a greenhouse, it prevents most light from coming in. ",3
136560,Because green house gasses reflect.,2
139536,"The atmosphere is the glass because it is the layer which has light coming in, but also has gases that Earth or the plants release trapped in.",5
139541,Sunlight passes through the atmosphere and heats the earth and it keeps the heat energy from escaping just like the glass panels.,5
139545,The atmosphere stops heat from escaping and lets the solar radiation come in.,5
139542,The glass in the greenhouse traps heat like the atmosphere trapping heat for Earth. ,3
139540,"The atmosphere is the top surface of Earth, and the glass of greenhouse is also a layer that sunlight would go through.",3
139866,"In the house, the rays go through the glass and into the plants. With the sun, the rays go through the atmosphere and go through the Earth.",4
139544,"The atmosphere is like the glass of the greenhouse because it allows heat from the sun to travel through the layer of glass (atmosphere) and whatever heat enters, the heat stays within the layer and cannot escape because it is being reflected back to earth.",2
139864,The atmosphere either traps or reflect the energy given off by the sun. ,4

139869,"I chose atmosphere, because it just floats around.",2
139847,The greenhouse keeps heat in and so does our atmosphere so they both have the same effect.,3
139879,,1
139853,The glass is like the atmosphere because it traps gases into the house. ,2
139747,It acts like a blanket; the first layer of protection.,2
139774,Atmosphere is like the glass of the greenhouse because it traps in heat.,3
153977,The atmosphere is like the glass because it lets the rays from the sun in but does not let them get out.,5
153978,The black line with white dots across the sky is working as the glass because they are both bringing the sun rays in and out.,4
153979,Because the sun is gong in the greenhouse and heating the plants then leaving to go back to earth.,2
153980,Because the sun's rays are hitting it then bouncing off.,3
153981,"Like the glass the atmosphere is allowing the sun rays to turn into heat, warming the earth. In the greenhouse's case the glass is what is allowing the sun rays to pass through, without the heat bouncing off and turning into infrared radiation.",5
153982,"I got my answer from the passage at the top, and that gave me the idea to select sun as my answer.",2
153983,the sun because the sun will come through the top and help the plants grow.,2
153984,"it is the earth because the green house glass wouldn't be space,sun,or the atmosphere",2
153985,"It is like the glass because, it is trapping the heat like the glass is doing in PICTURE A.",3
153987,i pick that because if you see in the picture it shows dot line,2
153989,I think this because the Atmosphere keeps people on the grow so heat would stay on the grow.,2
153991,The glass helps keep the heat in and the atmosphere has a lot of carbon-dioxide which helps keep heat in.,3
153992,Cause of the sun,2
153993,I think it's like the glass because the Atmosphere is kind of like the window.,2
153994,Some sun rays are getting in the atmosphere and some are not.,4
153996,I think it is a atmosphere because the sun and the earth are combined.,2
153997,the atmosphere because its like the roof of the world that helps it not get to hot,2
153999,It is the atmospere becuse it comes in but gets stuck in,2
154000,because the heat gets trapped in and can't get out.,3
154026,It is like the greenhouse glass because the heat is going in and it is not escaping.,4
154107,The sun because it is called a solar panel which attracts heat from the sun and goes inside of the building which heats up what ever is in there.,2
154108,"I think the atmosphere is the greenhouse glass for Earth because on the picture it shows the sunlight stopping at the atmosphere, and if the sun rays were to escape the atmosphere , it would create problems in the solar system.",3
154109,I think the atmosphere is similar to the glass of the greenhouse because the atmosphere is keeping the heat for leaving the Earth.,3
154111,I think the atmosphere is like the green house glass because the atmosphere takes in the heat but wont let it out like the green house.,4
154113,The Atmosphere is like a big blanket around the Earth and when the sun's rays come in they can't get out because of this big giant blanket in the way (the atmosphere) and the glass panels in the green house are like the the big giant blanket around the green house that let's the sun's rays out and not back in just like the Atmosphere does.,5
154114,I think this because if heat could get trapped like that then it could also reflect of the plants.,3
154115,The atmosphere because it traps in all the air/heat waves we get from the sun.,3
154117,"I chose Atmosphere because  the Atmosphere is surrounding us and it is also out  around the earth so in the picture it is like the glass that the heat energy is coming through. If it was space then  the heat energy might escape,the sun is circling around the earth but is not in one place like a big circle surrounding us,and it can't be the earth because that is what is inside of the thing surrounding the greenhouse and the heat energy.",3
154120,"In picture A we can see the glass being hit by the Sun causing the heat to stay into the green house. In picture B we can see that Earth being heated by the Sun causing the Earth to stay warm, just like the Sun hitting the glass on the green house.",3
154121,when the sun hits the glass it reflexs it and gets the heat on the plants.,2
154123,because the atmosphere traps all the sun light and gases that come in the earth atmosphere.,4
154125,,1
154126,I think its atmosphere because it looked like that the heat bounced off the atmosphere and hits the earth again,2
154129,The Atmosphere is like the glass because it reflects off the sun so a little will come through.,2
154131,Since the atmosphere is see through like glass The glass keeps the heat inside sort of like the greenhouse effect.,3
154133,why I said that the glass from the green house looks like the Earth because the sun's heat goes in the earth but does come out.,4
154136,I think that the atmosphere is like the green house because the atmosphere does not let the heat esxape from the atmosphere.,3
154137,The atmosphere is like a window because it doesn't let the air in a our Earth escape. It also keeps out the sun beams to actually burn us to death. I also picked the atmosphere because it is basically a window but for our planet Earth.,4
154138,Because the atosphere has like a force wall that blocks the air from leaving,2
154139,the atmosphere is like a thick blanket and helps keep warm air get trap.,3
154142,My answer is that atmosphere is like the glass in the greenhouse because the atmosphere covers the earth and the glass covers the greenhouse.,2
154149,the atmosphere is like glass but things can fall through it. it's cause the atmosphere and down is air.,2
154154,It would be better to put them inside a small glass house because there can be animals that can try to eat them so I would put them inside because it's more safe inside the small glass house.,2
154156,The atmosphere traps the energy.,4
154302,the atmosphere looks like the glass in the green house,2
154304,i think its the atmosphere because it surrounds the earth just like the glass surrounding the plants inside the green house,2
154306,"As the atmosphere does, the oven traps the heat inside to heat whatever is in there.",3
154308,"The atmosphere is going to trap all the air as the ozone layer is there for that reason ,nowadays since there are gases such as carbon dioxide.",2
154309,The Atmosphere is like the greenhouse because it reflects heat so our world doesn't fry like a marshmallow.,2
154312,its like the earth because it reflecks back.,2
154313,The atmosphere usually lets out excessive heat but carbon dioxide keeps the heat in is it can't escape.,3
154314,The Atmosphere traps heat from the sun like the glass from a green house,3
154315,Earth because that is where the greenhouse starts and happens.,2
154316,It is like the glass because it is not letting the heat escape.,3
154317,Its like the one in space because its shooting out beam of light back.,2
154320,"The atmosphere is the line around earth, kind of like the last boundary with gravity, and the atmosphere filling with gasses acts like a boundry between the gravity and the no gravity, so when the sun comes into that, it is hard for it to break free if the gravitational boundry to push out of that, acting like a green house going back down. that is what the atmosphere does and why it is my answer",2
154328,I think the atmosphere because it looks like the sun is going right down.,2
154331,My answer is earth because earth takes heat in and it can reflect heat away and it is like a mirror and it reflects it off like how your reflection goes off the mirror.,2
154333,Because they both have something that has to do with the question more than picture,2
154334,the green house is earth becouse we have lots of plants,2
154339,It's like the sun because the hot air can't escape from the structure.,3
154340,it show sun glowing at the plants.,2
154341,It is the sun because the sun is gloowing on the plants.,2
154344,I chose Earth because the Earth traps in heat from the sun to keep the planet warm.,3
154346,I luck the pichar and luck a sun,2
154347,you can tell because there is a little pict,2
154846,the atmosphere is most like the glass of the green house because it is letting light into the earth like glass in the greenhouse,3
154847,I think the atmosphere is like the glass of the green house because it holds in the Earth's air and acts as a sort of barrier.,2
154914,"It is because the atmosphere is what is letting the solar rays in, but not out, just like greenhouse glass.",5
154915,It is like that becaues it makes it so no radaid hits earth,3
153978,In both pictures the sun/atmosphere is bringing the sunlight onto the plants.,3
153979,because the sun will reflect on the sun  and heat the greenhouse.,2
153982,The sun in both pictures are both yellow and the sun goes in to the green house like the sun goes on to the earth.,3
154914,It is the outer atmosphere because it is the thing that keeps most of the heat/energy inside the Earth's atmosphere and surface.,4
153991,Carbon and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere act like Plexiglas letting light in and some light out.,4
154107,I think the earth because it shows in the picture that there are arrows reflecting off of it.,2
154117,"I picked the atmosphere because the sun is the heat, the earth are the plants and space is surrounding all of the stuff.",2
154126,I think the glass for the greenhouse is like the atmosphere in the sky reflecting the light back to the plants or earth.,3
154111,It keeps the heat waves inside the earth.,3
154108,"The atmosphere is like the greenhouse glass because like how sunlight goes through the glass, sunlight also goes through the atmosphere and onto the Earth, and it can't go past the atmosphere.",5
154133,I picked  the sun because the heat of the sun was in both pictures on earth.,2
154113,Because the Atmosphere is like the glass panel of the greenhouse.,2
154120,In picture A shows the sun hitting the glass of the green house and in Picture B  the Earth  is being hit by the sun.,2
154137,The atmosphere is like a window because the atmosphere keeps out the sun beams out of our planet.,3
154154,because the sun can get hot faster and the atmosphere to but,2
154114,Its atmosphere because the atmosphere would reflect the sun into the earth and heat it up.,2
154121,the sun will reflect of the glass,2
154131,I chose atmosphere because there is a blanket surounding the earth and its invisible like glass.,2
154125,so the heat gose in,2
154123,because it traps the heat inside so it wont escape,3
154313,Because the atmosphere lets out extra heat but carbon dioxide keeps in the heat so it doesn't escape.,3
154315,Earth because that is where the green gasses come from and enter into space.,2
154304,the glass is like the atmosphere because it lets heat in but not out.,4
154704,"The atmosphere lets the sun rays in, but the sun rays that bounce off the earth, reflect off the atmosphere and heat up the earth.",4
154303,"I think the glass of the green house is like the Earth's atmosphere because the atmosphere acts like a dome around the Earth that keeps the Earth's natural production of heat (sun) inside the Earth and stays inside the Earth. And so the glass in the picture in on top of the structure acting as a roof, sort of like the Earth's atmosphere is acting as a roof for the Earth.",3
154309,"I think it's the atmosphere because the atmosphere let's heat in and prevents heat from leaving. That's what happening in global warming. The atmosphere is trapping to much heat, and the globe is slowing warming up. That's what we want our solar oven to do, but not our world.",4
154316,Its like the glass because it holds in enough heat and lets some out.,2
154312,The heat goes through but it wont come out.,4
154302,I think the picture looks like there are plants in a green house and there are heat waves going into the green house to keep the plants alive,2
154314,The atmosphere traps heat from the sun and carbon dioxide. Like a greenhouse.,3
154317,It looks like the green house because the sun beams are shooting,2
154320,"The atmosphere acts like a greenhouse, trapping in the heat and letting out some of the heat as well, the atmosphere acts like that, well at least i think  that, the atmosphere of earth with the gravity has a barrier against the non-gravitational area, makes a barrier kind of like glass, and all of the gases we put into the air make the barrier harder to escape",3
154344,It is the sun because the sun goes through the green house and heats up the inside of the green house.,3
153997,the atmosphere because it like the ceiling of the earth.,2
153989,I think this because the glass acts like the atmosphere by bringing in heat.,2
154000,because the heat gets in but can't get out,4
153987,it is the atmosphere becaues it warms the air,2
153981,"The atmosphere is like the glass in the green house because when the sun rays travel through it, they become heat. When they rise up into the air, they can't escape because the atmosphere is holding them back.",5
153980,"I picked atmosphere because like the glass it lets heat in, but it won't let it out.",4
153996,The sun is the the top because there a light and the sun comes from the top.,3
154026,"The atmosphere acts like the glass because it lets heat in,  but doesn't let it out.",4
153985,"It is the atmosphere, because the atmosphere acts like glass and reflects the heat or the sun's rays around the Earth.",3
153999,The atmosphere is like the glass in the greenhouse both make it so the heat does not escape to heat up the earth.,3
154138,Because sun heats it up.,2
154115,It's like the atmosphere because the glass traps the heat from the sun in and the atmosphere doesn't let the heat from the sun leave the Earth.,3
154142,The atmosphere is the the glass in the greenhouse because it keeps the heat on earth.,3
154109,The glass of the greenhouse is like the atmosphere because when the sun reflects it stays in the glass and the atmosphere.,3
154346,because you can see the rays of sun and a like reflection on the glass,3
154306,Atmosphere lets the heat in like a greenhouse and heats up the earth.,3
154334,our earth is a green house it has plants all over the world,2
154340,I chose that on because the sun is reflecting of of the Earth.,2
154846,The atmosphere is either absorbing or reflecting the heat for the Earth just like the glass is for the greenhouse.,2
154149,it holds it in because of the oxygen,2
154129,I think this because it comes inside like radiation.,3
154156,The atmosphere traps the sun heats and the greenhouse is cover of sun heat.,3
153995,I chose the atmosphere as the glass of the because in the picture there is an imaginary line while the sun is going through it and going to the earth.,2
154915,The atmosphere makes stuff not get in like a astroyeb.,2
153983,I say atmosphere because in the second picture the heat is coming through the atmosphere and getting trapped in the atmosphere and heats and warms up the earth.,3
153988,well the suns heat is coming into the greenhouse and the sun heat is also coming into the earth atmosphere.,3
153993,Well the sun streams into the atmosphere and the it bounces of the earth then gets trapped.,4
153992,cause it's really hot,2
153816,"The atmosphere is thick like glass, but still clear enough to let in solar radiation.",4
153818,"The atmosphere let light move freely. Light doesn't need a material to move, so it comes from space and hits the earth. Heat does, and so it can't leave the atmosphere quickly. This traps heat.",3
153822,atmosphere beause it looks like that sun is bouncing of on to he aatmosphere,2
153823,Atmosphere because it is like the earths roof.,2
153824,"Well, when the sun gives solar radiation out, it hits the ground, and then the atmosphere soaks"" it up  keeping the heat in the atmosphere.""",4
153826,I think it is this because the atmosphere stops at a certain point because their is no atmosphere in space.,2
153827,the atmosphere keeps hot air from coming out of earth.,3
153830,The atmosphere allows the energy to bounce back here and say here so we can stay warm. It acts like the glass because the glass keeps the energy in for the plants. The atmosphere keeps the energy in for the Earth.,3
153831,The atmosphere keeps the air in so it acts like the glass of the greenhouse.,2
153832,The earth is reflecting the suns rays.,3
153834,The atmosphere because it keep te heat and light in just like the glass at a greenhouse.,3
153835,I think that the glass is most like the atmosphere because the heat goes through the glass and then is tapped in whle on arth the heat hits the land then rises into the air,3
153836,"In the first picture doesn't show the Earth, Atmesphere, or Space.",2
153837,I think so because in picture B it looks like a big roof around the earth.,2
153838,i chose the atmosphere because they have the same gas an sun an heat,2
153843,the space looks like the glass the most because it is white and almost is see throught,2
153844,It would be the sun because that is what is giving the heat for the tomatoes to grow.,2
153848,I think the clear dotted line is the glass part of the greenhouse because it shows the sun hitting the dotted line and the sun hits the dotted line.,2
153852,Earth is like a mirror and it reflects when the sun is shining towards it.,2
153854,the heat  from the sun is warming up the house (like solar).,2
153856,Because space surrounds us aka earth.,2
153859,because the atmosphere trap the heat on the earth and the green house gasses makes the sun rays stuck in the atmosphere,4
153860,The atmosphere because it is what so,2
153863,Because  t shows that the glass iis space.,2
153864,The glass in picture A is like the atmosphere because it goes through it like picture A.,2
153905,"The atmosphere is like a blanket around the earth, or a roof over a green house.",2
153908,"The atmosphere because, the atmosphere is bouncing of some of the rays of heat and light.",3
153909,The  warm air is traped in by the atmosphere surounding the earth.,3
153910,It sorta protects the earth from really hot heat.,2
153911,if you look at the b picture it shows the sun rays hitting earth and then bouncing off over and over,3
153913,because it's going in and out the atmosphere.,2
153914,The earth is like the house and the sun is shining on to the earth through the dotted line that is the atmosphere. The atmosphere is representing the glass.,3
153915,they both have sun,2
153916,The glass traps the heat inside like the atmosphere traps in the carbon dioxide.,3
153917,i think this because earth can reflect the sun back to it,2
153918,It looks like the sunlight is shining of earth,3
153919,I think it is atmosphere because in picture B it shows the sun going into earth and bouncing back and the atmosphere containing it.,2
153921,I think the atmosphere because it is letting heat into to earth just like the glass is letting heat into the greenhouse.,2
153922,i think the atmosphere is acing like the glass in the greenhouse because it shows that the sun arrows do not go past the atsmosphere,2
153923,I think that the atmosphere works like the glass because it keeps the earth warm and it keeps it warm.,2
153924,because if we would  did not have atmosphere we would die,2
153925,the sun bounces of the earth,2
153926,the atmosphere is like the window because the light is coming in from the sun and hitting the earth (like hitting the plants).,3
153927,sun because the plants need to grow if we want to eat,2
153928,The atmosphere because it absorbs he sun's heat an it also keeps it inside like he greenhouse.,3
153929,The earth absorbs the sun witch is like how the green houses glass keeps it in.,3
153930,The sun reflects into the little shed.,2
153931,its because the earth protects like a glass,2
153932,Sun because the sun is the most inportet to the green hows,2
153933,I think it is the suns reflection and the greenhouse keeps the sun in and creates evaporation.,3
153935,I think the Earth because the Earth is non stop being hit by the Sun all day which causes heat which make the greenhouse very hot.,2
153936,sun because you need sun,2
154112,I think the sun because it is reflecting off the earth to make a little reflection.,2
154118,the atmosphere keeps out meteors so i thought that it wuold keep in heat,2
154119,I think it is atmosphere because it is surrounding the earth. The sunlight is hitting the atmosphere.,3
154122,cause of all he energy that enters,3
154124,The atmosphere acts like the glass in the geenhouse because the suns radiation goes right through it,4
154127,it's atmosphere because the sun and space are farther out into the universe and the Earth is closer leaving the only possible choice the atmosphere.,2
154128,"The atmosphere lets the sun rays pass, but is doesn't let them get out.",5
154130,it sun because it like glass.,2
154132,because the sun gives us warmth and energy.,3
154134,It is the atmosphere because it is the atmosphere in and around the Earth that impacts the temperature on our planet based on how close or far away our planet is from the sun.,2
154135,The atmosphere because it is full of air and it is keeping the hot air inside Earth,2
154141,It can't be the sun because that's what is projecting. It wouldn't be the space because that's whats around it.And the Earth is what the sun is at.,2
154143,its the peace of land that exists on earth,2
154145,The sun  because it lights the plants and there isn't space. the space wouldn't act like glass.,2
154146,I think it would be sun because it is talking about the sun hitting the glass,2
154147,The atmospher heats up like the green hous because shield is working like the solar pannels.,2
154148,Because the atmosphere is farther than the earth itself.,2
154150,the sun would make it fall of the stem and would break,2
154152,I think that is sun because the plants need sun and the greenhouse also needs sun for the plants,2
154153,Because the sun does not go out.,2
154157,"I think glass because if its really hot outside  it can be worm inside, unless if you have a cooler inside the room it will make the heat go away.",2
154160,I think the sun because it goes in side the greenhouse faster.,2
154162,the atmosphere because it is like the atmosphere is the glass and the earth is the plants.,2
154193,The earth gets the sun but it rebounds but he atmoshere keeps it in.,2
154194,The atmosphere consists of many layers that protect earth from UV rays and much more so when the rays get trapped most of them don't escape are protect layers. This is like the green house and its glass,4
154195,I think that the atmosphere replaces the glass because Earth and Sun both play a different part in the Greenhouse Effect. I don't think Space has anything to do with this.,2
154196,I choice this because gren is like the Earth,2
154197,The atmosphere is like the glass because the heat from the sun is going through it.,2
154198,In the B picture the heat bounces off earth and back out,2
154199,The atmosphere because it is surrounding the earth like the glass that is around the green house.,2
154200,the sun hit both the earth and the greenhouse,2
154201,The atmosphere goes in and out on both of the sun and roof of the greenhouse to keep them running.,2
154202,The answer s the atmosphere because the picture shows the area between land and space.,2
154204,it is the sun,2
154205,The earth takes that sunlight but sometimes all of the sunlight shines on the earth like the greenhouse.,3
154206,The sunlight gets hotter when it passes through the atmosphere like when light passes through glass.,3
154207,The sun because it shows the sun on the earth and on the other picture it shows the heat going into the greenhouse,2
154208,The atmosphere seems to keep the different types of radiation in and create heat.,5
154210,It is he atmosphere because the Atmosphere collects heat and traps it inside.,3
154211,the heat can go into he atmosphere but can't leave. That is the same with the green house. It can go through the glass but can't leave.,4
154212,i think this is like the glass is the green house because the sun is bouncing of the earth and that also happens with the glass in the green house.,2
154214,The glass is like the sun in the in the picture because the suns rays hit the glass and the glass projects sunlight to the plants,3
154215,i think the atmosphere because it will help the plant stay alive more.,2
154216,The atmosphere because the atmosphere provides the air.,2
154218,well the sun helps the plants that are in the greenhouse grow and form.,2
154220,i dont know,1
154221,when he air from the atmosphere enters earth the air gets thicker.,2
154224,Sun because that was the best answer.,2
154226,"It shows the sun giving and getting energy from the green
 house",3
154228,because it has a green house and it has plants.,2
154307,I think sun because the sun grows there the glass and helps the plant grow.,2
154318,i think the sun because in order for the plants to grow you,2
154319,"the atmosphere is what keeps good air that we breath from excaping so I bet, the atmosphere keeps out most of the radiation",2
154321,I think it is space because space is the closest thing other than the sun to the plants.,2
154322,i think atmosphere because it is surrounding the earth.,2
154323,the line is the roof,2
154324,The sunlight comes through the glass which then gets the sunlight to the plants.,3
154325,"The atmosphere is like glass, it lets sunlight enter and will let little of it out so that way the earth is not cold and a block of ice.",5
154326,the Atmosphere keeps the warm air from escaping.,3
154327,the atmosphere keeps in the air.,2
154329,Sun because it looks like the glass,2
154330,"because , the sunlight can go through the glass , and will go on the plants to hear them .",3
154335,The sun will heat up the glass to keep the hot air inside the green house so then you can grow your plants.,2
154336,becues it green .,2
154337,The glasses are being hit by some energy source and the earth is also getting hit like the earth.,3
154342,I think atmosphere because it kind of like a protection dome that stays over earth.And it is like a window in a way.It is like a window because It could be meteor  coming towards earth and the atmosphere will protect it.On a rainy day your windows will keep rain out of your house,2
154343,i picked earth beause the suns rays come to earth,3
154345,I think its the sun because a greenhouse is green and the sun make it more green.,2
154353,the sun brings heat,2
154371,The air gets stuck in the atmosphee.,2
154514,"the atmosphere because the glass panels reflex the suns energy and reflex it back the atmosphere does the same thing it is like a panel but bigger that's how we are protected from the sun the, we are like the tomatoes and the atmosphere is are panel its kinda like that",3
154703,I think that it is the atmosphere because only the SR comes and go,3
154155,"the atmosphere acts like the glass, because tthe sunrays go throught the glass, as it does throught the atosphere",4
154151,no,1
153824,"The atmosphere acts like the greenhuse's glass because the suns heat hits the ground, the ground acs like reflective panels, and then the atmosphere sends that heat back down to the Earth, creating a cycle.",3
153822,i think atmosphere because the sun reflects off of the green house and the atmosphere is the suns energy around us so there the same because the sun and the suns energy are the same between the two.,3
153844,Well i think it would be the earth because the glass is trapping the heat and it is being exposed to the heat.,3
153852,"Earth because i's the same thing as glass, if a light hits Earth, the light will bounce just like a mirror, and glass.",3
153838,I chose the atmosphere because the  sun is  reflicting off the glass.,2
155053,The atmosphere is lie glass for the earth to keep heat inside of  it.,3
153831,Atmosphere because it reflects the heat back to earth.,2
153816,"Atmosphere contains air and keeps in, being warmed by sun",3
153823,Atmosphere because it is ugly like the earths roof.,2
153837,The atmosphere is like the roof of a greenhouse because for both photos heat cells are bouncing off the atmosphere and greenhouse roof.,2
153864,the glass on the green house is what the sun rays are going through in the earth picture the atmosphere i what is the sun rays are going through  so it is happening to both also the line around the earth is the atmosphere so that is also why.,4
153923,I chose the atmosphere because the atmosphere protects us like the glass protects the greenhouse.,2
153928,The atmosphere because it takes the suns radiation and it the earth will either reflect it back out or absorb it. When like in the greenhouse the glass will take the suns radiation and the plants will either absorb or reflect the sun rays.,3
153909,That atmosphere is like the greenhouse because it creates a air blanket which traps the sun rays in while still letting other sun rays come in.,5
153913,because the atmosphere reflects to the heat to bounced off of it to give heat.,2
153917,i think this because the sun shines in and stays in there,4
153916,The atmosphere lets sunlight in and traps the heat inside making the earth warmer.,5
153935,I picked the sun because the sun is constantly hitting the glass which makes the room a lot hotter.,2
153922,the atmosphere is like the glass on the green house,2
153921,Heat is reflecting of it just like heat was reflecting of of the tin foil flap.,2
153911,if you notice half of the sun rays bounce of earth and sme go in,3
153930,The sun reflects off the earth.,2
154112,I choose atmosphere because it sorta protects the earth from really hot sun.,2
153926,I think the atmosphere is the glass because the heat rays are going through it and hitting the Earth (plant).,4
153908,The atmosphere acts as the greenhouse where light passes through it and heats up the earth.,4
153905,"The atmosphere lets radiation in, but makes it more difficult for the heat/radiation to escape. It acts as a sort of blanket, just like the atmosphere.",5
153918,well in picture a the roof  glass and the sun hits the plants which bounces off and in picture b the sun hits earth and bounces off and hits the atmosphere like the roof in picture b,2
153906,Sun because its  directing its rays into the plant.,3
153919,Its is the atmosphere because it shows in the picture that the glass in the greenhouse is letting radiation in and letting little radiation out just like the atmosphere in picture B,5
153914,"In the picture of the real green house, the light is shining through the glass, and the glass is trapping the light inside. In the picture of the green house effect, the light is shining through the ATMOSPHERE, and the ATMOSPHERE is trapping the light.",5
153927,because the sun will bounce off the glass and go in,2
154135,it is like the geenhouse because the atmophere is reflecting the heat back at the earth (aka) the green house,2
154124,The atmosphere is like the glass in the greenhouse because heat travels through it then gets stuck at the surface of the Earth.,3
154132,Because the atmosphere traps heat to keep our earth warm and it also protects us from meteors as it breaks them down.,3
154162,the atmosphere reflects the sun so it wouldn't get that hot.,2
154134,The atmosphere because the atmosphere in and outside of the Earth protects it and allows a certain amount of sunlight and radiation caused by the sun into the Earth.,4
154153,the sun hits the green house.,2
154118,the atmosphere lets sun come in and keeps the heat in.,4
154155,"atmosphere acts as the glass, because it acts as the barrier were all the radiation goes in.",4
154119,The atmosphere because it is the top of the Earth so it traps the heat inside of Earth. This helps the Earth not be too warm.,3
154130,it the atmosphere because it going to the sun and the space.,2
154150,the atmosphere is fragile. like glass so it would use as much heat,2
154122,The Sun or Radiation from the sun is like entering atmosphere,4
154127,I chose atmosphere because it is the part of the universe that lets some energy into Earth and reflects the rest of it.,3
154143,green is the land or mountain that has been created to get radiation and also it is convection,3
154128,The atmosphere is like the glass in a greenhouse because it lets the light get through it but it traps it and doesn't let it out once it is in.,5
154141,The atmosphere is like the glass of the earth because it traps the heat from the sun going into the earth.So the energy from the sun can't com out.,4
154145,It is the atmosphere because it acts like the glass in the picture and it makes the radiation heat the earth's surface.,3
154208,The atmosphere traps in heat and circulates it.,3
154202,The atmosphere's gases trap heat the same way a greenhouse's glass works to trap heat.,3
154193,The atmosphere lets the heat go inside but the heat cant leave because the atmosphere is blockng it from leaving.,3
154200,well the earths atmosphere keeps the heat from completely escaping the earth,3
154206,The atmosphere attracts and reflects heat like the glass does.,2
154224,I chouse this buacause that is what it's like in the real,2
154212,i think it is like the atmosphere because it is the thing that keeps all the air and heat in.,2
154214,because the atmosphere reflects heat all around earth and provides plants energy and animals and people heat.,2
154218,well the sun attracts glass because it will make it shine more and it will attract the sun and solar radiation.,3
154221,The sun comes through the atmosphere and then hits earth then comes back to the atmosphere.,2
154226,the sun's energy gose to the glass and the plants get their energy to grow.,3
154217,the sun is reflecting the sun beam of light will go throw the glass and the plants will grow in side and not in side,4
154199,The atmosphere is like the glass because the sun is in the atmosphere so it goes through and onto earth.Also what goes through the atmosphere goes on to earth.,2
154198,The heat was reflecting off the atmosphere back inside,2
154215,Because it comes and bounces back.Bcause one it bumps into something it bounces back.,2
154196,Because the sun has rays which hits the glass in the picture.,3
154201,The earth is the only planet in space that has radiation from the sun.,3
154205,The earth is absorbing some of the heat/sunlight but not all like the greenhouse.,3
154197,The atmosphere because the light is going through the atmosphere and the glass.,3
154204,It is the same because the sun just goes off the atmosphere like the glass.,2
154195,The atmosphere contains the sun's energy once it enters just like glass in a greenhouse. This is radiation.,4
154311,the  sun light bounces off and gose to space,3
154322,The atmosphere is like the glass of the greenhouse because the atmosphere is protecting or surrounding the earth like how the glass of the greenhouse is protecting or surrounding the plants.,2
154310,Its the sun because the sun gives the eat and the sun is going to absorve .,2
154327,"The atmosphere because since it is thick, the hot air has trouble going out of it.",2
154326,the atmosphere is the glass panels for the earth.,2
154324,"The atmosphere is keeping the heat in reflecting it back at Earth, the way a greenhouse would work.",3
154319,"I beleive this because the atmosphere is keeping the heat in not spce, the earth, or the sun keeping it inside or atmosphere.",3
154343,on both pictures the radiation enters but dosnt exit,5
154307,I think it is the sun because the glass looks like the sun is going in it.,2
154371,It is because the atmosphere show how the heat goes in and doe not get out,4
154353,the sun because it will keep the heat inside the green house,3
154336,beacuse the sun is reflecting off the green houes,2
154325,"Atmosphere determines how much heat should be inside the Earth, it keeps tempatures ideal for life on Earth and lets heat leave Earth too, but it could only be little heat.",2
154329,The atmosphere because it shows in pic.B that when the sun hits it it acts like the glass in pic.A.,2
154323,becuse the heat has to make it through,3
154345,The atmosphere blocks heat for comming in but some heat still go's to earths surface. And the glass does the same but it can hit more than just the surface.,2
154703,because the sun hits the earth and it kinda reflects,2
155334,because the sun goes into the atmosphere and captures  the suns heat and makes the green house warm and hot,2
153836,"The real atmosphere and the cover over the green house are both an atmosphere"" over the Earth. Both are letting in solar radiation and reflecting out solar radiation.""",4
153834,The glass is like the atmosphere because it lets heat/solar radiation but doesn't let it out.,5
153863,Because it is in between of both of each other.,2
153843,because the sun is coming throw the glass pannals but coming out of them,2
153826,The sunlight will exit the atmosphere once it has bounced off the earth.,3
153848,"In Picture A, it shows that the sun rays go through the glass. In Picture B, it shows the sun rays go through the atmosphere which then hits the Earth.",4
153835,"I think the atmosphere is most like the glass panels because the heat will hit the earth then bounce into the atmosphere and back onto earth, like how the heat travels through the panels then bounces back off the panels , but still stays in the greenhouse",3
153860,The atmosphere is what is surrounding the earth and if the sun is directed towards earth it will go through the atmosphere causing it to heat up.,2
153830,"The glass in the green house allows the heat energy to stay inside the structure while the heat bounces off the glass. The atmosphere keeps heat energy from the Earth, inside the Earth and the heat energy bounces off the atmosphere just like when the heat energy bounces off the glass of the greenhouse.",4
154514,the atmosphere reflects the suns rays of the earth like a mirror so us an the earth are like the plants in the garden and the atmosphere is the mirror the green house.,3
153859,"because it traps the
he at",2
153832,The Atmosphere is leting in only some light ad only leting out some light to it works just like a solar oven.,5
153854,The earth showed how it is collecting all of the heat givin of the sun and the glass on the green house shows it to.,2
153839,The atmosphere is like the glass of a greenhouse because it's what is surrounding the earth just like glass of a greenhouse surrounds a greenhouse.,2
153818,"The Sun produces the energy, so it isn't the glass.
Space doesn't matter, the question is about the Earth.
The Earth is like the box. It is the thing heating up.",3
153915,because the sun reflects of the glass,2
153925,those little lines is the atmosphere.and the refelections bounse off.,2
153912,its like a big circle and the sun hits us.,2
153924,because it  keep all of the air in side,2
153936,space becuase that why thy can git bigger,2
154148,Because the atmosphere takes some radiation and kicks the others out.,4
154152,i picked the sun because i think it brings a lot of Radiation.,3
154160,The sun because the sun is that heats up things.,2
154157,The sun because it goes through the glass to the plants.,3
154147,The atmosphere works like the window because the energy can get through it and heat up the inside and it also reflects off the surface.,4
154159,the atmosphere is like the glass.,2
154161,The reason I picked the sun because if you look at the picture you can see that the green house window you can see the sun coming from the window from the greenhouse.,2
154146,I think the sun because it will reflect faster.,2
154211,The atmosphere is the glass to the green house because heat can enter but doesn't leave.,2
154210,The atmosphere absorbs the heat and reflects it. The absorbed heat warms Earth up.,3
154318,because the sun isn't in earth it is outside of earth,2
149950,Because the picture shows the sun reflecting off.,2
149966,"When the Earth takes in the heat from the sun, but the heat will try to escape, so Earth atmosphere helps keep in the heat.",3
149972,The atmosphere is what keeps the heat in like the glass on a greenhouse.,3
149959,beacause the sun is the heat source  and the earth is like the glass panels on the green house,2
149953,I chose the atmosphere because it protects us from too much radiation and it's like see through glass.,3
149970,The atmosphere acts as a barrier from to much sunlight.,3
149590,the sun is helping growing the plants by giving them sun,2
149956,The sun is keeping heat for the green house which gets energy.,2
149961,it has the sun beaming in on it,2
149588,It is the sun because it's like it's reflecting off the glass onto the plants to make them grow.,2
149968,because the,1
149955,I think this because space will not let to much sun get past.,2
149967,it is pushing the sun through the glass,2
150648,It is earth because the glass on the greeen house is like the shell of the plants and the crust of the earth is like the shell of earth.,2
149965,The sun is putting energy on the plants but it's coming through the glass first.,3
149954,the atmosphere is like the glass witch makes thing worm,2
149962,the sun because it reflects off of the green house,2
149969,The heat is bouncing off the atmosphere.,2
149971,i chose it,1
150065,There is no colored thing there which probably implies that the line is probably air.,2
150066,I think space is the right answer because in space they have solar panels are heat transfer  stuff out there and it looks like the the greenhouse glass in the picture.,2
150074,The heat is passing through the glass like the heat passing through the atmosphere.,3
150076,I think the atmosphere is like the glass of the greenhouse because it has a tinted blue in it.,2
150073,The picture show how the atmosphere traps the sun like a greenhouse does,3
150078,The squiggly lines represent the sun rays.,3
150070,because it is the layer that keeps the heat in like the glass in the greenhouse and both have something that the heat goes on to,3
150072,"The sun is my answer because in picture A, something is reflecting through it, it picture B the same thing is happening with the sun, that's why I chose the sun.",2
150075,The atmosphere is like the glass because it lets heat in but not out.,4
150077,The space around the greenhouse is like the shield for it.,2
150069,The sun is the roof because the sun heats up the green house so that the plants can grow.,2
151162,the glass was a solar window and solar is sun.,2
150052,i think earth because this is where all the trees grow and where life is.,2
150067,because it shines on the earth,2
150063,"I knew it couldn't be Sun, Space, or Earth so I put Atmosphere.",2
150056,The glass of the greenhouse is like the sun because the sun goes into the earth and the glasses heat goes into the green house.,2
150061,I chose earth because the earth takes in the heat just like the green house windows.,2
150059,it is because it is mostly like that   in the way the it goes up and then down.,2
150062,It is the sun because both of the pictures have sunlight reflecting through the glass.,3
150064,The sun is like glass because the sun is shining on the glass.,2
150079,Because the earth can safe heat from the sun and gives the earth heat and warmth.,2
150053,it keeps the heat in,3
150054,"The atmosphere because since it is like an air bubble, the heat will bounce around Earth.",2
150055,The sun because it is the same thing as a hot place and heat .,2
150058,sun give the plat enegwr,2
150060,"Atmosphere is like the layer that protects Earth, and the green house.",2
150071,The sun because it flashes through the glass and makes it look like a picture.,2
150057,The sun seems to be bouncing off Earth like glass would do to prevent a house getting too hot.,2
150085,"I believe this because in Picture B"" the sunlight/heat was stop at the dotted line",3
150087,"I chose do pick the atmosphere because on the picture the atmosphere lock the closest to the glass in picture A"".""",2
150104,the atmosphere is like the blanket and it keeps the heat in side the earth,3
150101,I chose Earth because the sun rays are deflecting the Earth.,3
150105,"I chose the atmosphere, because it is the invisible layer of the air.",2
150109,The atmosphere is like the glass in the greenhouse because the atmosphere warms up the earth like how the glass warms up the heat rise.,2
150086,i cant explain it,1
150097,I chose sun because the sun goes right through the panels.,2
150114,the sun mack it growe,2
150094,because it provides the heat,2
150082,I think that the earth is like the glass because it shows the arrows going into the Earth.,2
150090,Because the atmosphere keeps the air in so we can breathe and a greene house glass keeps the hot air in so the plants can grow,3
150092,the sun is the main energy of a sun house,2
150113,the sun heat goes on earth ands if the corld is light the sunlight with the haet goes back if the corld is darck  the heat goes in if you have a swecter on it is like the heat is staying in the sweter to keep you warm.,5
150111,because i see sun,2
150112,because there's a line on the picture around the earth.,2
150096,i think it the sun puting all of the heat,2
150132,"It is the Atmosphere because the heat from the sun gets trapped in it, causing it to warm up our planet.",3
150133,I chose the atmosphere because the sun is shining light down on earth through the atmosphere.,3
150130,The atmosphere is like a giant greenhouse it keeps all the heat in kinda like how the glass keeps the heat in on a greenhouse.,3
150127,"I think the Atmosphere is the greenhouse because the radiation from the sun goes through the line"" of atmosphere just like the radiation from the sun goes through the greenhouse's glass pannels.""",4
150117,I pick the Atmosphere because if we didnt have the atmosphere then we wouldnt have air. it would just escape into spave,2
150115,Sun,1
150124,The atmosphere is a layer that traps all the heat  from leaving earth.,3
150131,"After the sun rays bounce off the earth's surface, it bounces upward and stops before it gets to space and before the sun.",3
150134,I picked the atmosphere because it is showing the air that the sun beams are in,2
150145,the atmosphere is keeping the sun from getting out to space,3
150137,"I chose Atmosphere because it is keeping it in not he earth because it is on the inside like the plants so the Atmosphere is more like the glass for that reason the sun cannot be it because it is not around"" the earth and space does not have a type of gravity on earth that can keep the radiation inside the Atmosphere.""",4
150149,"Just like the glass on a greenhouse, the sun is reflecting off of earth's surface and going back to the sky. Picture B shows the sun bouncing off of earth's surface.",2
150140,Earth collect heat because it could make the inside of it hotter and to release infrared radiation from the lithosphere.,3
150122,"Its the atmosphere because it acts like the glass of the greenhouse the most. It act like the glass of a green house by having light and heat go through it, however it dosn't let the heat escape.",4
150123,"The atmosphere because the atmosphere is like a blanket that traps all the heat, so it won't get out.",3
150138,The oleny way is the sun.,2
150136,"It seems as though the sun is beating down onto the earth, and reflecting back into the atmosphere displayed in the digital drawing.",2
150142,it looks like it would be a sun roof,2
150125,The energy is trapped in the atmosphere because the energy is right around the atmosphere.,4
150116,"The atmosphere is like the Earth's glass, it does not let the sun light escape.",4
150148,sun enters places such as how heat beamed off the window glass,2
150128,The atmosphere is like the greenhouse because the both direct sun rays.,3
150144,you get heat from the sun,2
150516,I chose the Earth because it shows the heat from the sun going on to the Earth,2
150121,beacuse earth is a solid thing and the atmosphere was the shield to the sun to protect us from getting us to much sun.,2
150143,This is because if you have sand touch something hot like the sun it will make glass.,1
150146,The atmosphere is like the greenhouse because it collects all the heat to the earth and around it . The line in space also proves it and the heat can not escape from it.,3
150195,Because in the picture it shows that heat is trying to escape but it only some makes it out and this like the greenhouse because greenhouses trap the warm air in.,3
150200,Sun because it show it on both pictures,2
150198,I think this means many things,1
150158,Because You see a heat wave in the picture and it uses light,3
150159,"It is the Atmosphere, you can tell bye looking at the A. greenhouse.",2
150153,the atmosphere keeps most of the heat from escaping earth,3
150162,"The glass is something that you can see threw, so, the atmosphere is just the SAME!",2
150173,the sunlight is all bouncing of something.,3
150164,The atmosphere is  keeping the energy from escaping.,3
150178,I choose this answer because the sunlight goes through the windows or glass.,3
150176,"It is shown how some of the sun's rays get past the atmosphere, just like the greenhouse's glass.",3
150166,Because the sun is shyny and bright.,2
150160,I chose atmosphere because space will just let the heat out.,2
150155,because it is not letting the convection escape,2
150172,It is very bright at the top,2
150163,Earth is like the greenhouse because it gets the suns heat and doesn't let it out,2
150157,because it is the same coler as the glass,2
150174,It looks like it because it is very light.,2
150154,I think that the Sun is like the greenhouse because the heat of the sun goes right in the glass.,3
150167,The atmosphere is like a glass wall it secures the earth making sure only light comes in but its very fragile.,4
150194,Because it  passes through it like glass to a greenhouse.,2
150168,I chose atmosphere because in the picture the the circle around the Earth in the seven layers of Earth's atmosphere.,2
150170,"i think it is the atmosphere because space is infinite,earth would be the plants, and the sun is the energy for the plants it helps them grow.",2
150199,"I choose the atmoshphere because if there was no atmosphere then the light would come right threw earth, but the atmosphere protects earth.",3
150196,sw,1
150156,sdjvakk.fhub,1
150243,The Earth is like a glass of a greenhouse because it traps hot air and sometimes deflects it.,3
150204,I choose this answer because the light and heat has to travel through space to get to Earth in the first place.,3
150244,The sun goes through the glass and keeps bounceing back and fourth and hitting the plant.,2
150219,"I chose that the atmosphere is similar to the glass of a greenhouse because it collects heat, but keeps it from escaping.",3
150231,BEacuse the sun is refleting of of the green house.,2
150236,The Atmosphere because it attracts the sun.,2
150246,I think atmosphere because there is nothing there and its like invisable like glassss.,2
150240,"The atmosphere is like the glass because the sun gets captured in the glass, and doesn't let the sun rays out. The atmosphere keeps sun rays trapped within too, making the earth warm enough with plenty of sun.",4
150242,The picture shows lines around the atmosphere look like there is a roof above Earth. In picture A the roof is glass. So the roof on picture B is glass.,2
150218,The sun because the heat from the sun goes in the green house,2
150226,I think its the sun because  that is the heat source,2
150208,The atmosphere is like the glass on the greenhouse because it acts like glass around the earth and the sun gets hotter while it shines onto the lithosphere.,2
150235,"Light passes through the atmosphere like the glass, then keeps it from leaving, like the glass does.",4
150220,It is the atmosphere because the atmosphere is what protects earth from heat like the sun.,2
150228,it is covering the earth from touch the suns reflectoin,2
150223,The atmosphere is like the glass because it lets heat come in but does not let it escape earth.,3
150205,i said the sun because the sun is giving sunlight to the plants.,3
150230,the atmosphere is the sphere that is all the air wich is why the heat is staying inside the atmosphere.,2
150249,The lithosphere were we live is like the inside of the greenhouse and the atmosphere is the glass.,2
150203,Their is  a part that prevents it from happening.,2
150248,I picked this because it is at the exact place.,2
150237,the sun comes in the same way,2
150241,I chose atmosphere because the glass lets air in just like the atmosphere does.,2
150221,The atmosphere protects Earth and keeps all of the heat inside of Earth.,3
150206,well the ground gets lots of heat source and the glass gets lots for your plants,2
150247,because its not letting go of the light,3
150215,becus the arow is from the sun to the green house,2
150239,atmosphere because it shows itself blocking the sun a little from the earth.,2
150207,The Earth is absorbing the sun like the greenhouse roof.,2
150238,The sun will heat up the plant and protect them from cold air sometimes.,2
150214,I think the earth is like a green house because it does not let the heat escape .,3
150202,It's like the outer layer.,2
149590,it is like the glass because it protects the earth.,2
150648,atmoshphere because it is like and outer blanket for the earth just like the glass in the green house.,2
149953,I chose the atmosphere because it keeps the energy from ecaping.,4
150071,Because the atmosphere is all around you.,2
151162,It looks green so does the earth.,2
150067,because once it hits the atmosphere it will heat the earth,2
150134,I picked the atmosphere because it has the line in picture b that shows the atmosphere.,2
150123,"The glass keeps heat in and bounces it around. The atmosphere does the same, but to the Earth.",3
150128,THe atmosphere is like the greenhouse glass because it keeps heat energy from escaping.,4
150136,"The atmosphere seems to be blanketing Earth itself, and reflecting it back to the Earth before it reflects the heat back into the atmosphere.",2
150122,The atmosphere is like the glass because it lets the heat go through it but it does not let the heat escape.,4
150135,I chose atmosphere because the atmosphere is getting all the sunlight and in is shining to the green house and the heat can not espape.,5
150231,it si getting heat from the sun.,2
150247,because the atmosphere is letting the sun rays through,4
150215,it is like the plastik rap,3
149959,because the dotted line is the atmosphere and the sun rays are shining through the atmosphere,4
149970,the atmosphere lets some heat in and some out like the grass.,3
149967,the atmosphere has pull on the planets.,2
149957,the atmosphere has gases that bounce back the rays and the ray go through and might not go out.,5
149961,It bounces the sun light off it,3
149954,the atmosphere is like the panels that keeps the rays of sun make the tempurater iikiiiiI,3
150073,The atmosphere is like the glass because it limits how much sun is coming to Earth.,2
150078,The atmosphere reflects the sun rays like the glass does,3
150077,The air around you will either push you or pull you depending on how strong the air is.,2
150062,Atmosphere is like the glass of the greenhouse because the sun is reflecting outwards.,2
150076,I think Earth is like the glass from the greenhouse because the both of them reflect the radiation.,3
150130,The atmosphere is like a big pane of glass covering to the earth.,2
150115,It's the top layer of the greenhouse.,2
150149,The sun is going through the glass and getting into the warm greenhouse to give the plants light.,4
150125,The atmosphere is like a greenhouse because the atmosphere covers the land like the greenhouse's glass covers the plants.,2
150124,The atmosphere is like a greenhouse because it traps the gases.,3
150177,It is because space is on the outside of the earth,2
150178,The sunlight goes to Earth and the sunlight goes through the window.,3
150198,I think this because it has a glow wich the sun has to.,2
150175,I chose the sun because for picture a it was the the glass that was heating the green house up and the sun heats up the earth.,2
150161,The sun because it is hitting the tomatoe.,2
150196,because it atracks heat,2
150202,It is like the outer layer.,2
150172,Because heat goes into the glass from the sun so basically the sun is the glass,2
150226,It is the sun because the sun is beeming down from space,2
150204,The atmosphere lets the light in but does not let the heat out so it warms the Earth just like the glass to the greenhouse.,5
150223,The atmosphere is like the glass because it does the same thing as the glass does it blocks out harmful rays of sun but letting some of it in to heat up the earth.,4
150145,the atmosphere is keeping the heat from getting out to space.,3
149968,Atmosphere is like the glass of the greenhouse because the reflect and it is a thick layer.,2
149966,"The atmosphere bounces the sunrays back to Earth, like the glass bring the sunrays back to the plants.",3
149963,I think that space is like the glass of the greenhouse because the layer of air covering the earth doesn't let the sun light from the sun get out of that layer of air.,4
149586,its because it is out.,2
149958,The atmosphere in the picture is like the glass because it is not allowing heat to escape.,3
149589,The sun enters through the atmosphere just like a window.,2
149951,in picture b it shows how the heat bounces of and in picture a it shows the same thing,2
149588,Atmosphere because once it hits the atmosphere it will reflect off.,2
149956,The sun reflects from the glass keeping it warm. If you did not have the sun reflecting it would not get any heat.,2
149587,"When the heat from the sun goes into earths atmosphere it hits the ground, then some of it is reflected onto the atmosphere and then bounces back to earth again and that is what the glass is doing. When the heat enters the greenhouse it hits the bottom the some is reflected on the glass and then it bounces back on the table.",3
149962,The sun is hot. and when the sun touches the glass the glass will get  hot.,2
149972,"Like glass on a greenhouse, the atmosphere lets in heat and traps it.",3
149960,atmosphere because in the it bounces out of the green house.,2
150217,"I think it is the atmosphere because the atmosphere is more like glass then space, the Sun, or Earth, the atmosphere acts more like glass.",2
150065,There is no solid line which means the line in picture B is probably gasses.,2
150079,Because the atmosphere is keep the sun  by the earth like the green house is.,2
150061,I chose the atmosphere because the atmosphere traps in heat like the glass.,3
150060,"The atmosphere is like the greenhouse glass because it is the layer that protects earth, and traps warmth inside and doesn't let certain gasses into the Earth's air.",3
150053,I choose atmosphere because the green house glass acts like a shield to the green house  and the atmosphere dose the same thing but for the earth.,2
150063,The atmosphere prevents some heat from escaping the air and so does the glass.,3
150052,Its the atmosphere because its the one that is like glass and and makes the heat shine on here.,2
150074,"The atmosphere will trap heat inside the earth so that it can be heated up, it acts like a plexiglass sheet covering earth.",4
150055,the sun because it is hitting the ground and its making the heat go all over the place .,2
150064,the sun hits the atmosphere,2
150057,I didn't choose Earth because that would be like the plants since its the lowest object.,2
150056,The sun is like the greenhouse because they both let the heat come in.,3
150070,the apnoshere is like the glass because it is the layer that covers earth,2
150075,The atmosphere is like the glass because it lets warmth in but not out.,4
150054,The atmosphere acts like the glass because shows that the radiation can't escape from the atmosphere.,4
150058,the picture sows the earth as the galss boasing of the sun.,2
150111,because it is bouncing off like the top of green house,2
150108,84C,1
150082,The earth is like a reflector reflecting of the sun.,2
150083,I think earth because it kind of show's the sun bouncing off the earth.,2
150127,The atmosphere is like the glass because it is a layer (semi) blocking the Earth.,2
150117,"I think it is the Atmosphere because in picture B, it shows that the reflection of the sun is bouncing off the atmosphere. But the heat is still going to Earth.",2
150516,I picked the Earth because in picture a the suns heat is going in the greenhouse and in picture b the suns heat is going down on the Earth.,2
150137,The atmosphere is like the glass in the green house because it is putting radiation in from the sun and not letting as much come out just like the glass.,5
150133,The atmosphere is like the glass because the solar radiation is being trapped in the atmosphere and the atmosphere is preventing the heat from escaping.,4
150118,the glass trap heat in from the sun so does the atmosphere.,3
150121,why the atmosphere is that it is not earth or sun beacuse the sun is projecting light rays towards the example of earth and earth is just part of the green house not really protecting it the atmosphere is like a shield to us it helps us from getting to much sun and enough sun to help us stay alive like the plants.,3
150116,The atmosphere keeps in the sun rays from bouncing out. It is similar to the greenhouse effect which helps out plants.,4
150141,Because it traps some of heat from the sun,3
150120,the sun's light comes in and does not come out,5
150132,"The greenhouse glass has heat bounce of it once it's inside. The atmosphere prevents heat from leaving as well, over a period of time, all the heat does escape.",3
150167,Glass is a barrier whilst the atmosphere is earths border.,2
150168,Why I chose the third answer was because in picture B the seven layers of atmosphere is reflecting the sun's solar radiation.,3
150158,The sun is helping the plant and people to see,2
150173,The Atmosphere is like the glass in the greenhouse because the sunlight goes through the Atmosphere like in the greenhouse then it bounces of the Earth.,4
150162,"A green house needs light,water, and soil. So, I will get a cardbored box and but tinfoil on the sides og the box and fold the sides twords the bottem were ill tape the sides down facing the bottem of the box (A.K.A where the soil & the plant will be) then, i will put it outside and water it once a day.",2
150155,well some of the heat is bouncing of the earth just like how some of the heat is bouncing off the glass of the greenhouse.,2
150174,Because the atmosphere is on the outside of the earth.,2
150156,because injfd,1
150199,It shows in picture b the sun beating down on earth but our atmosphere is blocking some of that heat from earth so it does't get to hot.,2
150176,"The atmosphere of earth is shown reflecting some of the sunlight, just like how the glass of the greenhouse does.",3
150235,"the atmosphere, like the glass, lets in sunlight but does not let it out.",5
150241,I chose atmosphere because it acts like a cover of a greenhouse when it lets heat from the sun in but not all of it .,3
150207,Earth is like the glass on the greenhouse because it is the part absorbing the sun.,2
150206,"well the ground absorbs it and the glass does too, it  goes though the glass and thats what earth is doing too.",2
150221,The atmosphere is like the glass in the green house because like the glass it is keeping the heat inside earth to warm earth up.,3
150208,The atmosphere is like the glass because it acts like the protection around the earth which is the greenhouse.,2
150246,Its space because its like nothing just something floating.,2
150244,The sun is giving energy to the plants and is getting trapped in the greenhouse.,4
150249,The iside of the greenhouse is the lithosphere and the atmosphere is the the glass,2
150205,i pick the sun because it looks like the greenhouse is getting heat from the sun even the picture b.,2
155700,I think this because the Atmosphere is what gets the sun into the earth.,2
150228,because it keeps it from it,2
150218,The sun is going in the green house.,2
150242,The atmosphere shows a line that looks like a cover. The sun is sending light in and out of earth,3
150203,It is not allowing the heat to go out.,3
150240,"The sun is most like the glass of the greenhouse, because both the glass and the atmosphere allow the heat to pass through, but trap the heat, because the glass traps heat to give sunlight to the plants, and the atmosphere traps heat to give warmth and sunlight to the Earth.",5
150248,It is at the same place.,2
150237,because both heat look the same way coming in.,2
150219,"The atmosphere is like glass of a greenhouse because it lets radiation travel in, but then traps it in.",5
150220,I think the glass of the green house and the atmosphere do the same job because they both keep the radiation from leaving.,4
150243,The atmosphere is like the glass of the green house because it traps air inside.,3
150230,The atmosphere is what is keeping the heat and moist water in the world or greenhouse.,2
150222,the atmosphere holds all the heat in in so it does not bounce off .,3
150238,it could trap heat in maybe and not come out. so it will heat up everything.,3
150245,The Atmosphere is like the glass of the greenhouse because it is a layer of air that sort of covers the earth and protect it from getting to much heat.,2
150214,The earth is the glass because it going right into the earth.,2
150239,The atmosphere is like the glass from the greenhouse because its deflecting some of the cold air.,2
150236,The atmosphere because the heat passes through it like its glass.,2
150201,I think the atmosphere is the glass for the greenhouse because the atmosphere is a glass for us.,2
150197,I chose the atmosphere because it keeps in  the right amount of heat like the glass and the glass and atmosphere only let in the right amount of energy.,3
150163,the atmosphere is like a greenhouse because it grabs suns heat and light,3
150159,The atmosphere is outside just like the glass would be.,2
150160,I chose the atmosphere because space would just let the heat get out and we would all die because of the coldness.,2
150165,Earth because the earth has a core and a hard surface around it and if sun beats on that it will get hotter and hotter and it will go into the earth.,2
150154,The sun is like the glass in the greenhouse because the sun is reflecting on the glass.,2
150166,Because ht sun is shiny and its a hot thing and it helps things heat up.,2
150131,"The atmosphere is like the glass in picture A, because it is blocking the sun waves from going any farther.",3
150139,I chose atomsphere because when the heat tries to comeout of the atmosphere it just reflects back into earth.,3
150140,Radiation goes through the atmosphere so it could heat up Earth and to release the infrared radiation (radiation outside Earth).,3
150144,The atmosphere would trap the heat to warm the earth.,3
150143,This is because the earth is helping the greenhouse heat up like the sun does.,2
150129,the atmosphere is acting like the glass because the sun is shining on the glass so the atmosphere would be like the glass in the bigger picture.,2
150148,The sun shines down on earth and earth justs absorbs the heat.,2
150142,it looks like the earth's atmosphere,2
150138,the glass is traping the suns heat.,3
150126,the heat can't escape through the atmosphere.,3
150090,because the glass is a wall the lets the sun in but the atmosphere is also basicly aglass roof,3
150089,The atmosphere is like the glass in the greenhouse because the atmosphere is the glass and the ground is the plants in the greenhouse.,2
150098,This is because the glass is like the atmosphere of the greenhouse.,2
150093,I think the atmosphere because that is the outer layer and it is the layer the protects it.,2
150114,it will need the sun to grow,2
150086,i cant explian,1
150106,the sun is hot but when the glass in the sun are together it heats up hotter,2
150069,The sun is like the glass because both keep the heat in.,3
150066,I picked earth because earth also absorbs heat just like a and b absorb the heat for the plants and the earth.,2
150072,I chose Earth because it has many caves and holes and plants that the sun can go through.,2
150059,It is like it because they are both something that is before the actual inside.,2
149964,The atmosphere is like glass because it is a layer of Earth.,2
149950,The earth is the glass because the heat waves bounced off.,2
149955,I chose #3 because the atmosphere will let heat go in some it will just stay behind.,3
149947,The atmosphere shelters Earth.,2
149965,In picture B the sun is transfering the heat to earth. Picture A the glass is observing the heat from the sun.,2
149969,They both get and keep heat.,2
150650,I think this because the atmosphere does not let us fly into space and keeps us safe from the heat of the sun.,2
149971,eh idk,1
150153,the atmosphere prevents all the air leaving earth,2
150195,The atmosphere is like the glass because it lets heat through but it doesn't let it out same with the glass.,4
150194,Because the atmosphere traps heat on the earth,3
150164,The atmosphere increased the power of the sun rays.,3
150200,It is the sun because it is collecting it.,2
150169,it is like glass,2
150101,I chose Atmosphere because the small purple arrows are inside the atmosphere and going back into Earth into the greenhouse.,2
150105,"The atmosphere is like the glass in the green house, because it lets one the correct amount of heat in so we can survive.",2
150112,the atmosphere is like a glass shield but you can go through it so it akts like glass,2
150085,The glass of the greenhouse keeps in heat. It is also on top of the building. The atmosphere also keeps in the heat and is on top of the crust of Earth.,3
150094,the heat bounces off the earth,2
150109,The atmosphere is like the glass in the greenhouse because the atmosphere is like the glass that reflects the sun's rays.,3
150080,earth has all the heat,2
150097,the earth because earth traps heat.,3
150095,I put this answer because the garden in the picture captures heat and atmosphere does the same thing,2
150087,I chose thins answer because in the picture the atmosphere is were the glass on the other picture is.,2
150096,Because the sun have radiation and it would grow the plant.,3
150104,the atmosphere  is like the sheet of plastic that covers the earth containing the heat or warmth of the suns radiation,3
150092,sun has heat.,2
150897,space because the atmosphere effects every thing,2
150919,because the sun buants of the erth,2
150924,it takes the right amount of sunlight and the sunlight goes into the plant.,3
151186,It has a lot of detail,2
151195,because the water on earth is like glass so it gose though,2
151182,the atmosphere is like a glass from the zen garden,2
151180,I chose this answer because I want to.,1
150923,becausethe green house is on earth,2
151193,i dont know,1
151230,no se,1
151228,I think is they put the green grass the grass could be brown.,2
151217,A shows a real green house where light,2
151227,i think its space because it has all sorts of stuff,2
151218,i don't know,1
151209,i dot no,1
151213,The picture shows that the same thing happens like in the greenhouse.,2
151219,The sun will make it grow faster.,2
150899,I picked this because the atmosphere is just like the glass.,2
150900,Because earth is round.,2
150908,I choose this answer because glass is like the atmosphere but there is like a wall separating it.,2
150910,its going to hit off the su,2
150902,Because the picture shows that the Earth is with the sun.,2
150909,Because the picture with the plants are in Earth.,2
150904,the atmosphere absorbs heat.,2
150906,because the earth is like plants it needs sun,2
150907,"The Atmosphere creates the Green House Effect""By only allowing as much light as the earth needs to allow life and plants not get scorched.""",3
150905,The atmosphere is like the glass in a greenhouse because light can go through it and get bounced off of it.,3
151224,"The Atmosphere keeps all the heat from Earth escaping like the greenhouse glass, this happens because of the greenhouse gasses",3
151204,i chose this because the sun hit the green house .,2
151221,Because the sun is hiting the green house.It also hities the earth.,2
151222,In my opinion i think it is the atmosphere because,2
151212,I chose atmosphere because it shows the energy from the sun shining off the earth's atmosphere and bouncing of it.,3
151205,the radiation from the sun bounces off of the earth like the sun bounces off of the green house.,3
151216,The sun is going through the windows and the sun is going to the plants transfering energy to the plants.,3
151203,when its hot that means earth is not letting the energy go and if earth did then that is why it is hot,2
151215,There is always lots of lights in green houses so thats like the sun being there.,2
151223,Both the glass and atmosphere have sun passing through it.,2
151208,In the picture the atmosphere is like the glass because it  suck in   the heat.,2
151202,because the atmosphere looks like glass in the picture.,2
151206,The atmosphere keeps the heat in the earth like a green house.,3
151210,nose,1
151226,The sun is giving the energy to the plants in the green house.,3
151211,I think the because we are on earth,2
151220,"The Earth's gravity pulls the heat in and keeps it there, like the greenhouse.",2
151231,sun reflects on the glass to the plants,2
151207,I think its that because the atmospere has a line  and the heat was bouncing of the atmospere,2
151229,The sun is shing at the glass,2
151192,"In both pictures, you can see the rays of sunlight penetrating the glass.",3
151188,The atmosphere is like the glass panels because it traps the sun and keeps it here down on earth.,3
151178,"I would say the atmosphere because that is where the heat comes in, and where it comes out.",3
150915,The answers beside Earth are not similar looking to a greenhouse.,2
151199,the sun because it has reflected   the glass in  to a layer which has created,2
151191,the atmosphere is like a glass.,2
151196,the sun goez through glass,2
151200,I think this because the sun is heating the earth.,2
151165,I chose this  the sun because the sun  has  a lot of  energy .,3
150921,"In both pictures there is something stopping the heat from escaping. In picture A, it's the glass panels. In B, it's the atmosphere.",3
151194,i dont know,1
150922,the atmosphere is magnifying the light from the sun,3
150917,The atmosphere is the outer ring of the earth. So in the picture showed the light bouncing off a  ring outside of the earth so I took a guess that it is the atmosphere.,3
151176,it is between the sun and the plants.,2
151198,it is the outer layer of earth.,2
151174,i think it is the sun becaues there are arrows going through the green house,2
150918,"I chose this answer because the sun's rays hit Earth, and then the heat rises.",3
151190,the atmosphere is the same as the outside becasue both are clear,2
151181,I chose sun because it directly facing the grass,2
151201,the sun decreases,2
150916,the earth looks and works like an glass of the greenhouse. The greenhouse is the is the crust and the class is the lavas.,2
151179,Sun because the sun is shining through the glass,2
151225,i don't now,1
150909,Because you can see the yellow reflecting on it.,2
150902,I chose the sun because the sun is going into the glass and is hitting the plants.,2
150900,"Because the atmosphere is like a window, invisible(sort of) and let's out heat.",2
150910,Because the glass makes the sun to be attracted to the house.,2
150919,decause the sun is aming for the erth and the erath is poling to it.,2
150899,I picked the Atmosphere because the Atmosphere acts like glass because it traps heat.,3
150905,The glass in the greenhouse is like the atmosphere because they both let heat into something and they both can bounce heat off of it.,3
151216,Because the atmosphere is what is making the sun inpact on the glass.,2
151208,I think the atmosphere because the sun's energy reflects off the atmosphere into the earth's core.,3
151225,the sun shines on the glass,2
151229,the sun is shining on the plant inside,2
150917,The atmosphere at a clear force field around the earth to keep in the air. It also helps keep in the heat from the sun.,3
151190,the sun is facing the windows you can  even see the sun.,2
150921,The atmosphere keeps the heat in just like the glass keeps the heat in.,3
151176,They each have the sun going through them and they heat up the sun rays.,3
150918,"I chose this answer because  the atmosphere surrounds the sun, and is all around the sun. The sun's heat cannot escape from the atmosphere, similar to the glass of a greenhouse not being able to let the sun's heat escape from the greenhouse.",3
151179,Because just like the sun  is going through the glass it is going through the Atmosphere,2
151177,I think its that because heat is going through the glass.,2
151174,the sun is like the glass because it is going to earth and bouncing off,2
151200,I chose the earth because that is what the sun light is hitting.,3
151196,Its sun because you can see the sun shine down on the green house.,2
150907,The Atmosphere has a green house effect on the earth because the sunlight is coming through the A. like the glass on a green house and the green house glass is letting some sun out while the rest is staying in.,4
150908,The atmosphere because the glass is around the plant on picture A and the atmosphere because it is around a thing.,2
150906,because just like the glass in the greenhouse  the earth reflects the sun.,2
150903,I think so because they need heat and in a greenhouse and the sun produces heat.,2
151220,The atmosphere is the Earth heat trap.,3
151231,it reflects that so it can give sun to plants for food.,2
151209,i dot no,1
151223,The sun's heat radiates through the atmosphere while the heat radiated through the glass of the greenhouse.,3
151210,el sol es el gue da  fuersa,1
151181,I Chose the sun because it is the only heat source.,2
151182,Because it captures air made from tress so it works with the sun too and captures heat.,2
151192,I didn't really understand so I just made a guess. :(,1
151199,Because it os hitting the greenhoue wihich is armosphere,2
151186,The sun makes the green house work,2
150915,Because the sun plays the role of the glass.,2
151193,it is atmosphere because it can use all the planet.,2
150916,In the picture it show a glass garden and a heat transfer.,2
151205,it is the atmosphere because it looks like the lines are representing the glass.,2
151206,The greenhouse has a glass and the earth has atmosphere so that the sun can go through each of them.,3
151203,why i picked the sun its because the radiation would transfer the heat and then it would let it out.,4
151214,it's earth because it all types of tempetures,2
151212,The glass of the greenhouse is like the atmosphere of earth because it shows the energy from the sun trying to escape earths atmosphere.
