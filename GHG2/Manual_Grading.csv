136465,the atmostsphere is because it is absorbing the light and traping it in it is not letting any light out,4
150101,i chose earth because the sun rays are deflecting the earth,3
154218,well the sun attracts glass because it will make it shine more and it will attract the sun and solar radiation,3
118622,,1
118628,the atmosphere is the glass because it is the thing that absorbs the heat and the solar radiation,3
151209,i dot no,1
136546,the atmosphere is like glass on a greenhouse it keeps in some sunlight or heat and uses it to our advantage,4
139795,the atmosphere is like the glass of the greenhouse because the sun can pass through the atmosphere and the atmosphere helps the earth to absorb less energy,3
153864,the glass on the green house is what the sun rays are going through in the earth picture the atmosphere i what is the sun rays are going through so it is happening to both also the line around the earth is the atmosphere so that is also why,4
118458,the sun is bouncing off of the windows of the green house like the sun is bouncing off of the atmosephere,2
154117,i chose atmosphere because the atmosphere is surrounding us and it is also out around the earth so in the picture it is like the glass that the heat energy is coming through if it was space then the heat energy might escape the sun is circling around the earth but is not in one place like a big circle surrounding us and it can t be the earth because that is what is inside of the thing surrounding the greenhouse and the heat energy,3
136424,the atmosphere is like it because it let light in but reflects some,4
154201,the earth is the only planet in space that has radiation from the sun,3
151225,i don t now,1
136492,i think this because the atmosphere is trapping the heat so it will heat up the place or thing it is hitting,3
150163,the atmosphere is like a greenhouse because it grabs suns heat and light,3
136569,the atmosphere is like the glass trapping some heat inside it,3
149950,the earth is the glass because the heat waves bounced off,2
136549,the atmosphere is like the glass of the green house because when sr goes threw the roof it hits the plants and ur light comes back just like the earths atmosphere and sr goes threw it and hits the earth and comes back as ur light i know this because on the wise project in i think when we molded the green house gasses to guess are hypotenuse we learned that green house gasses go threw objects and bounce back,4
153924,because it keep all of the air in side,2
118612,the sun is reflexting the sun like the green house,2
118559,,1
118551,,1
154325,the atmosphere is like glass it lets sunlight enter and will let little of it out so that way the earth is not cold and a block of ice,5
136557,the imaginative line is the atmosphere because the atmosphere is like the glass the earth is like the plants the sun is the generator and space is just where heat travels,2
136388,the atmosphere lets some sun in like the glass and keeps it there because it reflects off the earth back to the atmosphere and back to earth,3
136421,the atmosphere does not let the heat out,3
139812,it passes through the glass and keeps the heat inside,3
136420,the atmosphere is whats bouncing the light and heat back to the earth,3
150097,the earth because earth traps heat,3
150061,i chose earth because the earth takes in the heat just like the green house windows,2
136475,the sun glass of the greenhouse will reflect all of the greenhouse,2
136418,earth has life on it but we are like a green house because when the sun hits on us it makes plants grow and how earth is a green house is because a green house it meant to help plants grow and on earth we are always a green house because the sun always hits on us and makes the plants grow,2
118486,i chose that because its like the greenhouse it goes in it and it can t escape,2
136460,the atmosphere surrounds the earth kind of like the glass in the greenhouse also the arrows are bouncing off the earth like they did to the plants and then they can t escape through the atmosphere,2
154325,atmosphere determines how much heat should be inside the earth it keeps tempatures ideal for life on earth and lets heat leave earth too but it could only be little heat,2
136405,i think it s the atmosphere because it s just like the glass of the green house well i think this because it lets in the sun s eat just like the house once it gets inside it d traped,4
118463,because the atmosphere traps the suns heat so the earth could stay warm,2
153908,the atmosphere because the atmosphere is bouncing of some of the rays of heat and light,3
136504,i think it is the atmosphere is the glass because the glass makes all the energy s reflect the sun from the glass that is why i think that the atmosphere is the glass,3
118407,the glass lets the light in but does not let the heat escape that is like what the atmosphere does,4
139534,the atmosphere is like the glass of the greenhouse because this is where the sun light goes in but never goes out it traps the heat from the sun,5
154336,becues it green,2
118371,i think it is sun because the sun reflects light,2
154129,the atmosphere is like the glass because it reflects off the sun so a little will come through,2
118405,the earth is like the panels because the earth atmisphere is not letting the sun escape,2
154371,it is because the atmosphere show how the heat goes in and doe not get out,4
154316,it is like the glass because it is not letting the heat escape,3
154142,my answer is that atmosphere is like the glass in the greenhouse because the atmosphere covers the earth and the glass covers the greenhouse,2
154132,because the sun gives us warmth and energy,3
136567,the atmosphere because it keeps the heat energy but no direct heat,3
154128,the atmosphere lets the sun rays pass but is doesn t let them get out,5
150123,the glass keeps heat in and bounces it around the atmosphere does the same but to the earth,3
136380,the atmosphere is like the glass of a greenhouse house because it is keeping the heat inside the earth like the glass keeps the heat inside the greenhouse it is also like a little covering over the earth just like the glass,3
118454,the air is so polluted that it keeps the warm air in and the cold air out,2
136397,the sun because it shows how heat comes through the atmosphere ad the glass but bounce off it and never gets out,4
118299,if you think about a little that lines moving toward the greenhouse could be solar radiation because basiclly solar radiation is the sun so thats what i think,3
154205,the earth is absorbing some of the heat sunlight but not all like the greenhouse,3
139507,the glass is like the atmosphere because while it lets the light rays pass through it also reflects some of the heat light rays back out,4
153981,like the glass the atmosphere is allowing the sun rays to turn into heat warming the earth in the greenhouse s case the glass is what is allowing the sun rays to pass through without the heat bouncing off and turning into infrared radiation,5
118571,i think it is space because it will act like the green house,2
150133,i chose the atmosphere because the sun is shining light down on earth through the atmosphere,3
139836,greenhouse gases absorb this energy thereby allowing less heat to escape back to space and trapping it in the lower atmosphere many greenhouse gases occur naturally in the atmosphere such as carbon dioxide methane water vapor and more,4
154142,the atmosphere is the the glass in the greenhouse because it keeps the heat on earth,3
150915,the answers beside earth are not similar looking to a greenhouse,2
150243,the earth is like a glass of a greenhouse because it traps hot air and sometimes deflects it,3
139477,the light goes through the atmosphere onto the earth but it does not go through back out into space and is trapping the light and heat around the globe,5
154141,the atmosphere is like the glass of the earth because it traps the heat from the sun going into the earth so the energy from the sun can t com out,4
139819,the atmosphere is more like the glass because its keeping the heat inside,3
118337,,1
118454,the heat is getting trapped in the air and heating earth,3
154214,the glass is like the sun in the in the picture because the suns rays hit the glass and the glass projects sunlight to the plants,3
139525,the atmosphere has greenhouse gasses like co which trap air in,2
118510,the atmosphere doesn t let heat out into space like how the glass doesn t let heat out of the greenhouse,3
139494,the part of the picture that is like the glass of the greenhouse is the atmosphere because the atmosphere traps different gases thus having carbon dioxide and harmful gases trapped in our ozone layer and causing global warming,2
118624,,1
136369,when the solar radiation reflects off of the earth one of the earths atmospheres will keep it trapped on the earth instead of letting it go into space,4
136499,i think the glass from the greenhouse would be the atmosphere i say this because the sun shines through the atmosphere and the atmosphere keeps in the good heat and throughs out the bad,3
118546,the atmosphere stops the heat energy from escaping just like the glass in the greenhouse,3
154215,because it comes and bounces back bcause one it bumps into something it bounces back,2
118323,on picture a it shows you how the glas keeps the heat in well it works the same way with the earth,3
149970,the atmosphere lets some heat in and some out like the grass,3
118347,it appears to be the same because the sun heat will go inside but when it tries to escape it will instead bounce around but cannot escape,2
154122,cause of all he energy that enters,3
118442,because it lets light into the earth,3
136405,i think the atmosphere is like the greenhouse glass because when the sun comes down and hits the earth the atmosphere traps the heat and stops from too much of radiation coming in,4
150195,the atmosphere is like the glass because it lets heat through but it doesn t let it out same with the glass,4
154139,the atmosphere is like a thick blanket and helps keep warm air get trap,3
150178,the sunlight goes to earth and the sunlight goes through the window,3
118401,the atmosphere is just like the glass panels in the green house because it keeps heat inside the earth just like the greenhouse,3
118391,it looks like earth s atmosphere is trapping the heat energy from the sun and letting the solar energy escape,2
153980,because the sun s rays are hitting it then bouncing off,3
150167,the atmosphere is like a glass wall it secures the earth making sure only light comes in but its very fragile,4
118346,because the sun is in the space so the space cannot be the glass of the greenhouse the atmosphere is close to the earth so it could be the glass,2
139494,the part of the picture that is like the glass of the greenhouse is the atmosphere because the atmosphere traps different gases thus having carbon dioxide and harmful gases trapped in our ozone layer and causing global warming,2
153925,the sun bounces of the earth,2
139533,the atmosphere traps the greenhouse gases on the earth and heats up earth,2
136574,i think it is the atmosphere because it is above earth and because i heard that one of the atmosphere s layers is really hot because it traps the energy,4
118557,the earth and the glass act similar because they both reflect heat and they both absorb heat,2
154316,its like the glass because it holds in enough heat and lets some out,2
139787,the atmosphere is like the glass of a green house cause it reflects heat and traps it in as well,3
139529,it s the one that keep the heat that the sun,3
118474,it will get hot,2
118440,sun because the green color is light and it reflects off of the house and that is what the arrow is the heat is going in then coming out,2
139499,the atmosphere has the ability to trap warm gases causing the earth to heat up greenhouse gasses causes the atmosphere thicker making it hard light to pass through,2
154214,because the atmosphere reflects heat all around earth and provides plants energy and animals and people heat,2
150145,the atmosphere is keeping the heat from getting out to space,3
118632,,1
118529,i think that is the atmosphere because it is like a layer that can reflect the sunlight to shine on earth,3
118350,the atmosphere lets in the sunlight but then when the sunlight hits the earth the earth obsorbs some of i s energy since the earth absorbed some of the sunlight s energy it didn t have enough energy to push it s way back out of the atmosphere so it just go back down to earth and heats the earth just like a green house,3
118472,,1
136410,because it is a layer that surrounds the earth traps heat and does not let it escape,3
139829,it is the border where the light can either be absorbed or reflected depending on the heat waves and radiation,3
118524,the glass of the greenhouse is most like the earth because the surface of earth is reflecting and absorbing the heat as the glass of the greenhouse is,2
150053,it keeps the heat in,3
150221,the atmosphere protects earth and keeps all of the heat inside of earth,3
136368,when it hits off the greenhouse glass it was reflected when i saw that the earth reflected sunlight it looked like the greenhouse glass,3
153905,the atmosphere lets radiation in but makes it more difficult for the heat radiation to escape it acts as a sort of blanket just like the atmosphere,5
136404,it looks like the earth is like the glass because i see the light getting reflected of earth and bouncing back into space,3
150205,i said the sun because the sun is giving sunlight to the plants,3
153999,the atmosphere is like the glass in the greenhouse both make it so the heat does not escape to heat up the earth,3
154217,the sun is reflecting the sun beam of light will go throw the glass and the plants will grow in side and not in side,4
150195,because in the picture it shows that heat is trying to escape but it only some makes it out and this like the greenhouse because greenhouses trap the warm air in,3
118293,the atmoshere is like the glass because the light can get in the atmosphere but can t get out,4
153916,the atmosphere lets sunlight in and traps the heat inside making the earth warmer,5
139496,from picture b the dotted line which is the atmosphere is preventing heat energy from escaping into space,4
118535,earth absorbs heat so that we can stay warm and the green house s roof also absorbs heat so that the plants can grow since they both absorb heat they both are alike,2
150164,the atmosphere increased the power of the sun rays,3
154326,the atmosphere is the glass panels for the earth,2
141559,well the atmosphere keeps in the heat like the glass it keeps it in but rarely lets any in,3
118447,the atmosphere because the greenhouse effect is what keeps the sun s heat inside to warm the earth,2
118526,it would be the earth because the earth gathers the heat just like the green house,2
136462,the atmosphere absorbs some of the suns radiaon rays some of the rays leave the atmosphere to go into space the energy that traps in the atmosphere are being used,5
136571,the atmospher is like a window also reflecting most of the light but light is still cominig in helping the plants and things grow,4
139834,it acts like an insulator and keeps the heat inside the earth,3
139785,just like the atmosphere the glass traps in the solar radiation that comes from the sun which makes the room hotter,4
150078,the atmosphere reflects the sun rays like the glass does,3
150178,i choose this answer because the sunlight goes through the windows or glass,3
118305,the sun would light the green house,2
118632,its the atmosphere because its sucking sunlight inside the earth,3
154111,i think the atmosphere is like the green house glass because the atmosphere takes in the heat but wont let it out like the green house,4
153837,the atmosphere is like the roof of a greenhouse because for both photos heat cells are bouncing off the atmosphere and greenhouse roof,2
118371,space is like the glass of the green house because the sunlight goes to space,3
136498,the atmosphere is like the glass of the greenhouse because it closes and keeps all the heat that comes toward to make the temperature increase,3
136570,the heat from the sun enters the atmosphere and the atmosphere prevents the heat from escaping,2
136381,i chose earth because in picture a it shows the waves from the sun goes into the greenhouse and that is what the sun is doing in picture b,2
136391,i chose this awnser because in the picture of the earth it has the light bouncing off the glass acting as earth,2
118589,the heat from the sun passes through the atmosphere as if the het from the sun going to the greenhouse would be passing through the glass panels which lets heat in and keeps heat in,2
118513,earth because it keeps the heat like the greenhouse,3
154115,it s like the atmosphere because the glass traps the heat from the sun in and the atmosphere doesn t let the heat from the sun leave the earth,3
118563,the heat has to pass the glass to heat the plants and earth is like that also the heat passes through the atmosphere and then heats the earth,2
139798,the atmosphere is earth s armor the glass is the greenhouse s armor,2
118391,the glass on the green house allows solar radiation to enter and release infrared radiation and capture the heat energy,3
153816,atmosphere contains air and keeps in being warmed by sun,3
118440,the atmosphere because the heat comes from there,2
136464,the reason is that the atmosphere covers the earth and keeps us safe you could say and the green house is like the atmosphere for plants it provides what it needs and that is my reasoning,2
136514,i chose the atmosphere because like picture a where it is showing a real greenhouse where light form the sun passes through the glass panels and heats the inside just like in picture b the atmosphere is another way of looking at the glass because all the sun is coming inside the atmosphere and from the earth it is reflecting out just like the glass and the greenhouse with glass panels,4
154317,its like the one in space because its shooting out beam of light back,2
118524,the atmosphere acts as the glass of the greenhouse because they both keep the warmth in,3
136356,i think that the atmosphere is like the glass in the greenhouse because the greenhouse glass absorbs the solar radiation and traps it in because the glass reflects the solar radiation just like the atmosphere the sun gives solar radiation to the earth but once it enters the atmosphere it s trapped because it reflects the solar radiation like the greenhouse glass,4
136558,i picked that because the suns rays are going right through,3
118487,the atmosphere is trapping the heat to,3
154143,green is the land or mountain that has been created to get radiation and also it is convection,3
118545,i would choose earth because the glass acts similar gecause both reflect heat and they absorb heat,2
136364,the suns rays come down to earth and hit the atmosphere and it changes when it hits the earths surface,3
154134,the atmosphere because the atmosphere in and outside of the earth protects it and allows a certain amount of sunlight and radiation caused by the sun into the earth,4
136481,the atmosphere is like the greenhouse glass because the sun rays pass through the atmosphere like the sun rays do when it passes through the glass of a greenhouse and it gets trapped and bounces off the earth s surface and back the the atmosphere and continues the cycle,5
154127,i chose atmosphere because it is the part of the universe that lets some energy into earth and reflects the rest of it,3
139515,the atmosphere acts like the glass of the greenhouse because it regulates the amount of light that enters the planet the atmosphere reflects most of the sun s harmful radiation back into space while keeping the infrared radiation similar to how the glass panel does in the greenhouse,4
154308,the atmosphere is going to trap all the air as the ozone layer is there for that reason nowadays since there are gases such as carbon dioxide,2
139495,the atmosphere reflects and also takes in the light energy the same as the earth s atmosphere is doing in the diagrams,4
151217,a shows a real green house where light,2
139505,the glass of the greenhouse traps heat in the house after it has passed into the house through radiation similarly the atmosphere traps heat from escaping the earth after it has reached the earth s surface,5
118352,the reason the atmosphere is like the glass is because the atmosphere like the glass reflects some light and absorbs some light,3
136390,i think that the atmosphere is like the glass of the greenhouse because it is acting like a reflector and reflecting the sunlight the greenhouse glass is acting like a shield reflecting the light and heat same as the atmosphere,3
139787,the atmosphere is like the glass because it absorbs the light and bounces it back,3
136559,if you look at the glass and the earths atmosphere they both have a little sunlight going through,4
139806,both the glass and the atmosphere keep the heat energy from escaping,4
139488,the atmosphere that surrounds the earth and keeps the hot air inside is like the glass of the greenhouse that keeps the hot air inside,3
118448,the atmosphere because it acts like an insulator to keep heat in,3
118526,i know this because the sun light is hitting the earth,3
153835,i think that the glass is most like the atmosphere because the heat goes through the glass and then is tapped in whle on arth the heat hits the land then rises into the air,3
150242,the atmosphere shows a line that looks like a cover the sun is sending light in and out of earth,3
154221,the sun comes through the atmosphere and then hits earth then comes back to the atmosphere,2
118471,the glass and the atmosphere keep heat inside but they don t keep all of the infrared radiation,4
118624,i chose this answer because in picture b the sun s light is going on the earth s surface and the atmosphere is reflecting back the light the sun is giving,3
150109,the atmosphere is like the glass in the greenhouse because the atmosphere warms up the earth like how the glass warms up the heat rise,2
136509,the plants will asorb the sunlight and the plants have water insied of them to,3
136557,earth is the planet which is the one who bounces the heat the sun is million miles away from earth and is the one radiating heat space is the place where the heat travels through,3
118313,the atmosphere absorbs sunlight and traps it on the surface of the earth which is very much alike the greenhouse,4
118358,because heat can not escape the earth,2
151208,i think the atmosphere because the sun s energy reflects off the atmosphere into the earth s core,3
136522,the atmosphere is most like the glass of the greenhouse directing the solar radiation toward earth and reflecting some of it,3
154107,the sun because it is called a solar panel which attracts heat from the sun and goes inside of the building which heats up what ever is in there,2
153835,i think the atmosphere is most like the glass panels because the heat will hit the earth then bounce into the atmosphere and back onto earth like how the heat travels through the panels then bounces back off the panels but still stays in the greenhouse,3
136468,i think the glass of the greenhouse is like the atmosphere because it keeps our air in and it keeps the suns reflections from killing us and the suns reflection shines in the greenhouse and the glass keeps the heat in just like the atmosphere,4
153983,the sun because the sun will come through the top and help the plants grow,2
139543,this is because the atmosphere acts as a mirror because it has molecules that trap sunlight in,4
118549,i think this because the atmosphere is like the green house glass because the glass traps the sunlight just like the atmosphere dose with the sunlight the atmosphere traps the sunlight then the plants absorb it,4
139880,the atmosphere is like the glass of the greenhouse because it keep the heat energy from escaping same as the glass in the greenhouse,4
150126,the heat can t escape through the atmosphere,3
141559,well earth can take heat and let some out so it can be kinda like a green house but will like millions of people,2
118634,,1
150124,the atmosphere is a layer that traps all the heat from leaving earth,3
118555,the sun because that is were the light comes from,3
139545,the atmosphere is like the glass because it allows radiation to come in and traps some heat and lets out the infrared radiation,5
136379,because it take in solar radiation and some is reflected,3
139492,the atmosphere contains carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gasses that trap heat within the atmosphere,3
150173,the atmosphere is like the glass in the greenhouse because the sunlight goes through the atmosphere like in the greenhouse then it bounces of the earth,4
153989,i think this because the atmosphere keeps people on the grow so heat would stay on the grow,2
118360,the atmosphere is letting cold air out and keeping heat and light in,3
118603,cause it looks like the light is coming in side,2
150116,the atmosphere is like the earth s glass it does not let the sun light escape,4
154147,the atmosphere works like the window because the energy can get through it and heat up the inside and it also reflects off the surface,4
136425,it is like the sun because it is getting trapped in the greenhouse and making it hotter when the molecules get trapped it gets hotter because they are moving around everywhere,2
154026,the atmosphere acts like the glass because it lets heat in but doesn t let it out,4
136494,i chose the atmosphere because the atmosphere is basically the roof of earth letting earth get heat from the sun,2
