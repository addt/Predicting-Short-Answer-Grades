150201,i think the atmosphere is the glass for the greenhouse because the atmosphere is a glass for us,2
118294,,1
153921,i think the atmosphere because it is letting heat into to earth just like the glass is letting heat into the greenhouse,2
118587,i think it is the atmosphere because it acts like the glass from the green house,2
118454,the air is so polluted that it keeps the warm air in and the cold air out,2
118293,the atmoshere is like the glass because the light can get in the atmosphere but can t get out,4
139537,atmosphere has greenhouse gases which reflects and change the directions of the infrared radiation which it often reflects it back to the surface of the earth,4
150215,it is like the plastik rap,3
154155,atmosphere acts as the glass because it acts as the barrier were all the radiation goes in,4
118592,the atmosphere because the house is letting the heat from the sun go in and that is like the atmosphere which also lets the suns heat go in earths atmosphere,2
139855,the atmosphere is like the glass of the greenhouse because it lets the sunlight in but traps heat so it the inside of the greenhouse will get hotter,5
139768,the glass is like the atmosphere sine it can contain the heat inside for the moment,3
136522,the atmosphere is most like the glass of the greenhouse directing the solar radiation toward earth and reflecting some of it,3
139486,since the atmosphere is what reflects sunlight back into space it is mostly similar to the glass panels on the greenhouse that reflects the sunlight,3
136380,you can see in the picture that the troposphere is like the glass on the greenhouse it keeps the heat in that the sun producing that is what keeps earth warm on there really warm days all day the troposphere keeps the heat in close to earth,3
150109,the atmosphere is like the glass in the greenhouse because the atmosphere warms up the earth like how the glass warms up the heat rise,2
136509,the plants will asorb the sunlight and the plants have water insied of them to,3
136502,i think so because once heat comes in it can t get out,3
150174,it looks like it because it is very light,2
154311,the sun light bounces off and gose to space,3
136492,i think this because the atmosphere is trapping the heat so it will heat up the place or thing it is hitting,3
154309,i think it s the atmosphere because the atmosphere let s heat in and prevents heat from leaving that s what happening in global warming the atmosphere is trapping to much heat and the globe is slowing warming up that s what we want our solar oven to do but not our world,4
153818,the sun produces the energy so it isn t the glass space doesn t matter the question is about the earth the earth is like the box it is the thing heating up,3
150205,i said the sun because the sun is giving sunlight to the plants,3
150056,the sun is like the greenhouse because they both let the heat come in,3
118418,i think it is the atmosphere because the atmosphere is like a shell that lets things come in but does not let gases come in but does not let gases out,2
136583,the glass is like the atmosphere because it traps some of the heat from the sun,3
118628,the atmosphere is the glass because it is the thing that absorbs the heat and the solar radiation,3
139514,the atmosphere contains greenhouse gasses that trap the sun s energy,4
139830,the sun goes through the atmosphere just like the sun goes through the window of the greenhouse in picture a and becomes trapped inside,3
118570,,1
153905,the atmosphere lets radiation in but makes it more difficult for the heat radiation to escape it acts as a sort of blanket just like the atmosphere,5
154704,the atmosphere lets the sun rays in but the sun rays that bounce off the earth reflect off the atmosphere and heat up the earth,4
118470,in the green house there is glass that keeps the heat trapped in and in the picture b the atmosphere seems to be doing the same thing,3
139795,the atmosphere is like the glass of the greenhouse because the sun can pass through the atmosphere and the atmosphere helps the earth to absorb less energy,3
139538,the glass of the greenhouse absorbs the heat inside but reflects some of the heat back like the atmosphere of the earth the heat from the sun passes through the atmosphere and some of it will either reflect back in or reflect back out,2
150156,because injfd,1
136457,the glass of a green house can let sunlight and solar radiation through but it may be a bit difficult to let the heat and access light escape that may be the same with earth s atmosphere it lets in solar radiation and light through but once the light is reflected off the earth s surface i guess the atmosphere keeps it in or it may be heat instead,5
149956,the sun reflects from the glass keeping it warm if you did not have the sun reflecting it would not get any heat,2
154214,because the atmosphere reflects heat all around earth and provides plants energy and animals and people heat,2
150905,the glass in the greenhouse is like the atmosphere because they both let heat into something and they both can bounce heat off of it,3
151216,the sun is going through the windows and the sun is going to the plants transfering energy to the plants,3
154156,the atmosphere traps the sun heats and the greenhouse is cover of sun heat,3
136494,i chose the atmosphere because it holds the heat from the sun that goes off the earth and into the atmosphere,2
136379,because it take in solar radiation and some is reflected,3
154119,i think it is atmosphere because it is surrounding the earth the sunlight is hitting the atmosphere,3
154218,well the sun attracts glass because it will make it shine more and it will attract the sun and solar radiation,3
136461,the earth looks like most of the light is being reflected because the earth is made of bright colors so most of the light is reflected just like glass,3
150070,because it is the layer that keeps the heat in like the glass in the greenhouse and both have something that the heat goes on to,3
136566,it looks the same because the sr can not escape in the greenhouse glass and the sr can not escape the atmosphere,4
139829,it is the border where the light can either be absorbed or reflected depending on the heat waves and radiation,3
153977,the atmosphere is like the glass because it lets the rays from the sun in but does not let them get out,5
136378,the heat of the sun comes in past the atmosphere touches the earth come back up and then it will get reflected by the atmosphere,2
118416,i think this because the atmosphere keeps the heat in like the glass,3
118626,i think the atmosphere is like the glass because it lets the heat in but not out,3
139515,the glass acts like the atmosphere because it lets solar radiation in while reflecting some infrared radiation back towards the surface,5
136352,the atmosphere keeps i a lot of heat and light if it gets through to the earth like the greenhouse less light and heat will escape,4
150235,light passes through the atmosphere like the glass then keeps it from leaving like the glass does,4
118345,this is like the glass because it lets some through and reflect some,2
150228,because it keeps it from it,2
150167,the atmosphere is like a glass wall it secures the earth making sure only light comes in but its very fragile,4
136572,the atmosphere is trapping the heat and reflecting the sun to the earth,3
154313,because the atmosphere lets out extra heat but carbon dioxide keeps in the heat so it doesn t escape,3
150149,the sun is going through the glass and getting into the warm greenhouse to give the plants light,4
154312,the heat goes through but it wont come out,4
154152,i picked the sun because i think it brings a lot of radiation,3
139864,the atmosphere allows solar radiation to go through and also keeps the heat inside the earth,5
118306,the glass makes the green house hot and the sun keeps the earth hot,2
118544,its like the glass because the heat just goes right through the atmosphere,2
149972,the atmosphere is what keeps the heat in like the glass on a greenhouse,3
136459,it s the closes thing to the radiation point,2
136363,the atmosphere would try and keep the heat from escaping,3
139806,both the glass and the atmosphere keep the heat energy from escaping,4
139556,the atmosphere is like the glass of the greenhouse because it takes heat in but doesn t let it escape,3
151188,the earth is like the windows in a greenhouse because it is letting heat inside the earth but some heat is also bouncing off,3
136483,i think this because the glass of the green house does the same job the atmosphere,2
139847,the greenhouse keeps heat in and so does our atmosphere so they both have the same effect,3
136424,the atmosphere is like it because it let light in but reflects some,4
139816,like the glass of the house the atmosphere lets light pass through and trap the heat within its shield,3
150242,the atmosphere shows a line that looks like a cover the sun is sending light in and out of earth,3
139514,the atmosphere is transparent allowing light to go through the atmosphere acts as a glass that traps the light energy from the sun when the earth is reflecting the light thus the earth becomes warmer,5
136378,the atmosphere is holding the heat in like the green house is holding the heat in,3
154141,it can t be the sun because that s what is projecting it wouldn t be the space because that s whats around it and the earth is what the sun is at,2
139491,the glass for the green house help keeping heat in and warm the green house similar to the atmosphere where that layer would keep heat it and prevent it from escaping into space,3
154147,the atmospher heats up like the green hous because shield is working like the solar pannels,2
150085,i believe this because in picture b the sunlight heat was stop at the dotted line,3
136355,the glass of the greenhouse is like the atmosphere because because they both can reflect and absorb heat,2
150066,i think space is the right answer because in space they have solar panels are heat transfer stuff out there and it looks like the the greenhouse glass in the picture,2
118634,,1
136483,i said space is the answer because the space is reflecting the energy source to go back to the earth and heat it up,2
136404,the earth seems to be reflecting the sun but i don t know why,2
118542,the sun because the sunlight in the picture almost has the same radiation as the greenhouse gasses,3
136496,parts of the atmosphere concentrate rays so that the ground gets the most light just like the glass,3
136559,if you look at the glass and the earths atmosphere they both have a little sunlight going through,4
139879,the atmosphere is where the sun s rays will bounce back just like in the greenhouse,3
118529,i think that is the atmosphere because it is like a layer that can reflect the sunlight to shine on earth,3
136569,when the solar radiation passes through the glass of the greenhouse it becomes infrared radiation it is very similar to what the atmosphere might do,4
118535,earth absorbs heat so that we can stay warm and the green house s roof also absorbs heat so that the plants can grow since they both absorb heat they both are alike,2
118314,,1
118528,it reflects heat back in just like glass,2
136403,the part of the picture that is like the glass of the greenhouse is the atmosphere because the suns energy is coming through the greenhouse glass just like the suns heat comes through the atmosphere and heats up the earth on picture b,3
139808,the glass in the green house help the heat stay inside and so does the our atmosphere it keeps the sun heat inside to keep us warm here on earth,3
139864,the atmosphere either traps or reflect the energy given off by the sun,4
118533,because the long chain molecules like carbon dioxide and methanes reflect the ultra violet light back at earth which traps the heat in our atmosphere,2
118530,because the sun goes into the panels and th sun gives sun light to the plants,3
118521,the atmosphere acts like a reflector,2
136400,the glass blocks heat from going out of the green house and the atmosphere does that to,3
139493,the atmosphere is what makes the heat stay inside causing the average temperature of the earth to stay at a constant temperature at the same time though because of all the greenhouse gases it is causing global warming as well,3
154136,i think that the atmosphere is like the green house because the atmosphere does not let the heat esxape from the atmosphere,3
118581,its like the glass because heat from sun is getting absorbed,2
139832,the atmosphere because they both let light through but trap in things like infrared radiation,5
154026,the atmosphere acts like the glass because it lets heat in but doesn t let it out,4
136407,both keep in the heat,3
150164,the atmosphere is keeping the energy from escaping,3
118551,,1
118527,i am not really sure,1
118463,because the atmosphere traps the suns heat so the earth could stay warm,2
150076,i think earth is like the glass from the greenhouse because the both of them reflect the radiation,3
150126,the heat can t escape through the atmosphere,3
154210,it is he atmosphere because the atmosphere collects heat and traps it inside,3
118529,i think it is the earth because the earth will obsobe some of the heat but then it will reflect some of the heat this turns into infered radiation,3
118315,the atmosphere is like a green house but instead of using glass the atmosphere has green house gasses which absorbs heat and keeps heat in which is what we call globle warming,4
154846,the atmosphere is most like the glass of the green house because it is letting light into the earth like glass in the greenhouse,3
153925,the sun bounces of the earth,2
154132,because the atmosphere traps heat to keep our earth warm and it also protects us from meteors as it breaks them down,3
118456,i picked atmosphere because just like the greenhouse glass the heat goes through the atmosphere,2
139536,the atmosphere is the glass because it is the layer which has light coming in but also has gases that earth or the plants release trapped in,5
151226,the sun is giving the energy to the plants in the green house,3
154342,i think atmosphere because it kind of like a protection dome that stays over earth and it is like a window in a way it is like a window because it could be meteor coming towards earth and the atmosphere will protect it on a rainy day your windows will keep rain out of your house,2
136453,the atmosphere is acting like the glass because it is conducting the sunlight and preventing it from leaving,4
118415,the atmosphere is like the glass of a greenhouse because they both let the solar radiation through to the ground to turn into heat,4
139836,greenhouse gases absorb this energy thereby allowing less heat to escape back to space and trapping it in the lower atmosphere many greenhouse gases occur naturally in the atmosphere such as carbon dioxide methane water vapor and more,4
136461,the light is absorbed making the earth hotter and it acts just the same as the greenhouse gasses,3
139513,the atmosphere traps and reflects infrared radiation back towards earth s surface,4
136495,the atmosphere is like the glass because it absorbs uv light and it hovers over and all around earth just like the glass,3
118450,i think the atmosphere because just like the heat shines through the glass matches when the heat goes through the earth s atmosphere,2
139845,atmosphere is like the glass of the greenhouse because the ray of light cross this part,4
153916,the atmosphere lets sunlight in and traps the heat inside making the earth warmer,5
118446,the glass is like the atmosphere because it lets in sunlight which provides heat,4
153919,its is the atmosphere because it shows in the picture that the glass in the greenhouse is letting radiation in and letting little radiation out just like the atmosphere in picture b,5
150085,the glass of the greenhouse keeps in heat it is also on top of the building the atmosphere also keeps in the heat and is on top of the crust of earth,3
153923,i think that the atmosphere works like the glass because it keeps the earth warm and it keeps it warm,2
136356,i think that the atmosphere is like the glass in the greenhouse because the greenhouse glass absorbs the solar radiation and traps it in because the glass reflects the solar radiation just like the atmosphere the sun gives solar radiation to the earth but once it enters the atmosphere it s trapped because it reflects the solar radiation like the greenhouse glass,4
118488,,1
136360,because its shining on it,2
136364,the suns rays come down to earth and hit the atmosphere and it changes when it hits the earths surface,3
154324,the sunlight comes through the glass which then gets the sunlight to the plants,3
139528,they both allow energy in and seem to prevent it from escaping,5
149955,i chose because the atmosphere will let heat go in some it will just stay behind,3
154115,the atmosphere because it traps in all the air heat waves we get from the sun,3
139541,sunlight passes through the atmosphere and heats the earth and it keeps the heat energy from escaping just like the glass panels,5
118407,the glass lets the light in but does not let the heat escape that is like what the atmosphere does,4
136422,i think it is the sun because sun passes through the glass panels and heats the inside of the greenhouse,3
139856,light passes through the atmosphere and heats the earth except heat can leave earth too much affects earth negatively,4
139501,the atmosphere is like the glass of the greenhouse because it is the point where the sun rays start the enter,4
118524,the glass of the greenhouse is most like the earth because the surface of earth is reflecting and absorbing the heat as the glass of the greenhouse is,2
136457,well the atmosphere is kinda the only thing that floats invisibly above space excluding space at least also don t or of the layers in the atmosphere have a lot of heat of at least catches a lot,2
136361,the atmosphere is like the glass of a green house because the heat can come in but it is hard to get out it also heats things up,3
139865,the atmosphere acts like glass because it holds some of the heat inside,3
151210,nose,1
118603,cause it looks like the light is coming in side,2
153839,the atmosphere is like the glass of a greenhouse because it s what is surrounding the earth just like glass of a greenhouse surrounds a greenhouse,2
150907,the atmosphere has a green house effect on the earth because the sunlight is coming through the a like the glass on a green house and the green house glass is letting some sun out while the rest is staying in,4
118475,the sunlight is absorbed by the ground and trapped underground,3
153832,the atmosphere is leting in only some light ad only leting out some light to it works just like a solar oven,5
154156,the atmosphere traps the energy,4
153918,it looks like the sunlight is shining of earth,3
154208,the atmosphere seems to keep the different types of radiation in and create heat,5
118602,,1
139523,the atmosphere is like the glass because that is where all the green house gases are which reflect back the heat like the what the glass is doing inside the greenhouse,2
154026,it is like the greenhouse glass because the heat is going in and it is not escaping,4
118545,the sun because it makes the light green and it gets reflected and makes the glass hot,2
136454,the atmosphere is like the green house glasses because it helps heat come in but doesn t let it come out,3
149970,the atmosphere lets some heat in and some out like the grass,3
149961,it bounces the sun light off it,3
118299,well the sun is mostly going to be heating glass because it reflects to light so its most common for the sun to hit glass,2
136420,the atmosphere is whats bouncing the light and heat back to the earth,3
150204,the atmosphere lets the light in but does not let the heat out so it warms the earth just like the glass to the greenhouse,5
139526,earths atmosphere is like the glass of the greenhouse because the sun rays penetrate through and when they reflect back into the atmosphere some of the heat is trapped in the atmosphere,5
149956,the sun is keeping heat for the green house which gets energy,2
139487,the atmosphere allows sun light to pass through and heating the earth the atmosphere can also prevent heat energy from escaping into space,5
149968,because the,1
153933,i think it is the suns reflection and the greenhouse keeps the sun in and creates evaporation,3
118442,because it lets light into the earth,3
153928,the atmosphere because it absorbs he sun s heat an it also keeps it inside like he greenhouse,3
153989,i think this because the atmosphere keeps people on the grow so heat would stay on the grow,2
139839,the glass is like the atmosphere because that is where the energy is being either bounced off or absorbed,3
150917,the atmosphere at a clear force field around the earth to keep in the air it also helps keep in the heat from the sun,3
150199,i choose the atmoshphere because if there was no atmosphere then the light would come right threw earth but the atmosphere protects earth,3
150922,the atmosphere is magnifying the light from the sun,3
118583,in a green house solar radiation gets sucked in then it is not allowed to leave,4
118487,the atmosphere is trapping the heat to,3
118618,i said the atmosphere is like the glass because lets different gasses in,2
154148,because the atmosphere takes some radiation and kicks the others out,4
136522,the atmosphere is like the glass of the greenhouse because it can absorb light,3
139800,the atmosphere is like the glass of the greenhouse because they are insulators the atmosphere traps infrared radiation so it doesnt escape into space and the glass does the same except it traps heat inside the greenhouse,4
139518,the atmosphere is where the sun s rays pass through to reach the earth s surface the atmosphere is like the glass of the greenhouse in that it will trap the heat energy from escaping,5
136456,the atmosphere is thick enough to trap the heat on earth which basically keeps us alive,3
118416,,1
139481,like the glass of the greenhouse the atmosphere is not letting heat energy from the sun escape but is coming back down to the earth s surface,4
118316,the sun shines the light in too the earth,3
139778,the glass is the atmosphere because it allows sunlight to travel in but also trapping it inside the earth greenhouse,5
118586,,1
150244,the sun goes through the glass and keeps bounceing back and fourth and hitting the plant,2
118293,the atmosphere acts like the glass because it lets the sun light go in but the sunlight can t get out,4
136468,i think the glass of the greenhouse is like the atmosphere because it keeps our air in and it keeps the suns reflections from killing us and the suns reflection shines in the greenhouse and the glass keeps the heat in just like the atmosphere,4
