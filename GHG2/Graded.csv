139869,i chose atmosphere because it just floats around,2
118619,the atmosphere surrounds the earth like the glass around the green house,2
139801,i say atmosphere because the atmosphere absorbs greenhouse gases and the sun s rays must go through the atmosphere,3
151207,i think its that because the atmospere has a line and the heat was bouncing of the atmospere,2
118515,i think it is the atmosphere because the atmosphere is around the earth by space,2
153922,the atmosphere is like the glass on the green house,2
150106,the sun is hot but when the glass in the sun are together it heats up hotter,2
151229,the sun is shining on the plant inside,2
118466,in the picture the sun goes through the glass the sun also goes through the atmosphere,2
118611,nan,1
118571,i think it is space because it will act like the green house,2
118594,because the atmosphere is in the clouds and if you pass the clouds your in space,2
153917,i think this because earth can reflect the sun back to it,2
136553,because in the real one it shows the blue arrows pointing to the glass and in b the earth has blue lines pointing to the dotted line,2
136477,the atmosphere because the atmosphere is reflecting to,2
136469,i picked that answer because the sun is shinning down and earth is refecting it and the atmoshere is containing it,3
153979,because the sun will reflect on the sun and heat the greenhouse,2
150153,the atmosphere keeps most of the heat from escaping earth,3
154121,the sun will reflect of the glass,2
150079,because the earth can safe heat from the sun and gives the earth heat and warmth,2
118562,the sun is shining on it,2
151190,the sun is facing the windows you can even see the sun,2
139803,nan,1
139879,nan,1
151174,i think it is the sun becaues there are arrows going through the green house,2
154210,the atmosphere absorbs the heat and reflects it the absorbed heat warms earth up,3
150219,i chose that the atmosphere is similar to the glass of a greenhouse because it collects heat but keeps it from escaping,3
118348,the sun because it is hot,2
118540,i think it s the atmosphere because it s like a blanket covering just like the glass,2
153863,because it is in between of both of each other,2
136418,earth has life on it but we are like a green house because when the sun hits on us it makes plants grow and how earth is a green house is because a green house it meant to help plants grow and on earth we are always a green house because the sun always hits on us and makes the plants grow,2
118548,i think the sun is like the glass in the greenhouse because the sun can reflect of the glass in the greenhouse and it can reflect on the earth,2
139810,nan,1
150086,i cant explain it,1
150166,because ht sun is shiny and its a hot thing and it helps things heat up,2
151199,the sun because it has reflected the glass in to a layer which has created,2
139483,the atmosphere acts like a greenhouse because it traps some of the heat in which warms up the earth,3
139803,nan,1
139797,nan,1
150053,i choose atmosphere because the green house glass acts like a shield to the green house and the atmosphere dose the same thing but for the earth,2
153860,the atmosphere is what is surrounding the earth and if the sun is directed towards earth it will go through the atmosphere causing it to heat up,2
136413,the sun is in both pictures and it also makes a big effect on the objects and things in both pictures,2
153997,the atmosphere because its like the roof of the world that helps it not get to hot,2
149947,the atmosphere shelters earth,2
150063,i knew it couldn t be sun space or earth so i put atmosphere,2
118526,it would be the earth because the earth gathers the heat just like the green house,2
118511,i think this answer because the way the heat is bouncing of the earth looks like the glass from the greenhouse,2
150055,the sun because it is the same thing as a hot place and heat,2
118415,the atmosphere is what surrounds the greenhouse earth which means it is like the glass of a greenhouse,2
118314,yes the windows,2
150136,it seems as though the sun is beating down onto the earth and reflecting back into the atmosphere displayed in the digital drawing,2
118473,because it shows in the picture the it show the atmisphere,2
150916,in the picture it show a glass garden and a heat transfer,2
118318,nan,1
118343,the atmosphere is like the glass of the greenhouse because the sun can reflect in and out the sun can pass through the atmosphere,2
149951,in picture b it shows how the heat bounces of and in picture a it shows the same thing,2
118509,it is like a ring around the earth,2
151220,the earth s gravity pulls the heat in and keeps it there like the greenhouse,2
154341,it is the sun because the sun is gloowing on the plants,2
136397,i think the atmosphere because it kinda of acts like the glass on the green house,2
153982,i got my answer from the passage at the top and that gave me the idea to select sun as my answer,2
136480,because the sun hit the greenhouse and reflected back somewhere else into space probably,2
150144,the atmosphere would trap the heat to warm the earth,3
118303,the atmosphere because the atmosphere looks like but it works like the glass to,2
118610,the sun s heat goes to earth then hit the earth but before that could happen it goes through the atmosphere,2
153987,i pick that because if you see in the picture it shows dot line,2
151182,the atmosphere is like a glass from the zen garden,2
151176,it is between the sun and the plants,2
153916,the glass traps the heat inside like the atmosphere traps in the carbon dioxide,3
154120,in picture a shows the sun hitting the glass of the green house and in picture b the earth is being hit by the sun,2
150155,because it is not letting the convection escape,2
118354,the sun reflects to the green house,2
151192,i didn t really understand so i just made a guess,1
136377,i choose the earth because the sun reflects on the earth and makes the earth heat up,2
150093,i think the atmosphere because that is the outer layer and it is the layer the protects it,2
154310,its the sun because the sun gives the eat and the sun is going to absorve,2
151181,i chose sun because it directly facing the grass,2
118523,well becuse earth is getting heated up also,2
118400,the earth is like the glass in the picture because it reflects,2
118525,it is earth because it shows it on the picture,2
139561,because the atmosphere contains molecules and greenhouses gases that either absorb or reflect the heat back,3
149965,in picture b the sun is transfering the heat to earth picture a the glass is observing the heat from the sun,2
151219,the sun will make it grow faster,2
150090,because the glass is a wall the lets the sun in but the atmosphere is also basicly aglass roof,3
151228,i think is they put the green grass the grass could be brown,2
136354,i chose that because it looked like it would be the glass and also it reflected some of the sun so it dosen t get to hot,2
136452,it is bouncing off,2
136351,the sun is like the glass because they both create heat,2
118598,the atmosphere is like the glass because it s letting heat in but isn t letting it out,3
118349,the outide of earth represents class in a green house,2
118522,the atmosphere because it makes it bounce back,2
150915,because the sun plays the role of the glass,2
118485,the atmosphere because it works like a bubble,2
154215,i think the atmosphere because it will help the plant stay alive more,2
150145,the atmosphere is keeping the heat from getting out to space,3
136417,the sun because it will heat up,2
118452,because it is reflecting off the earth and it is kind of absorbing it too,2
151202,because right beside the picture it shows the earth,2
118606,its the part that the sun passes through,2
150090,because the atmosphere keeps the air in so we can breathe and a greene house glass keeps the hot air in so the plants can grow,3
139802,nan,1
151227,i think its space because it has all sorts of stuff,2
153831,atmosphere because it reflects the heat back to earth,2
139643,the atmosphere has greenhouse gases that trap heat within the atmosphere like how glass traps heat inside the greenhouse,3
153835,i think that the glass is most like the atmosphere because the heat goes through the glass and then is tapped in whle on arth the heat hits the land then rises into the air,3
151174,the sun is like the glass because it is going to earth and bouncing off,2
154224,i chouse this buacause that is what it s like in the real,2
136402,that is where the sun is coming in through the glass,2
118316,it shows the sun because it shows the sun shining in different places,2
118479,the sun because it affects the green house in many different ways,2
150207,earth is like the glass on the greenhouse because it is the part absorbing the sun,2
136518,nan,1
151162,it looks green so does the earth,2
150160,i chose the atmosphere because space would just let the heat get out and we would all die because of the coldness,2
150157,because it is the same coler as the glass,2
118308,because you need water for a green house and earth has lots of lakes and oceans,2
150239,atmosphere because it shows itself blocking the sun a little from the earth,2
118309,because i see a picture of earth on the other side,2
136366,it s the atmostsphere shows it being the class because it picture b its shows the sun reflecting off of the atmostphere so the glass is that,2
150214,the earth is the glass because it going right into the earth,2
154143,its the peace of land that exists on earth,2
118419,the sun is going to the greenhouse,2
139828,the atmosphere is like the glass because like the glass the atmosphere both absorbs and reflects the heat,2
154353,the sun brings heat,2
118402,because at picture b it shows the greenhouse effecting earth,2
136413,the atmosphere reflects heat around the earth and goes all around the glass is like an atmosphere,2
118437,glass just lets the sun go through so does the atmosphere,2
150094,the heat bounces off the earth,2
151196,its sun because you can see the sun shine down on the green house,2
136414,it is like space because it is outside of everything else,2
154334,the green house is earth becouse we have lots of plants,2
118516,i think that it is atmosphere because it is like glass you can not go through it by your self,2
150169,it is like glass,2
150065,there is no solid line which means the line in picture b is probably gasses,2
154318,i think the sun because in order for the plants to grow you,2
150202,it is like the outer layer,2
118478,green house gas collects up in the atmosphere and creates the glodel warming,2
151231,it reflects that so it can give sun to plants for food,2
150194,because the atmosphere traps heat on the earth,3
150175,i chose the sun because for picture a it was the the glass that was heating the green house up and the sun heats up the earth,2
154133,why i said that the glass from the green house looks like the earth because the sun s heat goes in the earth but does come out,4
136351,i chose earth because when the sun hits key points in the earth the sun beam will reflect back to the atmosphere,2
150061,i chose the atmosphere because the atmosphere traps in heat like the glass,3
150900,because earth is round,2
150221,the atmosphere is like the glass in the green house because like the glass it is keeping the heat inside earth to warm earth up,3
153919,i think it is atmosphere because in picture b it shows the sun going into earth and bouncing back and the atmosphere containing it,2
118566,the atmosphere of the green house is the outside of it,2
118604,the atmosphere is like an invisable wall,2
136508,i chose atmosphere because in picture b there is a circle shape around the earth that s why ichose atmosphere,2
118577,the atmoshere works like the glass on a greenhouse,2
150112,the atmosphere is like a glass shield but you can go through it so it akts like glass,2
118480,it is like the atmosphere because its becoming really hot when the sun reflects on it and then it gets through to the earth,2
118553,because their both green so they are like sister and brothers,1
150249,the lithosphere were we live is like the inside of the greenhouse and the atmosphere is the glass,2
118578,picture b is like the green house because it is similar to the suns raise bouncing off the earth,3
150168,i chose atmosphere because in the picture the the circle around the earth in the seven layers of earth s atmosphere,2
136373,it looks like the sun is coming from the glass on top of the house thing,2
118474,hclbjmdbkgvmtihbkvjtyue oorhygtfjmiuk,1
118438,both earth and the greenhouse absorb heat and then release the heat after a while,2
118310,i think the atmosphere because the is make the sun not escape the earth,3
154153,the sun hits the green house,2
136354,it is like the glass because it reflects some and lets some in like the glass doses,3
150246,its space because its like nothing just something floating,2
118591,it looks the same because the sun goes into the greenhouse just like its going into the atmosphere,2
118553,it s the sun because that makes the flowers healther and makes them survive more,2
118411,the glass is in between the sun and crops and the atmosphere is in between the sun and earth,2
139851,nan,1
150237,because both heat look the same way coming in,2
154208,the atmosphere traps in heat and circulates it,3
150245,the atmosphere is like the glass of the greenhouse because it is a layer of air that sort of covers the earth and protect it from getting to much heat,2
150236,the atmosphere because it attracts the sun,2
149954,the atmosphere is like the glass witch makes thing worm,2
150915,the answers beside earth are not similar looking to a greenhouse,2
151186,the sun makes the green house work,2
154340,it show sun glowing at the plants,2
154198,the heat was reflecting off the atmosphere back inside,2
136408,in the picture the earth is reflecting the heat,3
