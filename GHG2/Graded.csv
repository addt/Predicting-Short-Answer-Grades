139533,the atmosphere serves as a covering of the earth as does the glass does for the shed,2
154000,because the heat gets in but can t get out,4
139768,nan,1
150236,the atmosphere because it attracts the sun,2
136416,it reflects most of the heat but not all of the heat,2
150065,there is no colored thing there which probably implies that the line is probably air,2
119017,in the the greenhouse sun goes through the glass in the earth picture the sun is going through the atmosphere,2
150057,i didn t choose earth because that would be like the plants since its the lowest object,2
154216,the atmosphere because the atmosphere provides the air,2
150172,because heat goes into the glass from the sun so basically the sun is the glass,2
153856,because space surrounds us aka earth,2
154134,it is the atmosphere because it is the atmosphere in and around the earth that impacts the temperature on our planet based on how close or far away our planet is from the sun,2
118464,it is like the atmosphere because it blocks the sun,2
136555,the atmosphere keeps heat in just like the glass keeps heat in,2
154306,as the atmosphere does the oven traps the heat inside to heat whatever is in there,3
139851,nan,1
139802,nan,1
151193,i dont know,1
118397,i think earth because in picture b it shows earth on the inside of the oval shown in picture b,2
154114,its atmosphere because the atmosphere would reflect the sun into the earth and heat it up,2
136360,sun because the sun is like the heat going into the oven and the earth is the oven taking in some heat and refecting some heat,2
150082,i think that the earth is like the glass because it shows the arrows going into the earth,2
154157,i think glass because if its really hot outside it can be worm inside unless if you have a cooler inside the room it will make the heat go away,2
118562,the sun is shining on it,2
118419,the sun as you could see that the sun is coming straight to the green house and the earth,2
118308,the sun because it will provide heat in a greenhouse,2
118553,it s the sun because that makes the flowers healther and makes them survive more,2
150177,it is because space is on the outside of the earth,2
150123,the atmosphere because the atmosphere is like a blanket that traps all the heat so it won t get out,3
151190,the atmosphere is the same as the outside becasue both are clear,2
118410,it is on the green on the earth,2
154162,the atmosphere reflects the sun so it wouldn t get that hot,2
118308,because you need water for a green house and earth has lots of lakes and oceans,2
150097,i chose sun because the sun goes right through the panels,2
153918,well in picture a the roof glass and the sun hits the plants which bounces off and in picture b the sun hits earth and bounces off and hits the atmosphere like the roof in picture b,2
153823,atmosphere because it is like the earths roof,2
118417,i think why is beacuse the heat from the green house will take engery from the plants,2
151191,the atmosphere is like a glass,2
151218,i don t know,1
118473,because the sun is heating the plants,2
154197,the atmosphere is like the glass because the heat from the sun is going through it,2
150138,the glass is traping the suns heat,3
154346,i luck the pichar and luck a sun,2
118353,the atmosphere because it will shin out ans in,2
136500,i chose the sun because it is moving very crookedly like the red lines in the green house,2
154159,the atmosphere is like the glass,2
150902,because the picture shows that the earth is with the sun,2
150203,it is not allowing the heat to go out,3
118411,the atmosphere is earth s blanket so the lines bounce off the atmosphere,2
149954,the atmosphere is like the glass witch makes thing worm,2
153930,the sun reflects into the little shed,2
153917,i think this because the sun shines in and stays in there,4
153936,sun because you need sun,2
118603,because the heat will be reflting of,2
118588,because it does the same job as the green house gases,3
149960,atmosphere because in the it bounces out of the green house,2
154204,it is the same because the sun just goes off the atmosphere like the glass,2
153927,sun because the plants need to grow if we want to eat,2
6971,it shows that the atmosphere is covering the earth so the sun can not reflected that mush in to the earth,2
118543,the atmosphere looks like it has glass,2
150239,the atmosphere is like the glass from the greenhouse because its deflecting some of the cold air,2
153837,i think so because in picture b it looks like a big roof around the earth,2
118552,the sun hits the atmosphere,2
139861,they are both keeping the heat inside from escaping,3
150167,glass is a barrier whilst the atmosphere is earths border,2
118634,nan,1
136508,i chose atmosphere because in picture b there is a circle shape around the earth that s why ichose atmosphere,2
150220,it is the atmosphere because the atmosphere is what protects earth from heat like the sun,2
150158,the sun is helping the plant and people to see,2
118418,the atmosphere is like glass except stronger because in the picture it shows atmosphere acting the same,2
118319,because the atmosphere serves as a window for earth it is the same thing but bigger,3
136450,the atmosphere will reflect most of the heat back onto earth the glass will reflect the heat back into the house,2
154133,why i said that the glass from the green house looks like the earth because the sun s heat goes in the earth but does come out,4
154323,becuse the heat has to make it through,3
136563,the ozone layer keeps the heat in,2
118469,the earth is green,2
139795,nan,1
153927,because the sun will bounce off the glass and go in,2
150090,because the glass is a wall the lets the sun in but the atmosphere is also basicly aglass roof,3
139801,i say atmosphere because the atmopshere absorbs greenhouse gasses and the suns rays must get through the atmopshere,3
118396,the sun because it make one of the live and grow,2
139806,because both of the atmosphere and the glass of the greenhouse trap the heat from escaping,3
154125,so the heat gose in,2
118345,earth is like grass because it is the next lowest thing,2
118519,the sun because in picture b it shows the sun is shinning hard at the earth,2
150073,the atmosphere is like the glass because it limits how much sun is coming to earth,2
154211,the heat can go into he atmosphere but can t leave that is the same with the green house it can go through the glass but can t leave,4
118453,the glass is the like the atmospher on the earth because the glass is the roof and the atmosthphere is a roof to the earth,2
118318,nan,1
154141,it can t be the sun because that s what is projecting it wouldn t be the space because that s whats around it and the earth is what the sun is at,2
154135,it is like the geenhouse because the atmophere is reflecting the heat back at the earth aka the green house,2
150915,because the sun plays the role of the glass,2
118567,the atmosphere is like the glass because the heat can go in but not out,2
151216,because the atmosphere is what is making the sun inpact on the glass,2
151204,i chose this because the sun hit the green house,2
136497,because it is above the earth a little and it shows heat from the sun going in and not coming out,2
150114,the sun mack it growe,2
118609,nan,1
150082,the earth is like a reflector reflecting of the sun,2
154218,well the sun helps the plants that are in the greenhouse grow and form,2
150910,because the glass makes the sun to be attracted to the house,2
153854,the heat from the sun is warming up the house like solar,2
150157,because it is the same coler as the glass,2
136452,it is bouncing off,2
136399,thw sun will hit the crops making them grow,2
139506,this reflects some sunlight and traps heat particles in,3
118582,because it show on the pic that the sun reflect like the glass of the green house,2
136411,because it is the most hot and brings in heat,2
136520,nan,1
118300,because they look simalair,2
118579,the atmosphere because it is like the glass letting the gas out,2
154307,i think it is the sun because the glass looks like the sun is going in it,2
118320,this was my answer because the top of the green house would be the glass and that is where the sun would be shining,2
136456,the atmosphere is thick enough to trap the heat on earth which basically keeps us alive,3
154202,the atmosphere s gases trap heat the same way a greenhouse s glass works to trap heat,3
151207,i think its that because the atmospere has a line and the heat was bouncing of the atmospere,2
150208,the atmosphere is like the glass because it acts like the protection around the earth which is the greenhouse,2
118577,the atmoshere works like the glass on a greenhouse,2
136513,because in this situation i think the greenhouse is so post to represent the earth by showing about the atmosphere,2
154310,its the sun because the sun gives the eat and the sun is going to absorve,2
149962,the sun because it reflects off of the green house,2
154340,it show sun glowing at the plants,2
150059,it is because it is mostly like that in the way the it goes up and then down,2
151196,the sun goez through glass,2
150090,because the atmosphere keeps the air in so we can breathe and a greene house glass keeps the hot air in so the plants can grow,3
139797,nan,1
118337,nan,1
118509,it is like a ring around the earth,2
118372,the atmosphere is like the glass beacouse it ceeps the inside hot,2
139843,nan,1
149965,in picture b the sun is transfering the heat to earth picture a the glass is observing the heat from the sun,2
154200,the sun hit both the earth and the greenhouse,2
154341,it is the sun because the sun is gloowing on the plants,2
118480,it is like the atmosphere because its becoming really hot when the sun reflects on it and then it gets through to the earth,2
153838,i chose the atmosphere because the sun is reflicting off the glass,2
136553,because the earth is adsorbing all the heat,2
150230,the atmosphere is the sphere that is all the air wich is why the heat is staying inside the atmosphere,2
151198,it is the outer layer of earth,2
136565,nan,1
118455,the atmosphere acts like glass to create humidity,2
118438,both earth and the greenhouse absorb heat and then release the heat after a while,2
150101,i chose atmosphere because the small purple arrows are inside the atmosphere and going back into earth into the greenhouse,2
150249,the lithosphere were we live is like the inside of the greenhouse and the atmosphere is the glass,2
150069,the sun is the roof because the sun heats up the green house so that the plants can grow,2
151210,nose,1
118569,the atmosphere because it is like a glass to cover the sun away,2
136485,nan,1
139803,nan,1
118348,the sun because it is shining in the green house,2
150205,i pick the sun because it looks like the greenhouse is getting heat from the sun even the picture b,2
136351,the sun is like the glass because they both create heat,2
118392,well the atmosphere works like the glass from the green house from part a and that is how the heat does not scape from earth,3
150200,it is the sun because it is collecting it,2
118487,in the picture the sun is not going through the atmosphere and the sun is not going through the glass of the green house,2
154212,i think this is like the glass is the green house because the sun is bouncing of the earth and that also happens with the glass in the green house,2
150129,the atmosphere is acting like the glass because the sun is shining on the glass so the atmosphere would be like the glass in the bigger picture,2
118354,the sun reflects to the green house,2
150052,i think earth because this is where all the trees grow and where life is,2
118398,earth because it is on earth so i think that it would be earth,2
118413,atmosphere because the glass of a green house keeps the heat inside of the greenhouse and the atmosphere keeps heat inside of the earths atmosphere,3
154327,the atmosphere because since it is thick the hot air has trouble going out of it,2
153913,because the atmosphere reflects to the heat to bounced off of it to give heat,2
136400,the atmosphere reflects the heat back down to earth,2
151180,i chose this answer because i want to,1
118547,because the sun hit the glass,2
150249,the iside of the greenhouse is the lithosphere and the atmosphere is the the glass,2
