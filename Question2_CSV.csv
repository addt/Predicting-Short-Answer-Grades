118296,"His car should be warmer than outside because it has been out there doing nothing so it had given the car a chance to get really hot.

Katie ;)",2
118300,If all the windows are up then its going to be really warm.,2
118302,"It will be the the same temperature in the car because in the discription it says in caps ""COLD"". It also says Akbar hasn't used his car in a week, so that means that he hasn't put on the air conditioning or the heater. So that would make his car the same temperature as outside.",2
118310,"I think it would be warmer than inside because, the sun is hitting the car directly so the heat is going 
to make inside the car hot.",2
118304,It is in the sun so the sun heats up the car and the heat is trapped in the car.,3
118313,"If it is in the sun, the heat goes directly towards it and keeps it warm.",2
118319,because the temperature can change because it might have been hot one day but it says it was cold so the temperature changed to the cold,2
118297,Cars get cold if they are not used everyday and if someone didn't use there car for a week the car will be cold.,2
118298,I think it is warmer than outside because it was sitting in the sun not being drivin for a week.,2
118311,the air in the car is the same because the air has been trapped in the car for a week and it is in the sun the sun hits through the window and then air gets hit with the sun when you get in it is going to be the same like outside but if you are driving and you roll down the window fast air would come in then the car will be cool.,2
118305,it is warmer because it is parked in the sun and the car must of gotten warm by the sunlight ,2
118293,Well the car holds the cold air and more cold air keeps getting pushed in so the car will eventually get colder than the air outside.,2
118299,"Well it depends because,some cars only use cold air some hot and some have no air conditioning and some have both but all in all it just depends what kind car you have. ",2
118309,because if its a cold day then it will be realy cold,2
118307,Because the doors are closed and the cold air can not get inside.,2
118306,well my hipothisis is that the car is warmer than the outside air because it might have absorbed some of the hot air outside ,2
118308,Because it could be cold outside and you have the warm air conditioning on in your car which makes your car warmer than outside,2
118321,It must be warmer than air outside because of the fuel in the car and the things inside the car.,2
118312,I think it is warmer than the outside air because on some days we leave our car parked in the sun and than we go in the car and its warmer than the outside air.,2
118318,"the answer is that if it is iron it heats up really fast and it is very hot.
when it heats up and you touch it it is burning why ...... because it is iron
and the sun heats up the iron when it is very hot.",2
118303,I think that it's warmer than the outside air because the cold outside made the outside of the car cold and the in side must have warm air trapped inside of the car.  ,2
118314,i predictit is the second one becousen it not to cold or too hot ,2
118301,"The car will be warmer than the outside air because,its been sitting in the sun for a long time.Also if there is some cool breeze outside when its very hot the car can't get the cool air because the car is closed.And if the sun is directly hitting it the car will definitly be hotter than than the outside. ",2
118316,i think it will be warmer than the out side air because the sun has been shining into the car.,2
118320,I said this because there is usually a certain temperature outside everyday.If you want a warm temperature in your car even when it is hot outside you could possibly have your car warmer.,2
118294,His car might have the greenhouse effect so his car might be hotter inside or hotter outside or the same temperature.,3
118315,a car is built like a oven and because there is metal on the outside it will heat up fast and the contents in the inside heat up slowly then that makes the car almost like a oven :),3
118323,"I belive the car will be colder than the air outside because, the car was outside so that means all the cold air was hitting the. the car is metal so it makes the car even colder.",2
118482,I think that the car is warmer than the outside because when I get in my car when its cold its more hot inside my car.,2
118478,When it is hot outside in is sweltering in the car,2
118479,Its the same because the hot or cold air gets in the car by the engine and it can make the car warm or hot depending if it is hot or cold.,2
118480,"It might be the same temperature as the outside air because the car hasnt been driven for a week, and its been outside for a while.",2
118473,its cold ount side and when drive a car u have to wait until its warm so its probely the car will be cold maybe there is wind out side maybe the window might be open,2
118474,"becuase there are opinings in the car so the car stays the same temperture as the outside
",2
118483,This is because the Sun shined through the glass which made the car very hot,2
118470,"Usually in the morning when i go into my dad's car that is parked outside, it is colder than the outside temperature.  That is if it is cold outside.  If it is super hot outside usually it is hotter in the car than the outside temperature.  So i thought of that observation and answered the question, the car would be colder than the outside air.  It is a COLD day.",2
118472,I think it's the same temperature as outside because the car is in the sun but at the same time the weather is cold.,2
118468,"The outside would be colder because in the car, the heat is confined so it would stay warmer longer but outside the air would release a lot of the heat it had before",3
118475,The car contains heat more and if it was in the sun it would warm up.,2
118477,I think it would be the same air as the air outside because first of all if its cold outside your car will become cold so you have to turn on your car and wait for like 5 minutes for it can warm up so its basically like a human.,2
118465,"The car is closed off from the outside world, so the air would naturally be warmer in the car, although not too much warmer.",2
118487,I think the car is warmer than the outside air because when this happens to my car is always hotter that the outside air,2
118488,well usually when its hot outside the air in the car gets a littler warmer because the car is smaller in than the outside world and there are at least 1 to 5 people in a car depending on how big your car is.,2
118486,I picked that because the sun was shining on it so it must hotter than outside and its was under the sun for a week. Also it was colder outside than inside of the car.,2
118484,"It depends on the weather. In the morning the car will be cold because, it was out all night.If you did not have to go any where untill 4:00 the car will be hot if it is a hot day If not then it will be cold...That i how i know it is neather.",2
118485,"Well I think that it is warmer than the outside air because,it has been there for a week and its sunny outside and the heat from the sun shines into the windows and the car gets hotter.",2
118490,i think that it is warmer than the outside air because if its parked in the sun itll be warm inside than outside because all the heat is facing the car and the cold air is all outside ,2
118467,It is the same as the outside air because where ever the car is the air can go threw the car if the window is open ,2
118471,The sun is heating up the air inside the car but there is no cold air to cool down the hot air so it only gets hotter.,2
118469,the car hasn't been driven or even had people in it for a week so the car must be cold,2
118466,I think it is the same tempature because the warm or cold air can get in by small holes and cracks in the car.,2
118543,it will be warmer than the outside air because since the cold molecules and the warm molecules will combine and since there would be more warm air transforming in it would get warmer.,2
118515,i think it is warmer inside the car than the outside of the car because whenever my parents park in the sun in like 2 hours later it is extremely hot in the car.,2
118517,"If it hasn't been driven for a week than it would be burning hot in the inside I know this because it happened to our car before and it was super hot.
",2
118533,It will be hotter in the car because the car is insulated by the fabric and foam.,2
118518,"I think that it will be colder than the outside air because when it's hot outside your car is generally hotter than the air around you so, I think that it will be colder in your car than the air around you.",2
118548,I think it is exactly the same because its cold outside which makes it cold inside the car. like in the morning when its cold the sun could be hitting the car but the outside air makes the car no be hot.,2
118522,because the condistion makes all the windows colder which means that the inside is colder :),2
118562,well it depends on if its hot or cold.So if its hot the inside of the car will be hoter than the outside. So scence it is traped so imagen how hot it will be in the car.But if it was cold the car would feel like it is colder than the outside of the car but its really not.,2
118526,"i picked this answer because if its cold outside,but its parked in the sun then it would be hotter in the car then outside of the car.",2
118567,this is because it is made out of metal and metal can be really cold on the inside if it is cold outside.,2
118516,"The car is warmer than the air outside because if the car is in the sun then it will heat up the inside maybe because the seats are leather which makes it hot,also i have been in car so in my car the steering wheel gets hot and also the buckle gets hot.  ",2
118521,It will be warmer then the outside air because when the heat goes on to the windshield and the windows the warm air gets trapped inside the car.,3
118520,Because if the seats are leather it makes it hot.,2
118514,"If Akbar's car had been barked in the sun the car would absorb the heat, and the heat would stay contained in the car, because it does not have a passage out of the car.",3
118512,A car on a cold day is usually warmer than outside because the car is airtight so the cold air can't get in the car which is room temperature. ,2
118509,It was in the sun and was really hot but now its a cold day so the car cooled down.,2
118534,because you have air conditioning on in the car so once you come outside air.,2
118519,it is really hot out side and it is hotter then out side and you can't stand it.,2
118511,I think this answer because well if it cold outside and the car is parked in the sun then it would be the same tempater,2
118542,I think that it will be colder because if the air is trapped in the car then the inside of the car will have to even the coldness to outside.,2
118537,I think that it would be that the temperature of the air inside the car would be colder than the air outside because there is absolutely no heat in the car.,2
118529,It is warm because of the heat that was shined on the sun. IF it was longer in the sun it would have been more warmer.,2
118536,The energy was stored from the weather when Akbar closed his door.,2
118523,well when its hot inside of the car is super hot so when its cold im guessing the car is cold to,2
118530,I think it will be warmer in the car because if he didn't use it sincen one week and now its cold so in the car it's warm,2
118510,It captures the heat from the outside in when he closes the door. The heat from the outside will beat on the metal of the car and heat it up.,2
118513,i thinks its warmer because it hasnt been used for a week so its has warm air inside,2
118556,I think it is warmer than outside because the car might have been sitting outside in the sun for a long time.,2
118549,i think that the temp will be hot in side the car because it was parked right below the sun so the heat coming from the sun will effect the temp in the car,2
118607,the coldness from outside makes the car cool and the cold gets trapped in the car making it cooler,2
118622,I predict it would be warmer because it is parked in the sun and has not been on. So the inside would be warmer.,2
118604,a car is made of metal an plastic making it hotter or colder based on the out side taempreture,2
118614,"if you open the car door to get into the car you are letting the outside air into the car so therefore,the air is exactly the say.",2
118628,The car is the exact same temperature as it is outside because the sun sends heat waves to the car and the car get the heat wave and heats up.,3
118632,I think it will be the same temperature inside  like it is outside,2
118602,i think it will be warmer in the car then it is outside because the car has been sitting outside in the sun for a week and all the air has been traped inside of the car and when all that air has been traped in the car and the car has been sitting outside all of the air in the car starts to heat up,2
118600,In side a car when the sun beats down on the metal and heats the inside of the car.,2
118623,It is most likely going to be hotter that the air outside  because all of the air is trapped inside a small space and the sun is beating down on car and the car is metal.,3
118613,the sun has been pooring down on the car all week so it will be very hot,2
118610,probably warmer because the car has been out in the sun for a week without the AC.,2
118618,"If the car has not been driven in a week and has been siting in the sun,it is going to be hot. Also, the windows reflect light into the car making it even more hot.",3
118626, I think that because the sun is only hitting the outside not the inside and it is cold outside so that means that it is same inside.,2
118621,because some of the outside air goes inside the car through the window ,2
118611,the temperature is going to warm because it been in the sun for a week and the warm air inside was warm so it is make  it more warm so it is warm.,1
118606,"if it was in the sun and not used for a week and now its cold out its probably a little warmer than outside
",2
118620,it may be cold but its still hot from the sun.,2
118616,I predicted that the inside of the motor hasn't been used and is outside in the hot weather. That will cause the car to get warmer and heat up .,2
118601,I think his car will be hotter than the air on the outside because the heat heats up all metal and other contents in the car.,2
118615,"because if you leave it for a very long time, it will get even hot",2
118624,"I chose this answer because if the day is cold,nothing changes, the car still is parked in the sun and maybe the sun has been up for the whole week, so the sun's heat is focused on the car.",2
118634,the car is going to be hot because he left it in the sun and when u leave something in the sun for a long period of time it will stay hot in case he left it in the sun for a week so it will be hot.,2
118609,Since the car has air and it is hot outside the air inside the car heats up so that is how the air is warmer.,3
118612,the person in the car can turn the AC on cold,2
118947,If the windows are tightly closed then it should be warmer because the sun would heat up the outer shell and it will heat up the inside.,2
118344,The car will be hotter cause it absorbs the heat from the sun and makes the car hot ,2
118337,I chose my answer because on a normal temperature day the car would be warmer than the outside but the temperature outside was colder than a normal day so the car was heated up by the sun but cooled down by the temperature of the air outside. ,2
118358,"Because when it is hot outside it is hotter in the car so it must be the same thing
",2
118350,The car inside being warmer than the outside air makes sense because it being a cold day doesn't matter because if the car has been parked in the sun it will be warm because the heat gets to the car and since no one has opened or used the car in the past week then the cold air couldn't get into the car just the heat from the sun.,2
118353,i think that it is warmer than the outside air because if the car was not used for a week and it is parked in the sun it is going to be hot in the car.,2
118346,The car is under the sun so the air in the car is getting warm.,2
118366,It was left in the sun and has not been driven so most likely the car is warm,2
118352,The car may be exactly the same as the air outside because the engine may be shut down.The engine is a car's source of heat.,2
118355,The metal on the car warms the inside by radiating heat. witch keeps the car warm it also warms the leather since the sun shines through the window strait to the leather.,2
118338,"It's a cold day, but it is also a sunny day. The temperature of the air outside is what affects the the temperature in the car.",2
118348,I think it is warmer than the outside air because it takes in the warm air form the sun and does not let the warm air get out and does not let the cold air get in.,2
118349,I think it is the same as outside because usely when we our on a trip and we dont use are car for a while cause we use another on and its cold outside its usely the same temputer as the air outside,2
118354,"The weather out side is cold and he has left his car in the sun but,because he left his car in the sun does not in will warm because he has not used it for a week so it has to be cold inside.",2
118351,If its a cold day and the sun is shining it would be the morning so the car gets covered in fog so the car is cold on the inside.,2
118361,"The car is colder because the car does not get to hot that much as outside of the car
",2
118345,That is my answer because it has't bean opened so no colb air got in.,2
118341,The heat trapped inside the car rises to the top and can't escape while the cold air sinks to the bottom. ,2
118367,because he had his car parked on the curve he haven't been driven for a week now so the was warm because the sun heats the car up,2
118343,"I think it will be the same temperature as outside because if it's cold outside, it will be cold inside the car as well if it hasn't been driven for a week.",2
118357,it prodolly is hotter than the out side air because if you go in a car on a sunny day the car will be hot inside,2
118369,Its hot in the car because its been sitting in the sun and that effects the car.,2
118339,"I chose this because he parked his car a week ago, but it is parked in the sun and just because one day was a cold day does not mean every day was a cold day.",2
118372,"it would be colder  beacouse it has not been driven for a week ,but if it was a hot week before then then it would eather be the same as it is outside or warmer than outside.",2
118360,i dont know,1
118356,The sun is on the car to heat the car up but for a week it just get colder or hotter each day so this really depends.,2
118347,It will be hotter than the air outside because it has not been driven for a week a in side it will be hotter.,2
118371,"I think that the answer is going to be the air inside the air is warmer than outside because,it has been sitting in the sun for a week.  ",2
118368,the outside air is colder than inside air,2
118364,because i think the air would be trapped inside the car and get warmer ,2
118362,The sun has warmed the inside.,2
118397,I think that it will be warmer than the outside air because when I went in my dads car on a hot day all the hot air was in the car and it was really hot in there but not as hot outside.,2
118393, The car is warmer than outside because even though the car is off and the air is cold inside the car is still warm because the sun is hitting it so the car takes in the warmness of the sun and keeps it inside.So that is why I think inside the car is warmer than outside.,3
118417," I think this cause the heater inside the car makes u warm then the outside cause of the engine 
",2
118403,it is colder then outside because Akbar hasn't driven his car it in a week and during the nights it gets cold and all the air gets tapped in the car.,2
118410,it got hotter insid more than inside becas the hot air is traped insid the car. ,2
118392,well if the car is black in the inside and the sun is out the color black would absorb the heat and stay warm until the sun is goes down,2
118394,It will be warmer because the cold air cant come in and the sun makes it warmer in the small space.,2
118413,it is a little bit warmer because the sun is shining on it but yet again it is cold outside.,2
118408,it would be hoter the out side because the air is traped inside the car and it is is just heating up in the car,2
118409,it is going to be warmer because the sun was heating the car ,2
118401,The car obsorbed the suns energy so it would be hot even though its cold outside.,3
118405,it might be warmer because the car was parked in the sun for a week and the warm air in side the car couldn't get out so it stayed in side ,2
118402,It would be warmer because the sun has been hovering over the car for a week and the air would not effect the car because the sun is stronger then the air so it would be warmer ,2
118406,"Its warmer outside because, the air outside is cold  with the car being in the sun, IF the front window is being hit by the sun.",2
118400,l think the inside of he car is going to be warmer than it is outside because the car has not been driven for a week.,2
118415,I think the car would be warmer than the outside air because the car would preserve heat from the heat during the week from the sun.,2
118398,"I think it is waremer then outside air because i a car it is hotter then out side, some times it is cold but i think my answer is right.",2
118395,It will be colder than the air outside because the car has been sitting in the cold for a week and has not moved.,2
118412,the sun is warming the car up and the wind is only affecting the outside of the car,2
118391,The car hasn't been driven for a week so no heat has entered and on a cold day it can make the inside of a car very cold. I learned from experience. ,2
118411,The sun heats up the car even on a cold day.,2
118407,"When,I came from the pool, I found that the air was chilly. When I got into the car(it was park in the shade)it was very warm.",2
118414,The car is cooled down because the car has air conditioning.,2
118418,"I think the answer is: it is warmer outside because the sun is warm, and when it hits the glass, the glass makes the inside hot, like a solar oven.",2
118416,It would be warmer because a car gets really hot in the sun.,2
118396,it warmer because maybe  the window is close or the sun is shining on the car ,2
118419,The answer that i think it is because the sun warms than the outside air so hits the glass the heat makes the glass makes the food warm.,2
118404,i said colder then the outside air ,2
118439,"It is warmer because the heat from the sun penetrates and makes the car warm, another reason is cold air does not penetrate glass and the sun does. For example when you put a magnifying glass to wood and the sun is facing the wood it burns the wood because of the glass.",2
118437,I think the heat warms up the car. since the heat stays in the car there is nowhere for the heat to leave.,2
118438,"I think it will be warmer inside of the car than the temperature outside because in the car, it will just be normal room temperature and if its cold outside, it has to be warmer in the car",2
118443,"The car would be colder than the outside air because, the car hasn't been driven in a week and its cold outside the heat inside the car would have been turned into cold air because of the cold air outside.",2
118456,The air is warmer inside than outside because the air outside can't get in the car and the people breathe in the car and it causes heat.,2
118455,the car keeps the warm air inside but the air outside stays cold because the car has insulation.,2
118446,"I believe that the air in the car will be colder than the outside air because even though it was parked in the sun for weeks, the sun changes position so at night the car will be cold. If last night was cold and today is cold that's twice as much time the car has to spend being cold. Therefore the car air is colder than the air outside",2
118440,"It depends on the weather,if it is cold outside then it will be really cold inside the car because when it is cold outside the coldness will go inside the car and stay in there and it might also fog up the mirrors.If it is hot outside the heat will also heat the car on the outside making the heat go in the inside and heats it up and makes it warmer inside then it is outsiede.",2
118451,the car is in the sun so the car will warm up.,2
118462,it will be warmer because the sun was on the car for a week and the solar car trapped the suns energy and it is hearing the car naturally.,3
118442,"because if a car is parked in the sun, even if it is cold out, it will be warm in the car because of the fact that leather traps heat.",2
118447,"It would be warmer because the car is keeping the heat on the inside.
",2
118441,"If the car has not been driven for a week, it would be really cold, but it was parked in the sun. Also, its a cold day so the inside of the car is a lot colder then the outside.",2
118452,I think that the air inside the car is hotter than the air outside the car.,2
118461,If the inside of the car is a dark color than it will collect heat and the inside of the car will warm up.  If it is cold outside than the warm air in the car won't change because the car is insalated so the warm air stays in and the cold air stays out.,2
118460,I think warmer than outside because it was under the sun for a long time and been not driven that's why.,2
118464,it is warmer because the sun is hitting the car it is just a little bit warmer ,2
118453,If the car was in the sun a long time it would probably have warmer air inside the car than outside.,2
118458,The heat is still traped in the car but the oxegen died out.,2
118454,"It is colder than the outside air because it's been outside for a week so it's gathered all this cool air inside. So it's colder than the outside, because it has so much cold air.",2
118457,the hot air gets stuck in the car and that is how it get really hot,2
118445,"The car has been storing heat and exerting heat into the air of the car, where there are no points where the air can escape.",2
118450,I think the air inside the car would be warmer than the air outside because the car was parked in the sun it absorbed the heat and the cold air and mixed. Then the air was trapped inside the car not absorbing any air. ,3
118459,It is exactly the same because it not always hot and not always cold because it reflects the tempeture ourside.,2
118463,because the cold air is trap in side the car and the warm air is stopping from the cold air from escaping ,2
118448,Warmer because people are breathing in the car and the car is keeping the heat in.,2
118444,"the car has been sitting in the sun for a week, and since the outside of the car is metal, it acts like a thermos, and keeps the air inside the car hot.",2
118476,I think the same because its a cold day and the sun is not that warm for car to get warm.,2
118481,I say it is exactly the same because some people get home from work at maybe 7:30 PM or 8:00 PM after that they watch TV and go to bed. what i am trying to say is the car sits out in the cold all night.The car is sitting outside while cold air from outside is coming in the car through pipes and cracks. Once they wake up they do what they need to do before work then they get into their car and it is cold. ,2
118535,"i think it will be warmer than the outside air because the car was parked in the sun so, the heat of the sun will make the car warmer.",2
118540,"The air is cold because the air outside is cold even though the car is in the sun the air inside is still cold. With that said, the air inside is still cold even though the car is in the sun.",2
118544,it would be warmer than the outside air because the air is trapped inside the car and the heat through the glass warms the air in the car and since the air is trapped it cant escape and it just gets hotter and hottwe,3
118527,I think it is warmer then the outside air because the car was in the sun for a week without driving it.,2
118557,I think that it will be exactly the same as the outside air because even though it the sun is shinning it is also a cold day so the tempurature balences out with each other.,2
118528,"I bet cold air has been getting in all morning the sun might warm it up a tiny bit but not to the the point where it is as warm or warmer than the outside air
",2
118531,I think that the air in the car will be colder because the inside of the car is not completely sealed off from the outside air so some of the cold air will have seeped in and making the temperature of the inside of the car cold.   ,2
118524, I think the air in the car is warmer than the air outside because the car has been sitting in the sun.,2
118545,It makes sense that it is warmer inside the car because if you leave it in the hot sun it heats up the car  very warm. It is warmer than the outside air because the car was heated from the whole week,2
118558,It is warmer because the sun is really hot and his car was outside so it is warmer in Akbar's car.,2
118561,The day is cold and if the car is parked outside it means the inside of the car will colder.,2
118525,i think because it is out in the sun and the sun has warmed up the car for a week it is warmer than the outside air.,2
118539,the hot air gets trapped in the car or they have the heater on in the car,2
118554,"the car was in the sun, so the heat is greater",2
118566,The air in the car is warmer than the air outside because the car has been parked in the sun for a week and the car was closed so the air get warmer and warmer.,2
118565,"I think it would be warmer because the inside of the car would capture the air from the outside. However, I think it would depend on the air conditioning or if there was a heater in the car. Or if there was space to spread out, because normally warm molecules would spread out and unlike the cold molecules and the warm molecules they are the opposite of each other. With the warm molecules they would take all the room because they all would spread out. they are like that because those molecules are like us, when we are warm we spread out. When it is cold we would huddle together for warmth. For example, if you are on a cold day you would most likely stick with the person next to you. When you are hot you will ask for space, and a cold place to be in.",2
118550,"The air inside the car will get stuffy overtime. If you are in it, your sweat glands make it warmer. The engine heats up the car as well.",2
118551,I think that it is colder in the car because when it stays outside for a while the cold air goes through the glass.,2
118547,If the car has all the windows down and the sun hits the glass it will make it warmer than the outside air ,2
118560,The air warmer in the car because the sun is shining directly at the car.,2
118568,como acentroid hai aide atrapado poco a poco se emfria ,2
118553,it's going to be hotter because it's not been droven since a week so it's been in the sun.,2
118546,"When a car is left not running in the sun, the car absorbs the heat and traps it in. Even in just one day the car can reach temperatures of over 100 degrees. Furthermore, leaving it in the sun for seven days (a week) everyday will just add on to the heat making it hotter than the outside hair.",3
118538,It would be warmer because the heat from yesterday would stay in your car.,2
118552,i donot know,1
118563,It depends on the weather of the whole week and the weather of today.,2
118555,I got that the inside of the car is warmer because if Akbar parked his car in the sun in a cold day and he does not drive it for a week and the car is parked at the same place the car will get warmer then outside.The car is also warmer because the sun reflects to the glass and from the glass it may reflect to the inside of the car.,2
118569,I think that my answer is a good answer because if the day and weather are both cold so the car would also be cold.,2
118571,"since the car has been in the cold for a day,it is probably still cold.",2
118559,i dont know,1
118564,Because the outside is hot so the car will get hot in a few minutes.,2
118570,I think that that the the temperature will be the same as the outside air because the air will cool down the suns energy which makes the car the same temperature as outside.,3
118585,it will be cooler because its cold at night and it hasnt been used for a couple od days,2
118590,I think this is the answer because the air temperature outside the air will get inside from air pockets in the car.,2
118575,the sun is warming the leather inside the car and when the door opens the hot air rises and makes the air hot.,2
118594,"well the cold from outside the cars door has a line witch the cold might come in the little line of air.
",2
118586,"The car will be colder because you have kept the car outside for a week ,so the temperature will go up.",2
118595,It will be warmer because if it hasn't been use and the Windows are close the air in the car has been warmed up.,2
118578,I believe that the temperature inside a car is colder than it is outside because it has some what of a metal base and personally whenever its warm i believe the metal is warmer and whenever its cold i believe the metal is colder. So on a cold day inside of the car should be colder.,2
118593,"I think it is warmer than the air outside because its a cold day and he hasn't drove it in one week, but he parked it in the sun so it might be a little warmer than the air outside.  ",2
118582,because theirs no where the car can go so the air gets warmer and warmer and warmer,2
118587,l think the air in the car will be colder than the air outside because the cold air is inside the the car ,2
118588,Because it depends on how cold the air is on that kind of situation.,2
118589,If Akbar hasn't driven his car for a week and the temperature outside is cold  than that day then that means that over a week the car has been sitting in the hot sun and the heat has been trapped.,2
118579,It is warmer than the outside air because it has been in the sun all day and that heats up the car.,2
118603,cause when you leave the car the temperature,2
118592,I think it is warmer because when you leave your car in  the sun it will capture the warm air and keep it inside so when you open it will be warmer when the outside is cold.,2
118584,I think it will be warmer than the air outside because none of that cold air has gotten into the car,2
118576,I think that because he can heat the car up.,2
118599,It is cold because he has not driven it yet and it is cold because it is cold outside.,2
118577,"The air outside the car affect the car because if the air is hot the car will be hot too if the air outsid e is too hot the car will be hot too.
",2
118591,it must be warmer inside the car because the hot air is trapped in the car,3
118580,the heat goes in to the car when its open and the heat gets trapped in the car and it stays hot inside.,2
118598,"I think the car will be warmer then the air outside because when the car was running there was heat so the car must've collected the heat from the sun and when it was running. Although, it might be a bit colder than it was when the sun was out and the car was on, but it's still trapping heat. ",2
118581,I believe that it's warmer inside the car because its been in the sun but it's cold outside so since the sun is directly hitting the car it will be warmer than the air outside.,2
118619,Akbar's car has every thing black in his car.,2
118608,"The temperature will be exactly the same as the outside air.For example, when ever you park your car on a sunny spot it is always hot and same if you park it on a cooler spot.",2
118597,it is exactly the same as outside because the sun is is heating outside and it is also heating the car,2
118630,is warmer than out because the car is all the day clouse,2
118583,because the sun counter acts the cold day,2
118637,because it was parked in the  sun light it trap the heat in the car,3
119017,If its a cold day than your car is going to have to be cold if it's surrounded by cold air.,2
118296,"Even if it was in the sun, it would still be colder in the car than outside because it was cold outside and the car was sitting there for a week.",2
118300,Because the windows are down and the temperature is really hot inside the car.,2
118302,"I think that it will be warmer than the outside air because it says "" Akbar walks to his car that is parked in the Sun and has not been driven for a week."" It also says "" On a COLD day..."", but it never said how cold the weather was on the week that he didn't drive his car. The sentance also states that the car was parked in the Sun for a whole week, so that might effect the temp of the inside of the car.",2
118310,It would be the same temp. than outside because its been outside and it was a cold day and the sun wouldn't change the temp. inside the car because it was cold day and the cold weather would not change the weather inside.,2
118304,The sun produces solar radiation which heats up the car and the infrared radiation gets trapped in the car which leads to the temperature rising.,5
118313,The car will absorb sunlight/ radiation and will heat up the car more than the outside air.,3
118319,It would be warmer because the car would trap the heat inside the car like the solar oven would trap the heat when it was hot out and keep the heat in the car.,3
118297,Because the sun has made the inside of the car warmer than the air outside of the car.,2
118298,Its because the car is in the sun for a week and the sun is hitting the car for a long time that why I think it will be warmer than the air outside.,2
118311,the air is colder than the outside air because which ever kind of tempature stays the longest gets traped inside the car then the outside air gets warmer.,2
118305,i know that because it says that the car has been parked in the sun for a week.,2
118293,Well since the car holds the temperature of out side and so the temperature  of the car would be the same temperature or colder as the outside air.,2
118299,Well if you think about when you go inside a car in the morning its really cold and when you go outside in the middle of the day its pretty hot but all in all it all depends on tempiture ,2
118309,because if the sun is reflecting into the car it would be the same temp as the nsun,2
118307,Because there are places from were air can come in.,2
118306,i think that the car will be colder than the outside air  ,2
118308,The sun shined on the parked car and the inside of the car would be warmer then the outside air,2
118321,The sun produced a lot of solar radiation in the car and a lot of infaired radiation is trapped inside the car.,4
118312,The air inside the car is warmer than the outside air because the solar radiation should of transform into heat.,4
118318,#N/A,2
118303,the inside has trapped solar radiation heat in the car for a week through the window.  ,3
118314,0,1
118301,I think that it's warmer than the outside because it's been sitting there for days in the sun.,2
118316,i think that it would be coulder than the out side air because it is could out side,2
118320,"I chose this because if it is parked in the sun for a week,the car shouldn't have the same temperature as outside.",2
118294, The inside air and the outside air are the exact same temperature because the sun is not enough to heat the inside if the car.,2
118315,"over time the heat would have stayed in the car heating the car up over time, so even though its still cold outside it will be warm in the car",2
118323,It actually depends on the matirial in the car because if the car seats are leather.,2
118482,because it has been parked in the sun for a week.,2
118478,When the it cold outside the car can get cold when it is hot outside it is sweltering.,2
118479,it is hotter because the sun is hitting the car,2
118480,"I think that its a little bit warmer because it was a cold day but they parked there car in the sun, so the suns heat made the car a little warmer.",2
118473,because if its cold out side it must be cold in the car there might be a window open in the car slightly open or it might of absorbed the air in to the car ,2
118474,the outside air will be the same exact temperature as the inside of the car because there are openings inside the car and that will let the cold air/hot air come threw and that's how the temperature will stay the same ,2
118483,The glass makes the heat even hotter as the Sun shines on the car's windows.,2
118470,I think that it is colder than the outside air because the cold air can be trapped inside which will cause it to be cold. ,2
118472,I think it would be warmer because I'm pretty sure that the windows would be closed and the heat would be trapped inside because even though the temp. is cold that doesn't mean there isn't a sun outside.,3
118468,"I think it would be warmer because the car kept the heat inside of the air making it so the air inside of the car would be hotter than the outside hear, where as if a door was open the air would be the same temperature as the outside air.",2
118475,The sun would have heated up the inside of the car.  The car has not been driven for a long time so it has more time to absorb heat.,2
118477,I think that the car inside will be hot temperature because when you havent used a car for a while and its been out in the sun the whole time the inside of your car will get hot.,2
118465,"The air has zero reflectivity, so it absorbs more solar radiation than the car, which has a reflective metal surface.",3
118487,the car is in the sun and the car absorbs the heat so its hotter,2
118488,Since the weather outside is hot and it hasn't been used in a week it might be a little bit hotter than the temp outside because of the sun refelecting on the cars glass  ,2
118486,I chose that because the car was parked in the sun which means the sun gave the car more heat than the outside. Also it wasn't driven for a week and it was under the sun for a week which means it must have been hot in the car.,2
118484,"I think this because,every time I go in my car and it is cold out it is colder then it is outside.?",2
118485,since there is no heat outside there would be no way for the car to be hot.,2
118490,"i think it will be warmer than outside because if the sun was facing it would get hot inside and the cold air is trapped outside
",2
118467,It may be the same as the outside because when its night the car can cool down and then the next day the car can get warmed up again.,2
118471,The Solar Radiation is heat up the inside of the car and the Infrared Radiation has less places to escape so it has a higher chance of becoming and the more heat the hotter it is in the car.,4
118469,the car hasn't been used for so long that the engine is cold making the car cold,2
118466,There are small cracks inside the car like the doors and windows so the air can get in.,2
118543,it is going to be colder because the coldness is going to go inside of the car and mix the cold air and the hot air together but then the heat is going to be gone because there is so much cold air that the car will turn cold,2
118515,I think it would be warmer in the car than the outside because the glass atracts all the hot air in the car and most of the hot air stays inside.,2
118517,the metal on the car attracts heat and traps it inside the car.,2
118533,"the inside of the car will be hotter because it traps the heat in from earlier in the day, and it is insulated.",2
118518,I think that the car will be colder than the air outside because the car will trap in the air that is outside and have the air in the car become colder than the air outside.,2
118548,I think it will be the same because the outside air is where the car is in the sun my be hitting it but the coldness will balence it our,2
118522,it would be colder because there are little cracks that air can come in,2
118562,it would be warmer than the outside air because if the car hasn't been driven for a week and its been in the sun the whole time the car will absorbe the heat and scence there is know way the heat can get out of the car the heat will just keep building up.,3
118526,"I know this because if the car is parked in the sun but it is cold outside then the heat from the sun would go in to the car and the cold air would stay in the car.Also the cold air would mix with the hot air and make it kind of warm,but warmer then outside.",2
118567,"It will be exactly the same as the outside air because even though the heat from the sun will get in, the air outside is cold, so it cools the car down. also.",2
118516,I think it is warmer inside then outside because the car was parked in the sun.,2
118521,it will be warmer because the hot air from the outside goes into the car and gets trapped so the car will be warmer then the outside air.,2
118520,#N/A,1
118514,"Akbar's car will be warmer than the outside air, because his car has been absorbing heat for the last week.",2
118512,The car is sealed and will take in solar radiation.,3
118509,It has been sitting in the cold and absorbed the cold air.,2
118534,"because you have air conditioning 
",2
118519,Because the car gets the heat and then the car keeps the heat until you put the air conditioner and cools it down or you pull the window down.,2
118511,I think this because if you park your car in the sun on a cold day the the car will be exsactly the same because cars in the morning are sometimes cold like mine. ,2
118542,I think this because if its warmer inside the inside of the car will try to be the same temperature as the outside.,2
118537,I think that it would be colder because the temperature can warm up with the sun outside but inside there is not anything to make it warm up with.,2
118529,"It is warmer because since it was parked out in the sun for a week the car is heated and unlike out side it was one day it was out in the cold. So the radiation inside , there is a lot. ",3
118536,the solar energy from the day Akbar left his car was stored.,3
118523,0,1
118530,I think warmer than the air outside because maybe the solar light absorbed the air that is in the outside of the car.,3
118510,Because heat gets trapped in the materials and kept in through the glass. But at the same time when I get in the car in the morning its colder. So i'm confused.,3
118513,It is warmer because it has been absorbing sunlight and it traps the heat inside.,4
118556,I think it will be warmer because the car was parked in the sun for a week.,2
118549,i think that it will be hot because if you leave a door open the hot air will stay inside and if there is nothing open then the cold air will not get inside,2
118607,the cold atmosphere around the car will cool the car down but the sun shining in the car will heat up the inside so i predict the car will be the warmer then the outside air.,2
118622,I think it will be warmer than the outside of the car because not all of the days were cold probally cold and the car has not been opened yet.,2
118604,"the air is cold but the car is under the sun so ithink that the tempretues would balance out
",2
118614,if your car is in the heat then the heat get into the car since there is glass keeping the heat inside the car the car will be hotter than the outside.,3
118628,"It is warmer because it absorbed the heat from the sun and there will still be heat in the car, just like the solar ovens.",3
118632,"      I think that it will be warmer because its in the sun





",2
118602,i think it will be colder because the car has not been driven for a week so how is the car suppost to stay warm ,2
118600,When it is cold the car takes in the coolness.,2
118623,I think it will be warmer than the outside air because it has been in the sun.,2
118613,its been in the sun for a week and they didnt say the other days were cold,2
118610,well it could be hot but this is a cold day.,2
118618,"It will be the same as the outside temperature because even though it was in the sun, the air surrounding it is cold.",2
118626,     I think it is warmer than the outside air because the sun is reflecting the car and if it reflects the car it might obsorve or reflect but most likely to obsorve the heat.,3
118621,because it has been siting in there for a week in the sun and there is nothing to protect it from the heat so the car will probaly be warmer,2
118611,#N/A,1
118606,it is colder because the air was trapped in the car all night and the car abosorbed the warmth so now all the warmth is gone and there is only cold.,2
118620,its the same because it is cold not warm and if it is warm it gets hot.,2
118616,I predicted colder than the outside air because the car has not been driven for a week and it is a cold day.The temperature of the cold air leads energy into the car.,2
118601,It would be warmer than the outside air because not all the cold air is being absorbed.,2
118615,"Because when you leave it for 1 week, then the car gets really hot and burns when you touch,and when you get in the inside of the car,its probably getting hotter than the outside air.",2
118624,"I chose this answer because if the sun has been shining on the car for a week, the sun has just shone its light on the car, not in the car. This means that the top of the car is warmer, not the inner part of the car.",3

118612,you can put the warm air in the car,2
118947,"If the car is parked in the sun it should be hot but if it hasn't been driven in a week,the engine would have cooled down by then thus cooling down the car.",2
118344,It would be warmer because it is in the sun and it heats up the car.,1
118337,I chose my answer because on a normal temperature day the car would be warmer than the outside but the temperature was cooler than a normal day so the car was heated up by the sun but cooled down by the temperature of the air outside.,1
118358,because the question said cold and hot so it is cold outside and warm inside the car.,1
118350,It is warmer because the heat from the sun has gotten into the car but the cold air hasn't.,2
118353,Because it has not bin used for a week and the weather outside is cold.,2
118346,because a close space car will obverse the heat and the car will stay warm.,2
118366,The car has been left in the path of solar radiation rays that have been trapped in the car and the solar radiation have transformed into heat.,4
118352,"The car's source of heat is it's engine when the car is running. So if the engine was turned off, the car will either be colder then the air outside or exactly the same as the air outside.",2

118338,"I think that the temperature will be cold in the car but, warmer than the outside air just because a car is a closed space, unless any of the windows are open but thats beside the point.",2
118348,colder because at night the cold air gets in but not out during the day.,2
118349,when its cold ouside and the car traps the coldness then when its gets warm outside the car stays cold,2
118354,because the car was in the sun so it wont be as cold as outside so it will be a little warmer then outside.,2
118351,The warmth goes inside the car and stays inside the car and the cold air goes out of the car.,2
118361,I think it is warmer because he did not drive it for a week so it should be hot because In the morning the car is not that hot later on it gets hot from in side so I think it should be hot but it could be the same as well.,2
118345,This is the find because the car is not running so the cold air gathers on the inside. This is because if you open the door the cold air will get inside and it will make the air colder.,2
118341,"the car has been sitting in warm air for a week. The SR and IR will enter, and be trapped inside the car.",4
118367,because on a cold day Akbar walks to his car and he was parked in the sun he haven't droven it for a week,2
118343,"Since it's a cold day, the car will be cold as well because outside, even though the car was parked in the sun, it's still cold.",2
118357,because it would ceap some heat in the car.,2
118369,#N/A,1
118339, I chose warmer because only a little bit of outside air can come into the car and just because today is a cold day doesn't mean the whole week was cold.,2

118360,"the air from outside will afect the air on the inside,and the sun will keep the car from becoming colder than the outside air.",1
118356,even though the car us in the sun it still doesn't give enough detail so it would be colder,2
118347,It is hot because it stayed in the sun so the heat went inside the car so thats why its hot inside.,2
118371,I think that the answer is the air will be warmer than the air outside because the car is in the sun and if the car is in the sun it will get hot. ,2
118368,water than outside air,2
118364,because the cold gets trapped in the car and can not escape ,2
118362,#N/A,1
118397,I think this because when I went in my dads car like this it was the same temperature as outside.,2
118393,  It is warmer than the outside air because the sun is powerful and the car was parked in the sun. The car aborsed the heat and the glass would let out a little of that heat and the rest would stay inside. ,3
118417,because if u turn on the heater the air will heat down.,2
118403,It would be colder then the outside air because during the nights it gets cold and if it is a cold day it would get even colder.,2
118410,It is hotter than the outside air beause the outside air hase heat evrey whair and the hot air in the car istraped inside so it dosent escape.,2

118408,because any sun would heat it up,2
118409,it is hotter because of the sun and make the seat hot,2
118401,Because it probably obsorbed the solar energy from the sun so it would stay warm.,3
118405,i think it will be colder because there is air inside the car and the could not get out and its been traped in there for a long time so the could only change so that is why i think it will be colder,2
118402,colder because it has been out there overnight ,2
118406,The solar radiation would go through the metal and would stay in the car when the outside air wouldn't be able to get inside.,3
118400,it will be hotter because nobody has been in it for a week,2
118415,"The car would be warmer than the outside air because when it was hot, the car would be hot. And when Akbar comes to the car, the heat is still in the car.",2
118398,I think colder then the outside air because the temperature of outside goes in the car and it gets colder.,2
118395,It will be warmer because the heat inside stays in which makes it hot and the outside air stays the same.,3
118412,i know this because if it is cold outside and the sun is out who knows if it was hotter yesterday or cold yesterday so if it is cold today and it was warm yesterday it can be the exact tempurature.,2
118391,"When a car hasn't been driven for a week, that means no heat from the car can get in. On a COLD day and it hasn't been driven for a week, coldness will go onto the car and windows and the cold will be let in and it hasn't been driven for a week so the temperature would be even colder.",2
118411,It is a cold day so it makes it cold. Then the heat from the sun makes it warmer so it is exactly like the outside air.,2
118407,The sun will tranfort heat into the car.,3
118414,The car keeps heat in.,2
118418,"It is the same because there is no heat to warm it up, except the sun that would keep it the same temperature.",2
118416,The car would be hot then the out side because the heat goes in but does not go out,2
118396,it will be colder because since the air cant get out it can only change so since it was on a cold day it will be cold ,2
118419,I think that exactly the same as the outside air because it hot everyday outside.,2
118404,if is hot outside then is hot inside the car and if is cold outside then inside is cold ,2
118439,It is warmer because the windshield acts as a magnifying glass and heats the with allowing minimal cold air in and heats the car.,2
118437,"since the car was left outside for a while the hot air probly got trapped in there.



 ",2
118438,"If there were no windows open in Abkar's car it would be normal room temperature in the car. If it was cold outside, it would have to be colder outside.",2
118443,"The air inside the car would be colder because the solar radiation might have reflected off the car from the paint, and the air around the car is cold too",3
118456,It's warmer because the windows and doors are blocking most of the air out.,2
118455,the car contains the heat,3
118446,"It will be colder because even though its been parked in that spot for days, the sun changes position. The sky starts to get dark at around 8 and gets lighter at 6. That's 10 hours of guaranteed cold air. The other 14 hours may very from cold to hot to kind of warm. So more than likely the car will start out cold from that night and stay cold because it's a cold day.",2
118440,I think it is colder in the car because the coldness comes from the outside air and stays on the out side of the car making the coldness stay inside,2
118451,It will be warmer because I've been sitting in the Sun for a week.,2
118462,it would be hotter because all of that solar radiation has been trapped in the car  ,4
118442,because the sun will heat up the leather on the seats even on a cold day,2
118447,It will be warmer because the suns heat is trapped in the car.,2
118441,"If the car had been driven that week, the air would be the same. But since it has not been driven for a whole week, the car would be extra cold.",2
118452,i think this because the car has been sitting in the hot sun for a week,2
118461,I think it is warmer because it has been parked in the sun for a week and the heat is trapped inside like a solar oven.,3
118460,Well I chose this answer because well the sun hits the car but the sun is not that hot to the cold temp because it will just melt the snow or ice. ,2
118464,its going to be cold because,2
118453,It is warmer in the inside because the car was closed and the outside is colder and doesnt get in the car.,2
118458,The car has only kept the heat and not the solar radiation.,4
118454,"It has absorbed all this cold air so its really cold. :3

",2
118457,If it is on a cold day it would be colder inside the car because the cold air gets trapped in the car,2
118445,"If the car has been sitting in the cold, all of the heat from the car will have left.",2
118450,"I think the air inside the car would be warmer than the air outside because even though the air outside is cold, the air inside the car would be warmer because the air was trapped inside the car for a long period of time. The warms the air that has been trapped inside.",2
118459,It the exactly because ti reflect the tempeture from outside.,2
118463,because the car traps the heat in the car.,3
118448,Warmer because the car will trap in the heat.,3
118444,"Since there is not a lot of sun or radiation in the air to heat up the car, the car will stay the same as the outside.",3
118476,I think that the outside air is the same as the inside air because it is reflecting into the inside of the car even though the windows are shut or opened ,2
118481,the cold air gets through the pipes and vents so when he gets into his car it will be colder in the morning.,2
118535,"If the car was left outside for a week in a hot temperature and this one day was cold, its more than likely that the car is going to be warmer than the cold air outside.",2
118540,I choose this answer because the air inside the car con't get out because the car hasn't been driven for a long period of time and the windows are closed so the air can't get out.,2
118544,the air cant escape so the air inside just jets warmer than the outside air,2
118527,"i think it will colder then the outside air because it is cold out side so it will be cold inside
",2
118557,Since its a cold day it doesn´t matter that the sun is out so the temperature is the same.,2
118528,if it is cold then the air gets in faster than light does through the small windows,3
118531,I think this because the heat of the sun shines into the car and then the glass would trap the heat inside of the car making the temperature inside the car hot.  ,3
118524, I think the temperature in the inside the car would be warmer than the outside because the car has been sitting in the sun for days absorbing heat.,2
118545,If the outside air is warm than that heats the car and then the heat stays inside and that is why it is warmer inside the car. Also the air outside is moving the wind and that is why it is more hot inside than outside.,2
118558,It is going to be hotter than outside because it has been in the sun for a whole week.,2
118561,It won't really matter how long the car outside it matters what the temperature of the day is.,2
118525,it is warmer in the car because it is a close space,2
118539,the hot air gets trapped in the car.,2
118554,the sun heats up the car so the air is warmer.,2
118566,"I think the temperature inside the car is the same as the the one on the outside, because now it is parked in the sun, but it has not been in the sun for the entire week. In the night there is no sun and maybe there was one or more cloudy days or maybe the sun was not pointing at the car.",2
118565,Its because it captures the heat in the car and warms the inside.,2
118550,"The colors of the car attract heat, and the heat gets trapped in the car.",2
118551,It will be warmer in the car because it was parked in the sun for a week.,2
118547,I think because the hotter the outside air reflects on the inside air the sun is reflecting,2
118560,it will be warmer inside the car because the sun is shining inside the car.,2
118568,porque ce emfria adentro,2
118553,It's going to be colder because the warm and the cold air mix it is going to be warmer.,2
118546,"I chose this because I am going to assume that the other days of the week were pretty warm, even if they were not the car was still in the sun which would make the car warm. Although the temperature would've have dropped a little because of the air on the cold day.",2
118538,Every time I go in my mom´s car it a lot hotter in the inside then the outside on a hot day.,2
118552,i don't know,1
118563,"If you have not driven your car for a week,then the heat will accustom to the outside's heat.",2
118555,I think that it will be warmer then the air outside because the air is trapped inside a hot car in a hot day and the sun will reflect strait down to the glass which will make the inside of the car hotter.,3
118569,"colder because it was in the sun but then it was really cold  on the outside and the car is always the same temputure as outside
",2
118571,Well if the car has been in the cold environment for that day then it should have been the same temperature as outside.,2
118559,jonathan hernandez22 77ghyuhyuiuhi,1
118564,When you leave the car over nights and its cold and the morning its cold.,2
118570,0,1
118585,its warmer than out side because theres some wam air inside the car.,2
118590,The car is warmer than the outside air because the suns energy is absorbed by the car so the cars air must be hotter than the air outside of the car.,3
118575,The sun is directly entering the car and has not been open.,2
118594,because if you put your car that you haven't drove for a while then the suns rays well hit the windshield and it will make it warmer,3
118586,"The car is like the solar oven,Akbar has put his car outside for a week in the sun,so the sun's heat is getting in the car.",3
118595,When you havent opened the car for a week  the air gets hotter and then that makes the car warm inside.,2
118578,If you leave a car in cold weather for a week theirs nothing keeping the inside of the car at all warm  so the the metal exterior is not going to heat up the inside at all.,2
118593,"It is exactly the same because it is a cold day, and I know he parked it in the sun, but he hasn't drove his car in a week.",2
118582,because the air in the car will get contained and get heated,3
118587,i think that it will be the same as the air outside because it is a cold day and he parked it in the sun so it must be in the same air outside and inside.  ,2
118588,Because the windows only keep physical things out but is a entrance for heat or cold.,2
118589,If the car has been sitting in the sun for a week and on that cone cold day when akbar walks to his car the car will most likely be hot because the heat is trapped in the car from the week.,3
118579,It is warmer because the car traps the heat which keeps it warm.,3
118603,"because if the car is parked in the and it is not coverd with light colors the it will get hot




",3
118592,It is the same as the outside. An example can be let say on a hot day and havent driven your car and it is hot because the car is asorbing the hot. Just like its happening the cold air in the carthat has been driven for a week. ,3
118584,I chose this answer because heat will collect inside the car.,2
118576,I think this because the the car heats up.,2
118599,I think it is colder because when I get in the car in the morning it is cold.,2
118577,#N/A,1
118591,IT will be hotter inside because the heat will be trapped inside.,3
118580,it is warmer because the heat get traped and the heat cant go out and it will get hotter.,3
118598,It would be warmer than the outside air because it still has some heat left from the sun.,2
118581,It will be warmer than outside because the sun is beaming on it and giving it heat.,2
118619,Every thing is black in/on the car and all the other days it was warmer.,2
118608,The temperature will be warmer than the air outside cause the paint that is on the car will be absorbed and it will have the heat in and so the inside air will be warmer.,2
118597,his car will be hot because it as parked in the sun for a hole week.,2
118630,It is batter because if out side is more cold than the car have to be warmer.,2
118583,because it would store up the coldness,2
118637,because it was not driven for a week.,2
119017,The car is surrounded by cold air so it will be freezing on the inside.,2
136389,"I think that the temperature inside the car will be warmer. There are a couple of reasons why I think this. My first reason is that it was parked in th sun. The sun probably heated up the car. If the air outside is cold, then the car would be warmer since it is in the sun. ",2
136362,The air particles can not spread around they are locked in the car and do not move around which will be warmer if they are locked in. The sun went into the car and stayed in there.,3
136368,Well if you have all the windows closed and you have been in the sun all week it would be hotter because all the hot air from the sun would be trapped in the car. since it was a cold day that day he got to his car it wouldn't be as hot on warmer days.,2
136372,In a car the air gets in through the windows and the air vents which makes it colder because it goes through the air conditioner vent.,2
136352,It can be warmer than the air outside because the car probably won't let the heat it collected out as easy and metal is a good conductor for heat so that would be why it is warmer.,3
136382,The car is made of metal so conduction of heat makes it hotter.,2
136374,I think it will be the same because there is no sun to beam on the car.,2
136356,"I think that it would be warmer than the outside air because it has been parked outside more amount of days in the sun than in than it was in the cold. It says that it was parked in the sun and hasn't been driven in a week. Than it says that he walked outside on a cold day, assuming it was only one cold day,and walked to his car.",2
136370,I think it is going to be warmer than the outside because the sun has been shining on the car all day long that the car will get hot because the sun is shining on it.The heat from the sun will heat the car up.,2
136354,When the car is out in the sun because there is no new air it gets hotter because there in moister.,2
136367,in the car its colder than the outside air because the air conditioner is when you bring in cool air in the car. but outside is warm enough to use the air conditioner.,2
136388,I think the air inside the car is going to be warmer based on personal experience. On a hot day my mom and I had to go somewhere and the day before we didn't even use the car. In was sitting in the sun and it was really hot inside. I had to leave my door open while I was waiting for my mom to hurry up.,2
136683,i went in to my sissters car yester day and she had not divein her car in a long time and it was not hot or cold so i am geseing from edspereants,2
136369,The car has been sitting outside in the hot sun for a week.So I think that the car has collected lots of heat energy while sitting outside in the sun.,3
136378,It is warmer in the car because the car is holding the warm air inside when outside the air is moving warm to cold. ,3
136359,Most cars tend to be warmer because the car that was already in the car is trapped inside and then a bunch of heat is going straight on to the car which makes it even hotter.,2
136390,"I had picked the last answer ""Exactly the same as the outside air"" because even though it is a cold day, and he parked his car in the sun his car is hot because the sun is directly on the car.",2
136375,Because when ever i go into my car in the morning it is always colder then outside. ,2
136384,"Even if it was a cold day outside, the sun was shining on the car heating it up.",2
136387,The car will obsorb heat from the sun resulting in the air being hotter.,2
136366,Because it would heat up because  when it's cold things also tend to heat up and because the sunlight is reflected off and hitting the car.,3
136363,It's what's present not what happened prior to him walking to his car.,2
136373,I picked this answer because it depends of how hot it is outside because it could cause how hot it is inside the car.But it can get really hot inside a car.,2
136360,Because it has isolation from the air and wind outside which makes it much cooler.,2
136364,The car will heat up in the sun and the heat will get trapped in the car causing the car to be warmer.,2
136380,"The temperature all week was probably not cold. The sun still shined through the clouds and traps it insides, making is car a little warmer",2
136391,I think this because when you close a microwave the air from the outside comes in and then it warms it up.I also think this because the machine can warm up the thing you want it to cook.,2
136379, It cools down with the air around it.,2
136377,i said exactly the same because when it is cold outside your car gets coolder and when it is hot your car gets warmer ,2
136381,"I think it is Exactly the same as the outside air because when I go inside my car on a COLD day, it is the same temperature as outside.",2
136361,As the car sits in the drive way the sun will warm it up and store heat inside when it is a cold day.,2
136685,A lot of cars have a dark colored coat of paint on it so it absorbs more light. That heats the car up. ,4
136419,The heat that was used from the engine was trapped inside the car over night so when the car is opened it is warmer than the outside air,2
136415,this has happened to me before so i know because my family has a lot of cars and most of them don't work all the way so if need to use a car that we haven't used in  while the car is gonna be hot on the inside (unless its winter).,2
136395,Heat goes to the colder object. Therefore the heat will travel to the car until the car and the outside air are the same temperature.,2
136393,"It will be the same temperature as it is outside, as the cold air outside will cool it off, and the sun will warm it up, making it the same temperature. ",2
136408,"Whenever I enter my car on a cold day, it is always colder. I think it is colder because there is no heat reflecting and being absorbed through the window into the car.",2
136421,The sun is shining into the car and heating it up.,2
136404,"I belive the air in the car is warmer because when the air is trapped in the car, it has no where to go so the air is moving around quickly- and that warms the car up.",2
136420,It is warmer because yesterday mught have been a hot day so it is still holding in all the heat from the past week.,2
136414,I think that because you have a AC (to make the car colder) and a heater (to make the car warm). ,2
136392,Since the cold air outside is bigger and surrounds all of the car then the car must be colder than the outside air.,2
136397,I think that it will warmer because I have heard that cars are 10 degrees hotter than outside.,2
136424,because it was in the sun it will absorb more light which creates more heat.    ,4
136423,"Becuase the air in your car is usually warmer than the air outside, even on cold days.",2
136403,"Even though it is cold outside, it has been sitting in the sun for a week. With the sun reflecting on it it will make the car hotter, with it just sitting.",2
136412,If your car is black it will afect the inside of the cars air warth.,2
136407,I think the car will have been heated by the sun all week.,2
136411,BECAUSE THE AIR GETS TRAPPED IN AND THE SUN IS BEATING NOW ON THE CAR AND IT IS WARMING THE AIR INSIDE THE CAR BECAUSE THE AIR CANT ESCAPE,3
136402,All the hot air adds up in the car and it gets hotter.,2
136400,Even though it is a cold day the car is in the sun and that's why it warmer.,2
136406,When you are in your car it has the same air as it doses outside. (unless you put the heater on or the AC),2
136405,I think this because if it hasn't been driven around then there can really be a lot of heat in the car. Also the car might be cold because it might have absorb the coldness of the air. ,2
136416,becuase his windshield is like a magnifind glass it heats up the car,2
136409,The windows let heat into the car but do not let it out.  The windows trap heat in the car like a greenhouse.,3
136398,"His car has been parked in the sun for a week, and even if it's cold outside today doesn't mean the car will freeze that instant.",2
136418,You could have the cooler on and that makes the car cooler than the outside air and if you have the heater on the car well be hotter than the outside air and if you have nothing on and you have the windows the car will be the same temperature as the air ,2
136399,If the sun was hitting the car for a week and just today she goes into her car the air is going to be hot but the car is going to be cold outside.,2
136417,It is warmer because in the morning it cold sometimes so you put on the heater on and becomes warmer in side the car.,2
136425,"I think that it will be warmer because sometimes on a hot day I will go in my mom's car that she drove 30 minutes ago and it's really hot. So if you haven't driven your car for a week, even if it's cold he parked his car in the sun for 7 days, it won't make a difference if it's a cold day. ",2
136394,Akbar's car is warmer than the outside air because it heat is trapped inside and was building up.,3
136422,I think it is warmer than the outside air because if his car was parked in the sun for a week and its a cold day his car would be warmer then outside.,2
136410,beacause it cant be colder than the outside air since its just the same air it would be the same.,2
136396,I mean it depends because when its hot outside and you want the AC on in the car then its cooler than the outside,2
136426,"It is colder, because since it has not been driven for a week, there is no energy to make it hotter. ",2
136413,"The sun has been on the car, so the car has absorbed the heat since it has not been driven for a week.",2
136453,I think the temperature would be colder inside the car since there would not be a lot of sunlight for the car to absorb or reflect off of. Usually it depends on the weather. Also since the air would be cold it would cool the car down.,3
136451,Most cars from the 21st century have insulators in the inside roof of the car,2
136462,If the windows are not open and the sun was on the car for a whloe week it will be very hot. ,2
136481,"If the engine has not been turned on for a whole week , the I predict that the car will be a little bit warmer than the temperature as the outside surroundings. Why I think this is because the engine usually heats up the front of the car and if Akbar (owner of the car) felt cold he would of turned off the heater inside the car and it will have a different temperature for quite a while.",2
136460,"Depending on the windows in the car, the heat will go through the window and not reflect. If it goes through and you have no sunshade your car will be warmer than outside. It's warmer because now the heat has no wear to go and is trapped in your car. ",3
136457,"This is not the best explanation, but yeah. It's warmer in the car possibly since the car's exterior is made out of metal. The heat from the sun probably is absorbed by the car's exterior and is stored into the interior of the car.",2
136459,If it's like 50 degrees outside your car is probably going to be 35 degrees because the temperature drops in certain climates like it's the same for hot weather because if it's 100 degrees your car is probably going to be 105 or less but it isn't like the air is it's just that the metal attracts the sun and it makes everything hot or cold.,2
136476,I chose colder than the outside air because I have had that happen to me.,2
136456,"Well if the car has been sitting outside on a cold day, the car will not have had the sun to warm it up outside so, it will be cold inside of the car.",2
136483,I think it is going to be warmer than the outside air because not all of the cold air is going to go into the car that is why i think it will be warmer than the outside air.,2
136463,It would be the same temperature because they are in the same place.,2
136450,The metal of the car will keep in the heat that has already been in it.,2
136482,Because in that week if there was a hot day the car would of gotten hot then since the car is like an oven it would stay hot if it was hot on one of those days.,2
136467,"The sun gives the car a warm temperature formaybethe first day, but the wind makes the car colder over many days,so the car is colder.",2
136454,Well i think that the air in a car is colder because the sun is shinning on it. ,2
136465,I this because the car could be black that absorbs the heat from the sun. ,2
136477,it will be warmer than the outside air because it has not driven for a week and has not moved places at all.,2
136468,If its really hot outside the temperature in the car is the same as the outside just like it was cold outside. in the morning the car is cold so that means if the temperature is cold or hot it is the same temperature as outside.,2
136461,the light has been reflecting off the car for a week and it has not been being adsorbed to the inside making the air outside hotter,3
136475,I think it is Colder than the outside air because the sun is outside and the  sun can warm up outside but not inside the car.,2
141559,well it depends on how light or dark the car is.if it is black it will oxorb heat to the inside of the car. if it it white it will deflect heat makeing it coler,2
136485,I think it's warmer because when it's sunny and you have your car outside wear the sun reflects your car and makes it more hotter than before . When it's sunny and your car is outside it's going to be really warm when you get in.  ,2
136452,The sun beats down on the car and makes it warmer.,2
136471,because the materal in the car will atract heat and make the car warmer.,2
136474,"The ""warmness"" of outside transfers to the inside of the car.",2
141560,,1
136469,"I choose this because there has been no heat in his car for a week.
",2
141561,I think this because the sun is hotter and there is no way for air to get in but the sun hits the roof of the car and  heats that up witch makes it so no air can get out making it trap all the heat. ,3
136480,Because the car is outside in the hot sun with no windows rolled down and hand hasn't been opened up to get aired out so of course it's going to feel really hot.,2
136464,The reason is because his car has been absorbing heat for a whole week which will make his car hot.,2
136455,"The air that is in the car is being trapped inside the car when the doors are closed, making it hard for air from the outside to wedge itself into the cars air, that unless of course you open your door or roll down your window, then the whole circumstances change completely.",2
136492,I think it would be colder than outside because their is Ac.  It also would be affected by the color of the car.,2
136500,"I chose this answer because the sun is beating down on the car. Which is creating a warmer temperature, then the outside air.",2
136494,I think the temperature inside the car is warmer than the outside air because the car will absorb the outside air. The outside air is cold but the car is in the sun and the car has not been driven for a week so that means the car has been in the sun for a week. Instead of the car absorbing the cold air it will absorb heat  from the sun.,2
136495,"I think that the car will be warmer because the sun has been shining on it for an entire week. Also, the car was most likely a little cooler when he was driving it a week before, so all the heat was moving into the cooler car all that time.",2
136499,"I say that the car would be colder than the outside air because if the car has been in the sun for a week but it is on a cold day, there is no warmth going into the car because the sun is reflecting off the car. Thus, keeps the cold air inside of the car.",2
136489,"I say that it would be colder than the outside air because since the inside hasn't had much heat absorbed inside of the car, also because the car hasn't been turned on in a week, no energy has been produced to give out heat.",2
136498,"Well, the air will be warmer that the outside air because the heatwaves already in the car has been added with more hot air. The temperature outside might have changed, but the air inside doesn't change, it only gets hotter because the air is enclosed form the car so any of the hot air can't get out. ",3
136503,It would get warmer because the car traps heat in it. It also depends on the color of the car.,2
136509,Little spaces have less room to move around and the air gets warmer utill you put the air comdisaner on.,2
141563,the sun is hot so its burning the car and inside.,2
136504,I t will be warmer because it is consuming the air . It has was out in the sun  for a long time .That is why it is going to be hotter than the outside .,2
136490,In a black car it will absorb the light and heat and make the car hotter. In a white car it will get hot but not as much heat because white reflects the light and black absorbs the lights. The sun is the main source of the car heating up.The air in the car is trapped so the car gets hotter,5
136516,"I think it would be warmer then the outside air because all the air has been captured in the car for a week, and it wouldn't be able to escape unless a window was open or a door was open.",2
136507,"If the car has been sitting dormant in the sun for a week, chances are it will have absorbed more overall heat than the outside air, especially with metal tending to grow hot in the sun and since the glass of the car has magnified the heat on the interior.",2
136515,I think the temperature would be warmer than the outside air because when i get in the car after it sitting in the sun it is hot. Also because it sits in the sun an heats the car up.,2
136501,"I think this because, even though it is cold outside, it has been in the sun for a week, and it has most likely that the car has trapped all of the ""collected"" heat within it.",2
136505,"I think it is warmer, because the light from the sun goes onto the windshield, which projects the light from the sun into the car, which makes the car hotter than the outside air, making the car hotter it was before.",3
,,1
136491,I think the car would be warmer than the outside air because of the car's engine fume's.,2
136511,because all the air is trapped inside the car and the sun is shinnying in to the car and heating all the air up an making it hot.,3
136513,"Well, at first I had to think . Its a ""cold"" day, right? But its parked in the sun and hasn't moved for a week so its probably not going to be hotter in the car because the car hasn't been opened.  ",2
136502,Because if his car was a darker it will extract heat/more cold.,2
136508,"I chose warmer than the outside because at first when the was coming the car was the same temperature as the outside, but the air was stuck in the car for 2 weeks and the air did not move or change and the sun even in a cold day can change the temprature in the car.",2
136493,I think that it will be the same because although it is parked in the sun the air around the car would be affected by the sun light too and so it would be the same temperature.,3
,,1
136518,"The temperature of the air inside the car is warmer than the outside air because all thee air is trapped inside of the car. The cars engine heating up from use could change the temperature inside the car a little It also could be because the metal on the car gets heated by the sun, which affects the temperature in the car a lot.  ",2
136512,If has been sitting in the sun for over a week without touching it you would think that the sun would make the car hotter.,2
136506,I  believe the car will be hotter than the air outside because the car traps heat in. It does because the metal conducts heat.,2
136497,I think it would we warmer in the car than outside because maybe it was hot and the car obsorbed the heat from the outside. So the next day it was cold and the heat was traped in. ,2
136514,I think it was colder than the outside air because if it hasn't been driven for a week and its a cold day then there should have been enough time to make the inside of the car very cold to make it colder than outside if it has been cold all week.,2
136519,I think it would be warmer because when you leave something outside on a hot day most likely it will be very hot. ,2
136522,If the car has been sitting unused for a while then it will have accumulated heat from hot days and the sun. How hot can depend on the color of the interior of the car.,2
136496,Warmer because the heat from the sun is heating up the car.,2
136517,"I think this because heat can radiate in through windows, but cannot radiate out, so it gets hot.",3
136520,because common sense,2
136571,"Because all the heat from the sun gets trapped on the inside of the car because the shiny acts as illnunim 
foil.",2
136550,Well if you have the air conditioning on it'll be colder but if not it could be hotter as the all the heat is trapped in there.,2
136557,"The car can be shut tight, so it can trap heat. Also, it isn't exposed to the air, so the heat can act.",2
136566,The heat of the car is hotter than the outside air because the heat is trapped. It is trapped because of the type of metal the ca is. ,2
136558,It really depends on the temperature outside because if it hot outside it will be warm inside and if its cold it will be cold inside.,2
136555,The heat will go in the car through the window and once the heat goes in it won't come out.,2
136563,"It would of traped in the hot air from the sunny weather before it was cold
",3
136556,Inside the car would be warmer than the air outside because the car traps the air and bakes it. ,2
136569,"Inside the car, it would be warmer from people, body heat, or heaters. The cold air outside would make the car cooler, until the car is the same temperature as the outside air.",2
136574,I think it would be colder because If the outside is cold and it hasn't be driven for days that mean that it has no reason to be hot.,2
136565,it will be warmer then the outside air because the inside of the car has a roof and the outside would be colder because the air is less dense.,2
136561,Because the heat gets trapped in the car and stays like that until fresh outside air gets into he car.,2
136583,this is the case because the car traps the heat it gains from the outside.,2
136551,"yes, because it has been out in the sun for a week and If you have leather seats it will be hot then you when you get in the car all the metal stuff will be hot ",2
136549,"The car is warmer, because the interior is black or gray, so it absorbs all of the color, and makes the car warmer. ",3
136570,I think that the temperature would be the same as the outside air because the car has been cooled down by the cold air but it has been warmed up a bit from the sun. Since it is being cooled down but warmed up at the same time the temperature inside the car would stay around the same temperature as the outside air.,2
136560,Because the car would trap all the hot air in the car.,3
136572,the car traps the hot air,3
136559,I think it would be warmer then the outside air because the outside of the car is medal so it would get hotter on the inside because the heat would leak into the car. ,2
136564,"I think the air would be colder because even though the slightly warm air builds up heat in the car for the week, in the night, most the heat is lost.  Every day it would go up in the day and down in the night.  The day he walks to his car is cold I think the car would be colder.",2
136567,IF the car is black it will be hotter if white it will be cooler.,2
136553,because there is no air that comes into the car to cool the car so it would be hotter.,2
136546,"The car is made out of multiple materials, such as metal, and metal heats up, a lot. On a hot day, your car could potentially be an oven.",2
136580,I think that the the car would be warmer. I think this because the sun would still be out and would be absorbing or reflecting the car. Just because the day is cold doesn't mean the inside would be the same temperature.,2
136576,i think it would be colder because a car is not just sealed shut it has a way for air to get to the inside and i think if the air is colder than the air that goes into the car it will be cold since the air outside is cold.,2
136355,"I think inside of the car will be warmer because even if it's a cold day, the car is parked in the sun for a week. Just like when it's cold, your car is a little colder inside, but when it's hot, you car it a little hotter.",2
136351,It would be warmer because when the sun hits the glass of the car it creates he going into the car. But not having a way out.,3
136389,"I think that the temperature inside the car would be cooler then the outside air. The car has not been driven for a week so the car's engine has not been able to heat the car up at all. Also, it is cold outside so all of the air that goes into the car is cold making the car cooler.",2
136373,Well i really dont know because outside when its hot the car can get heated but than if its cold outside the car can get cold to.But i just put exactly the same temperature as the air outside because it can be the same temperature.  ,2
136377,because the car ventalation hooks up to the out side ,2
136366,I said it would be warmer because first off the car could be black and exorb the heat. Also it would be warmer because solar radiation would hit it hard so sense the car  isnt moving all the heat is trapped.,4
136356,"I think that it would  be colder than the outside air because it is cold right at that moment. Also the hot air affected the temperature inside the car and it got hotter. It is like how the cold air affected the temperature, how it got colder. So i think that the cars air on the inside is colder than the outside air.",2
136363,Because the heat would be in the car and the cold air would only affect the outside of the car.,2
136375,The car is a insulator so it dose not let any heat into the car. ,2
136370,"I think that it would be the exact same temp. because even though it was in the sun all week , if it becomes a cold day it is going to become cold. Proably the same temperature.",2
136391,Well it depends on the color of the car fabric and all those things that are in a car.,2
136404,"I beleave that the car would be colder then the outside air because the car has windows, so the solar energy would reflect on the windows. And it might be warm inside the car, but not as warm.",3
136411,i think it will be colder because it has not had any movement of air and it is out side for the nigh and a night the air is cold so it would make the air in the car colder .,2
136400,The car would be absorbing the heat outside.,2
136460,If the car has been sitting for a week the air would be able to seep through the car making it cooler than outside. The car has not been heated with heat for awhile and there is no place for the cold air to go. ,2
136476,I chose A because the rest the outside air is going to be colder then the air outside.,2
136462,the car heats up when the window reflicets the sun that will heat up the car. The sun`s waves heats up the car and some of the waves leave. ,3
136504,I think that it will be warmer because it is cold out side . But it is parked in the sun for a week .Also if there is hot weather it is going to be hotter .,2
136500,I think it would be colder because it is cold outside and the outside air determines the temperature. ,2
136490,when you are inside the car and it is not running there is going to be more heat. If it is black on the outside and the inside it gets hotter then if it was white.,2
136505,"It will be warmer than the outside air, because the sun gives off solar radiation which turns it into heat energy, and the car keeps the heat inside of it, so, when its outside in the sun, the car will be hotter than the outside temperature.",5
136509,Because you put the A.C on in the car.,2
136519,It would be warmer because if it was parked outside on a hot day because the sun rays get trapped in the car and turns into heat.,5
136495,It will be colder than the outside air because all of the heat from the car when it was originally parked was drained out because of the cold air on the outside. (warmer things move to cooler things),2
136550,"It should be warmer, it depends on the other days and the sun position, if it was hot on other days then it was most likely warmer then the outside air. Also, if the sun was directly on the car it would be hot from the light. One last thing is how small the car is, it traps in a lot of heat which moves around in that small space which makes it hotter.",3
136572,I chose this because the sun has been aiming at the car so the car traps the heat and when it's very hot i go in the car and its very hot inside. ,3
136557,"Outside of the car is cold, so the the car would be cold. Even if the sun is shining on it, greenhouse gases over rules albedo.",2
136563,The hot air will counter act the colder air,2
136518,"The temperature of the air inside the car is warmer than the outside air because all the air is trapped inside of the car. I think that it will be warmer because it is parked in the sun. But, it is parked in the sun for a whole week. Also, if there is hot weather it is going to be hotter. The cars engine heating up from use could change the temperature inside the car a little It also could be because the metal on the car gets heated by the sun, which affects the temperature in the car a lot. This even mostly depends on if the car is an insulator or conductor. I also think it could be exactly the same as the outside air because heat goes to the colder object. This means that the heat will travel to the car until the car and the outside air are the same temperature.    ",3
136381,"I think that Akbar's car is the exactly same temperature as the outside air because the car hasn't been driven for a week. The sun and the temperature outside doesn't affect the car's temperature. And I know because when I go in my car on a COLD day, the car's seats are as cold as ice!",2
136359,Well if the car is black then the outside is going to be hot but if the inside is all black too then the inside would be hotter because there are more things to reflect off of.,2
136372,I think it's warmer because the metal reflects the heat inside.,2
136382,"If the car is in thee sunlight it is absorbing a lot of the solar radiation that the sun is radiating making the car heat up because metal is a conductor. The car may not have gained any heat from the hot engine, but it is definitely warmer inside the car.",3
136683,it would be warmer because when he park it in the sun the car would adsorbed the heat,2
136390,I think that the air would be colder in the inside than the outside because on a cold day he parked his car in the sun and he has drove it a a week.,2
136388,"I am answering this question based off experience. On a cold morning, my mom and I went to the car that had not been driven in a few days and it was freezing.",2
136362,It would be colder than outside because there is no sun to heat it up inside like a oven. The cold air goes in the car an does not escape. It has not been on either so that means that the engine wont make the car warm. The engine makes the car hotter. But the SUn from before was making it hot except now it is a cold day with no sun.,2
136374,Because some heat has been absorbed and hasn't been let out.,3
136380,The car has been sitting in the sun so it might heat up the car a little bit so it will be hotter than the temperature outside the car.,2
136378,The warm air from the days before the cold day would keep the car warm and the car will keep the air in and so the air would be warm for Akbar when he gets in his car.,2
136367,I think it would be warmer than the outside heat because when the sun hits the car it will absorb heat because the glass will absorb the heat there for it will make the car inside warm.,2
136352,The car has not been driven and is parked on a cold day is warmer because it is parked in the sun and cars are made of metal making it a good conductor of heat. That is why it would be warmer.,2
136360,because the air outside heated it up the inside.,2
136379,The cold air outside conducts inside the car and makes it cold like outside.,2
6971,When your out of the car and everything is closed the sun is reflecting in the car.,2
136368,I think it is warmer because the heat is trapped in the car and probably doesn't have any windows open so the heat will stay in.,3
136364,The car hes been sitting in the sun for a week and the heat will be trapped inside the car.,3
136384,Even if the temp. outside is really cold the car was still parked in the sun and the windows should have magnafied the suns heat. This should make the car warmer (not by a lot) than the outside air.,2
136393,"If the car has not been driven for a week, the car will heat up the air inside the car. But due to the cold air outside, the car will be cold inside, and the cold air will be heaten up by the sun. This will make the air slightly warmer than the air outside.  ",2
136413,"The car was in the sun longer than it was in the cold, it has also not been used at all.",2
136394,The cars air would warmer than the outside air because the heat has been trapped in the car.,3
136405,I think it's going to be warmer inside the car because it is taking in the heat and is keeping some of it in the car. This keeps the car warm.,3
136423,On cold days mycar is usuallycolder then the air outside.,2
136398,"I chose this answer because it's been parked in the sun all week, and the glass/windshield absorbed the heat in the atmosphere and that means it will be warm when you get in.",2
136414,I think that it wold be warmer than the outside air because it had been counselled. ,2
136408,,1
136420,"If the car has been in the sun the for a week without moving then it is probably hotter than the air around it. I say this because maybe the rest of the days that the car has been there were hot and that air went inside the car and is still there so the heat is trapped. Also, maybe the sun being on the car on a cold day keeps the car warmer.",2
136419,The heat from the sun has been trapped inside the car thus the air inside the car is warmer then than the air outside.,2
136424,It will stay the warmer because the car is made of metal and it will absorb the cold and the light. It will be warmer but it wont be very noticeable.,3
136392,Since the cold air outside is surrounding the car more then the car will conduct more of that cold air and get colder than the outside. It's like when I get in the car to go to school and it's cold in the morning the car feels colder than the outside air.,2
136426,"Because if you haven't driven your car in a week, and the air outside is cold, then it is the same temperature.",2
136685,The car is made of metal and metal is a conductor and a conductor produces heat.  ,2
136403,"I think his car is colder than the outside air , because it has been sitting in the sun for a week, but it was cold a old day when Akbar went to his car. Even though the sun is shining on it and it it hasn't been driven for a week it is still probably colder than the outside air.  ",2
136422,I feel like it would be warmer than outside air because the car has been in the sun for a week and hasn't been driven.  All the car as absorbed the heat from that week.,2
136416,the heat is being trapped inside of the car then coiling up that heat until it can be released,3
136425,"The inside of the car is going to be exactly the same as the outside air because when I go into the car in the morning and it's cold outside it's cold inside the car too, then we have to make the car warmer. It's been in the sun for a week but it hasn't been turned on. For me that's just a day so if it was in the sun for a week it's going to be cold.",2
136395,"Since heat always travels to the colder object, heat will transfer to the car until the car and the outside air are the same temperature.",2
136474,"The metal conducts heat, even if it is cold, because cold is heat.",2
136467,"I chose exactly the same as the outside air because since it was a cold day and not warm, the car did not have any heat to absorb.",2
136463,"I think the air will be cold because, its been sitting in the cold air all day.",2
136483,I think it is warmer inside than the outside is because the heat is going to go to the inside of the car to warm up and the outside of the car is on the outside so it is going to be the same temperature as the outside air and the inside is going to be warmer because all the heat is going to be stuck inside roaming around stuck until someone opens it.,3
136461,The heat would be trapped in the car and the outside of the car would be freezing because all the heat is being trapped in the car,3
136465,It will be colder because he hasn't drove it in a while. You would need to have the car on to make it warmer. ,2
136459,When the air is cold outside your car is going to attract the heat faster just like if it was very hot outside your car gets very very hot like if you've ever been in the waterworld parking lot then your car and seat belts get really hot because the metal or leather whatever it is attracts whatever the radiation puts on it.,2
136485,"Because if it's cold and it's parked somewhere sunny it will basically be the same as the outside air . Why,because when there's cold and warm it will contain like the same as the outside air. Also because it's a cold day and his car is parked somewhere sunny doesn't change anything except one thing  .",2
136455,The air has been trapped in this car for a week in the sun making it warmer than weather temperature,2
136453,Since the day is cold the car had not heat to absorb keeping the same temperature as the outside.,2
136477,It will be warmer than the outside because it has been in the same spot for weeks.,2
136517,"I think it will be warmer because all the heat goes n, gets trapped by the glass and insulation, and just keeps gaining because the metal on the outside takes in heat, and the rubber and air on the tires keep it all in.",3
136496,The car is parked in the sun and closed so it will not leak heat.,3
136489,"I say it would be colder because of the cold air trapped inside of the car. The cool air doesn't escape, staying the same temperature. It will drop over time with the cool air staying.",2
136511,because there is already air inside of the car and the reflection of the sun to the car windows are heating up the air in the car.,2
136499,I say that it is colder than the outside because the color of the car would reflect the sun keeping the inside very cold.,2
136506,"Well, metal conducts heat because it is a conductor so it is reasonable that the car would be warmer than the air around it.",2
136497,The tempeture inside the car is warm becaus the warm air goes in and then it isetraped in. ,3
136508,I chose warmer than the outside air because the sun is going to the car and the air in the car can't go out so the air in the car will heat up and will make the car warmer.,3
141563,if you leave a car outside in the sun it will get hot and the sun points at the car window and reflects into the car and its been a week so its hot.,2
136501,"I think this because, although it is a cold day, all of the heat that has been in the car the whole week, will have been ""kept"" in the car, so it will be warmer than the outside air.",3
136493,I think that it would be like this because the car is parked in the sun and the sun would heat it up.,2
136512,If his car has been sitting in the sun for a week without being driven then it should be warmer just from sun rays even if the car is white.,3
136503,"The only thing heating up the car is the sun and there's two things that can make the car colder. One it hasn't been driven for a week, two its a cold day.",2
136498,"The temperature will be exactly the same as the outside air because The outside air is what comes into the car to make it hot or cold, so it would be the same temperature as the outside air. ",2
136520,because the heat from the sun is absorbed.,2
136494,The temperature inside the car would be warmer than the outside air because since it's been in the sun for a week the car would've absorbed all the heat and reflected the cold air.,2
136514,I chose colder than the outside air because because since it's cold outside and the car has been just sitting there for a whole week the car must be colder than the outside air because when an object is to be  put out in an area that is either hot or cold for a long time period the object inside is supposedly supposed to be colder or hotter in the inside.,2
136522,"I think that the inside of the car will be warmer than the outside air because it has been absorbing solar radiation from the sun, acting like a solar oven. ",4
136558,Because the interior can be black and absorb heat and the warm air can get trapped inside the car. ,3
136567,the car absorbs most of the heat and it depends on the color of the car.,2
136555,The heat came in through the window and the heat could not come out because the heat reflected from the window.,3
136571,Becasue when you park your car in the sun the car gets really hot.,2
136551,it is the same because it has been in the sun all week but once in the cold it gets cold,2
136566,Because the car is absorbing more heat.,2
136549,I think that the car is hotter than the outside air because we learned in the wise project that when sun light hits an item it absorbs the light and makes it hotter. ,3
136355,"I think that Akbar's  car will be hotter than the temperature outside because when my mom's car is out in the sun for a long time, it tends to be hotter inside. Also, depending on the car's color, it will absorb more heat.",2
136492,I think the air is cooler than outside because the person might be running the AC.  Also might be because the gas in the tank might be causing the car to be cooler.,2
136361,The air in the car is warmer because when air sits in a place where sun is beating on it the air gets warmer. For example when it was sunny out and I went to a carnival we left our car and as it sits the air got hotter so when we got in the air was hot.,2
136354,I think it is warmer than the outside because the solar radiation can come in and become heat but the heat can not leave so more heat will come in and then eventually it will be hotter because there is more heat. ,4
136387,The car has been sitting outside for a week so the overall temperature will be about the same.,2
136369,If it's been sitting in the sun for over a week it's most likely to absorb the radiation which would be converted to heat.,4
136351,I said that it would be warmer inside the car because when the sun hits the glass in the windows it creates a beam. That produces heat and that heat makes it warmer inside.,2
136421,The energy from the sun goes into the car and turns into heat. It then stays in the car and the car gets hotter.,5
136397,"I think that the air inside a car would be warmer than the air outside of a car. I think this because inside side the car the only way they heat can get out is if you roll down a window or open a door, but if you have all of the doors and windows shut in your car the heat can not come out.",2
136412,warmer beceause even if the car is white over a week it will most likely be warmer than the air outside.,2
136399,The car is going to get hotter inside then outside air because the heat is trapped in side the car.,3
136402,All of the heat will go into the car. All that heat that went in the car will stay in the car unless the window is open.,3
136396,                                                                                                                           I picked this answer because when its cold out side its gonna change the temp in the car.,2
136407,"The car is in the sun, but it's a cold day, so the temperature of the cold and hot will level out. However, this depends on the color of the car.",2
136406,Its been a cold week and sunny weak and it hasn't been driven for a week so the car would have the tempature as it did when he started the car a week ago.,2
136417,I think it will be exactly the same because it can get inside by the heat/ace vent and be the same as the outside air.,2
136410,because it is trapping the heat from the sun.,2
136409,The heat from the sun gets trapped inside the car which makes the car hotter than the outside.,2
136450,The car has been in the sun and has been absorbing more heat than it is escaping.,3
136451,Because it may be warm outside but after a week of the car being cold the car won`t heat up for a really long time. The car might be a little effected by the change of tempatures outside but it will still be cold inside the car by quite a bit,2
136468,Its going to be the same because every day the temperature changes because one day its cold and one day its hot so at night it starts cooling down. Then at 12:00pm the sun starts to hotter and hotter and eventually the car stars to get hot.,2
136480,"The reason why it might be cold because he has not been in the car for a whole week, and if it's a lighter color car, and the cold air is trapped inside of the car and it is outside.",2
136482,I think the air outside will be the same temperature inside of the car because of it would be warm outside because its a cold day but the sun is shinning. If the temperature inside of the car is cold and the sun is shinning on it that would also make it warm.  ,2
136457,"The air outside is cold, yet the sun is heating it up with solar radiation. On days like these, the car is just the same temperature. The car usually is the same temp of cold days; on hot days though the car is waaaay hotter inside and out.",3
136456,"It has had no heat inside of it what so ever in a week, causing the inside temperature to keep in the cold air it's had for a week. Also it maybe could be a little warmer depending on how the car absorbs and reflects heat.",2
136454,It is warmer than outside because it has not been used and all that heat that was in there has no way to get out. ,3
141561,I think it will be warmer because the car inside the heat will get trapped in from the sun when the sun hits the roof or sides of car it will get hotter because they could have black seats making it hotter.,3
136475,Akbar's car will be warmer than the outside air because they have not opened the car door in a week so all of the heat stays inside the car.,3
141559,the reason it will be hotter is because the car has glass leting sunlight inside the car and the longer the sunlight goes in the car the more and more the heat will increase ,3
136481," The car is like a greenhouse but it doesn't have all of the plants in it, the hot air transferred into the car and kept getting warmer and more hot air because of the sun.",3
136469,I think it will be warmer because it has been parked in the sun for a week with no activity it does not matter how the temputure was that day but what it wasduring the week.,2
136507,"The weather outside and over the week will have been focused on the car causing the heat of the sun to be trapped inside the car, especially since materials such as glass and metal will have enhanced the inside temperature. ",3
136502,I think so because I have experienced it in my dads car when the air outside is cold my dads caris colder because metal is a conductor.,2
136515,It would be warmer than outside because a car can trap heat inside if all the windows are up and if the car is a darker color like black it absorbs heat.  ,3
136553,because if it was in the sun then that means it will be hotter and if it's cold outside it might affect the car a little but if the car was in the sun for a week then it would take some time for the car to cool off.,2
136583,This happens because the car trapped the heat from the past week.,3
136546,"The car is made of materials that will take and trap heat, which makes the car hotter",2
136574,I think that it would be warmer on the inside than in the outside because when the solar rays hit the front of the car and when it wants to leave the glass makes it really hard to. besides since it has not been driven for a week when someone opened the door the heat would escape but since no one drove it than the heat can't escape. ,4
136570,I think that the temperature would be warmer than the outside because the sun shines in to the car and creates heat. Even thought the outside air is cold the car will still be warmer because when the sun's rays make the heat the heat gets trapped. ,5
136569,"I think the car would be exactly the same temperature because even though it's a cold day, the sun is out and if the interior of the car is darker, it might be even warmer.",2
136580,I think that the car would be warmer because the sun would still be radiating heat.,3
136564,"The outside air would be colder because even though it is a cold day, the heat and greenhouse gasses build up in the car and the windows of the car trap the heat in.",3
136559,"I chose warmer than the outside air because the glass heats up and it makes the whole car hotter, even if there wasn't a lot of sunlight .",3
136561,"Once the heat gets in it get trapped in there, building up greater temperature inside than outside.",3
136576,i think that the car would be warmer inside because in a car there aren't much places to get cold air in but if the windshield is wide open and the sun is hitting it and not much air is coming in then the sun will heat it up because once the hot air comes in then most of it stays in. and if it stays in then when more hot air comes in it will get hotter and hotter.  ,3
136556,I say warmer because it has been out during all those warm days and a single cold day will not immensely change that.,2
136560,Because when the sun shines on his car it traps some of the heat. ,3
139536,"The air inside the car would be heated air from the sun. Compared to the cold air outside of the car the air, the air inside would feel warmer due to being heated by the sun.",2
139541,"The car has been parked in the sun. which warms up the car. Air is an insulator so heat is slowly removed from the car, thus the temperature of the air inside of the car is warmer than that of the outside air.",2
139545,Warmer because heat gets trapped in the car meaning that temperature would increase.,3
139542,"The car is made of metal and glass. As the heat from the sun passes into the car, it is absorbed and stored. The concentrated sunlight starts heating up the car and it ends up warmer than the outside air. ",2
139540,"The car is warmer than the outside air, because the air could not go into a closed car.",2
139866,"The air or breeze can be a different temperature than the sun light hitting the car. I feel like if the car is getting direct sunlight, then it will be a different temperature than the outside air or breeze. When I read outside air, I am thinking about a breeze.",3
139544,"Based on my prediction, I think that the air inside the car would be warmer than the outside air even on a cold day because the sun rays shoots out not a lot but some heat that travels through the roof and/or windows that eventually gets trapped inside the car allowing the warm temperature to spread within the car.",4
139864,The car will reach equilibrium temperature with the outside air. ,2
139863,"When Akbar left his car out in the sun for a week, all the heat from sun shines into the car storing heat inside the car. ",2
139495,The car collects and traps the air inside by the greenhouse effect where the cold air can't escape.,3
139494,"The temperature of the air inside the car will be warmer than the outside air because if he parked in the sun and has not been driving for a week, then the heat inside the car when it is heated by the sun will stay inside even if it is a cold day.",3
139492,The material of the car traps heat from the sun.,2
139824,"I predict that the car will be the same temperature as the outside air because even though the car was parked in the sun for a week, the air outside can affect how hot or cold the car would be. Since the air is cold outside, the car's temperature will go down.",2
139482,"The air inside the car would be warmer than the outside air because the car is an enclosed environment so it cannot mix with the cold air outside and since the sun is giving off heat in the form of radiation, the car's outer walls absorb energy and windows allow radiation to heat up the seats in the car. All this is trapped, more or less, inside the car making the air hotter than the outside air",4
139493,"The heat from the outside of the car enters in through the windows and heats up the car. The heat however is unable to exit the car, causing the temperature of the inside of his car to be much hotter than the outside of the car.",3
139483,"The radiation of the sun should warm up the car (how when it's hot outside, the car is warm). Also, because the air inside the car is in a closed 'container' - not being exposed to the air outside of the air; the temperature of the car does not change (heat traveling from higher temperature to lower temperature). Thus, the air inside of the car will heat up due to the radiation of the sun. ",4
139834,"Glass is an insulator, but sunlight and radiation can be passed through them, causing the car to heat up. The heat does not escape as easy as it gets in.",4
139515,"The temperature of the air inside the car is not affected by the wind currents that happen outside the car. Convection occurs outside which reduces the temperature of air outside the car. However, the air inside the car is shut off from wind and left to absorb all the heat from the sun's radiation.",4
139831,"The sun heats up the car, thus heating the air inside the car up because the car is made of metal and metal easily conducts energy. ",3
139525,The car's walls will act like an insulator and trap the heat from the solar radiation in.,3
139514,"Although it is a cold day, the sun's energy shines into the car and the car traps most of its energy inside. Thus, it would be warmer inside the car than the outside.",4
139520,"Even though its a cold day and the car is parked in the sun, the temperature of the air inside the car is warmer than the outside air because there is no wind current inside the car while outside the car, there is convection occurring.",2
139518,"The inside of the car will be warmer because the car will trap the radiation entering the car.  Radiation can enter the car, but cannot escape, called greenhouse effect.  The sun's radiation will slowly warm the car up during an any temperature day.",4
139527,"The warmer because the sun would have provided sunlight, or heat,  to be trapped in the car.",3
139506,"This is because the air particles in the car have the temperature of the outside, and over time they tend to heat up each other, and pile up the heat to make a higher temperature.",2
139832,It is warmer than the outside air because the glass windows allow heat from the sun to get in and traps it inside the car. The cold air outside barely affects the inside of the car.,2
139833,Heat gets trapped inside the car and cannot escape so the inside of the car will be warmer than the outside air. ,3
139505,"Radiation from the sun will transfer heat energy from the sun to the car, as well as conduction of the heated metal of the car to the air will also heat up the insides of the car. However, heated air trapped in the car will not be able to escape the car through convection, so the air inside the car will be warmer than that of the outside.",4
139508,"The sun's rays are radiating on the car's surface, but the large volume of air creates an insulating effect, maintaining the temperature inside the car to be the same as the air outside. The heat from the sun is being spread apart by the air surrounding the car, so the rate of heat flow is extremely slow, meaning that the heat gain or loss will also be slow enough so that it is not noticeable since this also means that the radiation is not strong enough to penetrate the car's exterior. Like two objects of different temperatures, the car and the air will reach equilibrium eventually",3
139507,"Usually when it is cold but the car has been sitting under the sun for awhile, the car feels a lot warmer than the outside air and this is just based on personal experience.",2
139836,The Temperature of the air inside the car is warmer than the outside air because no outside air can penetrate through while the car is closed. Which traps the heat inside your car.,3
139526,The inside of the car will be warmer than the outside because even if it is a cold day there is still radiation of the sun that can heat up the car since it is made of metal.,3
139528,The car will hold the heat that it collects from the sun just like a green house would.,3
139521,"The car absorb heat that came from the sun through radiation through out the week. The cover of the car serve as a insulator that store the heat in the car. In a cold day, the cold through convection only affect the surface of the car, but not the air inside of the car.",3
139517,"Even though the day is cold, it is in the sun so the solar rays will go into his car and become heat inside the car.",3
139861,It is hotter because the space is limited and the hot air will keep circulating around the car while outside the air has the whole atmosphere to rise up and cool.,3
140326,Since it has been parked outside for a week in the sun the car has trapped heat so it will be warmer than the air outside. ,3
139543,This is because inside the car the air is trapped and has no where to go. Since it is cold outside the temperature would be the same because it should not be possible to heat itself up or cool itself down. ,2
139865,The air trapped inside the car would have been able to heat up due to amount of space that is limited so the air would be warmer than the outside.,2
139538,The cold air outside will gradually decrease the warm temperature that was inside the car eventually bringing it to equilibrium.,2
139533,I think the car might retain the heat and be hotter than the outside temperature. ,2
139539,Air is a good insulator so the heat of air will be warmer over a longer period of time.,2
139537,"Because the air inside the car will be heated up by the sun and since there is no fresh air coming in the car, convection will not occur and the car will be hot inside.",3
139862,"The heat that is inside the car is trapped inside, and most of it does not leave the car which would make the car warmer than the outside.",3
139535,"The heat that has accumulated from the sun will not be able to escape from the car that easily, so it will be hotter inside than it is outside.",2
139534,The air inside the car will be warmer than the outside air because the heat energy coming from the sun would be absorbed by the roof of the car and will be stored inside the car.,3
139487,"From past experiences, cars are different temperature from outside because it traps the temperature inside.",2
139826,The air in the car is warmer than the air outside because it has been contained in the same space for a longer period of time. The rays from the sun has been keeping the air inside warm even through the cold. The air is more contained and given heat through the sun's rays. ,4
139481,The temperature of the air inside the car is warmer than outside air because the sun rays coming from the sun is being trapped in the inside of Akbar's car.,3
139485,The radiation gets trapped in the car which causes the temperature of the car to be higher than the temperature outside.,3
139497,The temperature inside the car will feel warmer than the temperature outside the car because it has been in direct sunlight meaning it has been absorbing the heat from the sun directly which will make the car's temperature feel hotter than it does outside.,3
139479,"Based on experience, a car is hotter on the inside than it is outside on a hot day. The energy that enters the car from the glass will stay trapped in the car. The car should be warmer than the outside air.",4
139480,"The glass of the car produces a greenhouse effect, trapping the heat from the past days. So even though it is cold on that particular day, the heat that is trapped is still in the car. Thereby, making the interior of the car hotter than the environment that the car is in. ",3
139496,"When the car starts, the car will slowly warm up even without a heater. But the fact that the car hasn't been driven for over a week tells you that the car would be colder than the outside air. All the cold air seeped into the car because it hasn't been started for a long period of time. Especially when Akbar is walking to get his car on a very cold day, the temperature of the car inside would most likely be cold too.",2
139488,"The air inside the car would probably be more compact and not as exposed to the air outside the car, so it would be warmer.",2
139477,I believe that the inside of the car is warmer because it has trapped the heat from the sun inside without releasing that much of it when it got cold; so the air inside is warmer than the air outside.,2
139486,"The reason why the inside of the car gets much warmer than the outside is due to the idea of the green house effect. When the trapping of the sun's heat in a planet's,or in this situation the cars, atmosphere due to the high transparency of the atmosphere to visible radiation from the sun than to infrared radiation emitted from the planet's surface.",2
139830,"Over a period of time, all of the heat from the sun will hit the metal surrounding the car, causing the car to rise up in temperature on the inside of the car. ",2
139501,"The inside of the car would be warmer than the outside of the car because it has been parked outside for a while and since the car contains materials that conduct heat, it would take longer for it to cool down even if it is a cold day but eventually it would match the temperature of the outside. ",2
139829,It should feel cool since it is a cold day. Even if it is in the sun it does not affect much inside the car. In the morning the sun is out but the car is still cool because we have not driven it for hours and it takes a longer amount of time to heat up even if the sun is out. The sun is not shining bright enough to give the car that has been stationary for a week. The sun should have probably made it warm but the engine is not warm so the inside of the contained car is very cool.,2
139489,I think it is warmer than the outside air because the car probably acts as a greenhouse which traps heat energy emitted from the sun. ,4
139490,"Heat that has been reflected and refracted upon the car has been conserved in the car. Cars are made with metals so they tend to retain to heat a lot more. even if Akbar were to open it on a cold day, the inside would still be warmer than the outside. ",2
139491,"while Akbar park outside in the sun, the ray from the sun turn into heat as it hit the car, due to the car structure, the heat couldn't really escape, so its a continuous building of heat inside his car and the car would be much warmer than the outside air ",5
139478,"Since it is in a closed space with no openings or cracks, there is nowhere for the air inside to escape. So the warm air stays trapped inside the car and does not allow the car to cool down, instead it makes the car hotter. Even though the air around is cooler there radiation of the sun gives off heat inside the car",4
139827,the sun is hitting the car directly so the heat is trapped in the car it is not getting out because it is not ventilated ,3
139498,The heat that was transferred by radiation is trapped inside the car so therefore the air inside the car should be warmer that the air outside on a cold day. ,4
139499,Through personal experience I noticed on a cold day the care will most likely to cold inside due to air coming in through small vents.,2
139823,"The period of the car parked in the sun has been extensive. Extensive enough to have all the heat compounded into a enclosed space. Therefore, all the warmth has been collected making it warmer than the outside air.",2
139509,"I think air inside the car will feel warmer than the outside air because when I enter a car that has been  sitting outside for hours, the air inside feels warmer than the air outside.",2
139510,"Some of the heat from the sunlight is trapped inside the car, therefore it should be warmer since the outside is cold.",3
139513,The car is warmer because it traps the heat inside from solar radiation.,3
139523,"I think the air inside the car is cooler because, a car;s outside parts are made of metal which transfer heat at a high rate, therefore it will keep the inside of the car cool if the car is inside shade or a place that is cool but if it is hot outside and the car is outside, then the temperature inside the car would be hotter.",2
139524,"I think that the heat in the car can come in easily, but will take longer to escape.",2
139519,"The sunlight gets through the windows of the car, and also hits the surface of the car heating up the interior. Although not all the heat can escape the car, so the heat gets trapped inside heating up the car overtime.",4
139522,"If you leave something out in the sun by itself, it will heat it up. ",2
139516,The temperature in the car would not have changed that fast to the cold air outside if it has not been used and just parked there.,2
139511,"A car contains metal which are good conductors of heat. If you leave a car out in the sun for a very long time, the air inside the car will be unbearable to be in and will be much hotter than the outside temperature because there is no room for the air to escape so the air molecules will keep bouncing around inside the car. Same for cold temperature on the outside. The car will feel much more colder inside than the outside if it is snowing or something like that. ",2
139536,"The materials the car is made out of, will allow radiation to go into the car and turn into heat. The heat that is inside the car will not be able to be released due to the cars materials be insulators.",5
139541,"The material of the car consists of insulators so when radiation from the sun enters the car, it will stay in the car. It takes a long period of time for the heat to release.",4
139497,I believe that the car is warmer than the outside air because it has been sitting directly in the sun so the air inside of the car should be warmer than the outside air.,2
139487,The car is sitting in the sun so the heat from the sun will be transferred into the car and trapped inside.,2
139826,"The solar radiation being emitted by the sun has been been converted to heat energy in the car. That heat energy has been in the car for a long time, it has been retained. The air inside the car is warmer than the air outside the car.",5
139493,"The heat is trapped within the car, and the heat is unable to escape the car, causing the interior of the car to be warmer than the outside of the car.",3
139513,Temperature is warmer on the inside because heat is trapped inside.,3
139834,The glass traps the heat from prior to the cold weather.,3
139831,The temperature is warming inside the car than the outside of the car because the heat is trapped inside. ,3
139516,It is going to be warmer the air outside the car because the air inside the car is warm and it gets trapped inside the car.,3
139836,Because air is trapped inside his/her car which would mean the molecules are not able to escape which heats up his car. also no outside air can penetrate inside the car.,3
139545,"The radiation is sent into the car , but the windows keep the heat from escaping, which in return traps heat and increases temperature.",4
139538,"Since there are many glass panes on the car, it will help keep the heat inside; glass is a good insulator. Also, not many openings are there so the heat will stay inside for a while as well.",3
139533,The car is made of metal and glass and absorbs the heat from the sky and keeps the inside of the car warmer than the outside air. ,3
140326,Since the car has been parked in the sun for a while it has trapped heat causing it to be warmer than the outside. ,3
139543,This is because since the car has its own atmosphere due to its materials and locked circulation if its cold outside the cold would be trapped inside the car.,2
139534,"The air is warmer because the air inside the car is in an enclosed area, and so the heat has nowhere to escape or only less heat is escaping.",3
139861,The car is enclosing the air already in there so it is protected and sealed from the cold wind. So the warm air just keeps on circulating in the enclosed space of the car. Also all the glass windows allows the light to come in and heat it up.,4
139544,The inside of the car would be warmer than the outside air because the warm air released from the sun gets trapped inside the car and stays circulating around the car.,3
139864,the car is an insulator so it keeps heat trapped in the car,3
139542,The car's windows would trap heat from the sun and keep it inside. Even if it's cold outside a car is mostly insulated so it would be warmer inside that outside. ,2
139479,The car acts as a greenhouse. Solar radiation enters the car through the windows and the material inside the car will turn that into heat. Infrared radiation released from the material inside the car will stay in the car because it cannot leave through the windows.,5
139477,"The temperature of the inside of Akbar's car is warmer because the heat has been trapped inside from it being parked in the sun. Radiation enters the car, but it gets trapped like the greenhouse effect and heat stays in. Also with the dark car, it absorbs light even more.",4
139501,,1
139485,,1
139515,The air inside the car is warmer than the outside air because the outside air is affected by convection currents which cools it. ,2
139514,The sun's infrared energy is trapped by the car's windows.,4
139509,There are heat trapped in the car because the glass traps the heat in the car.,3
139507,"Even though it is cold outside, the light from the sun travels through the windows and the windshield and that converts into heat. Since the windows and doors and probably closed, much of the heat is retained, keeping the inside of the car warmer than the outside air.",4
139510,The heat is trapped inside the car from sitting in the sunlight.,3
139835,The air inside of the car will be warmer than the air outside because it is trapped inside with causes convection and conduction to occur.,3
139517,"The heat from the sun is retained inside the car and is not let out for a week, making the car warm inside.",2
139521,"The car has glass that is similar to the atmosphere. The solar radiation is able to go through the glass and stored as heat in the car, and the infrared radiation is reflect back to the car and covert back to heat. This allow the car to store heat inside, and have a warmer temperature than the outside air.",5
139526,The temperature inside the car will be warmer than the temperature outside because the inside of the car is like an insulator and the there is sunlight being directed at the car. The solar radiation will turn into heat as it enters through the glass windshield,4
139511,"Because the car is made out of metal and being exposed to the cold outside air, which cause the car to be cold, and so is the inside of the car. ",2
139506,"Since the car is in the sun all the heat gets absorbed into the car, and heat gets trapped so it allows it to be a really high temperature.",3
139863,The cars windows would trap heat inside the car thus keeping the temperature inside the car warmer than the temperature on the outside. ,3
139540,"The air inside a car is warmer than the outside air, because its in a closed environment, when it absorbs heat from the outside, the air would trap in the car. It would not escape anywhere.",3
139866,"The infrared radiation that has entered the car will be harder to escape. Once the infrared radiation is in the car, it will take a while to release.",3
139539,It is warmer inside a car than the outside air because heat is being trapped in the inside the car but infrared light is not let out. Hot air and Cold air is trapped inside in a process called convection. cold air is going down and hot air is rising.,4
139823,"Overtime, the car traps the heat absorbed from the Sun, therefore increasing the heat inside.",3
139535,"The space in the car will be warmer because the radiation will convert into heat and be detained in the car, collecting heat until the air inside is warmer than the air outside.",5
139862,"The heat is trapped inside of the vehicle and the sun is going into the car, while the heat does not escape the vehicle easily, this increases the heat of inside the car.",3
139537,"Because inside the car, the air is trapped and cool air does not go inside the car. The mirrors of the car is like the object that heats up the air because the Infrared Radiation that bouncing back from the surface inside of the car gets reflected back to the interior of the car again causing more heat to be transferred to the air. ",4
139832,"Since the car has been in the sun for a longer period of time, the heat will be trapped in and will take longer to adjust to the outside temperature.",3
139523,The car would be warmer than the outside air because the car is parked outside in the sun where the solar radiation will hit the car through the glass windows and changing into heat and can not escape because the glass reflects the heat energy back. In addition the air inside the car is a good insulator where it does not lose the heat at a fast rate.,5
139833,"The radiation from the sun will be trapped inside the car so even if it's a cold day, the inside of the car will still be warm. ",4
139519,"The car is warmer because the car is under direct sunlight, so the car is receiving solar radiation that passes through its windows. Since the windows are glass, it provides great insulation so that the solar radiation that has been converted into heat can not escape. So overtime, the car will slowly heat up.",5
139505,"Since the car has not been driven for a week and has been sitting in cold temperature for a long period of time, the car will reach equilibrium with the cold air.",2
139483,"The temperature will be the same because hot air that was trapped inside the car will eventually travel to the outside air because hot/warm air travels to the cooler temperatures. Thus, the hot air in the car will eventually reach equilibrium. ",2
139496,The inside of the car would be colder because it is a cold day. The cold air is seeping into the car and the coldness is being trapped inside. ,2
139489,If a car is hotter than it is on the outside on a hot day then it must be warmer than the outside air on a cold day because the car acts as a greenhouse and is able to trap heat.,3
139494,It is colder because the environment inside the car keeps in the temperature and stores the coldness inside the car while the outside temperature slowly changes.,2
139518,The temperature of the air inside the car will be warmer than outside air because the windows allow heat Energy to enter the car but doesn't allow in the heat to escape.,4
139525,The temperature of the inside the car will be warmer than the outside air because the car's materials serve as an insulator for the heat inside the air inside the car.,2
139520,The temperature of the air inside the car is warmer than the outside air because there is no convection occurring but radiation transfers heat into the car and is trapped inside the car.,4
139527,The window allows heat energy to enter the car and doesn't allow it to escape.,4
139508,"The infrared radiation from the sun enters the interior of the car through the windows of the car and the thickness of shell of the car and its windows helps trap the infrared radiation inside the car. The thickness of the shell and windows also restricts cold air from entering the inside of the car, so equilibrium will not be reached.",4
139524,The greenhouse effect will cause the car to be warmer than the outside. ,2
139528,,1
139522,It is warmer than the outside air because the car just sits there and heat is being absorbed and trap into the car.,3
139824,The car has different materials so the cold air outside will be trapped into the car.,2
139482,The windows allow the sunlight to get in the car while it traps heat in the car. The air is an isolated from the outside so the air inside would be warmer than the surrounding ,4
139480,The energy from solar radiation has been trapped in the car from the days where it has been sunny and has not escaped the car. So the car will be warmer than the outside air. ,4
139828,It is colder because the environment inside the car retains the temperature and stores the coldness inside the car while the outside temperature changes slowly.,2
139492,The glass from the windows of the car traps heat inside the car which makes it warmer than the outside air.,3
139829,It was left in the sun for awhile and the material the car is made up should have increased the temperature. ,2
139481,As his car is parked in the sun radiation is traveling inside through the car creating heat energy and is being trapped in there and is increasing for how ever long Akbar has left it there.,4
139827,the sun is reflectiing into the car and the heat is not escaping ,3
139800,"The temperature of the air inside the car is is warmer because solar radiation given from the sun was converted to heat energy, it has been in the car for such a long time that it has been kept there.",4
139488,"It should be warmer inside the car because like the solar oven, the car should retain some of the the heat that enters the car.",3
139495,The car is an insulator where the convection inside the car keeps the car cool.,2
139785,"The air trapped in the car does not escape and reach equilibrium with the air outside, but instead it is warmer than the air outside because the heat is trapped in the car.",2
139769,Since the car has been outside for a week the temperature transfer would have reached and equilibrium.,2
139819,"It would normally be colder than the outside air, but since its out in the sun, it'll cancel the coldness out. ",2
139796,,1
139803,,1
139643,The inside of the car will be warmer because the energy from the sun will become trapped inside the car due to the glass windows. ,4
139802,Metal is a good conductor so inside the car it would be warm but it will release quicker.,2
139842,Because inside of the car have different material like a car seat and radio and etc,2
139845,The air from outside is slowly transferring heat into the car.,2
139846,"The temperature of the air inside the car will be colder than the air outside because most of the heat is being transferred to the body of the car. In addition, the sun is hitting the outside of the car, creating a thin barrier between the inside of the car and the outside.",2
139561,Because the radiation from the sun can keep the car warm.,3
139798,It is warmer inside the car than outside because the heat has been inside the car for a long time.,2
139870,"Because the enclosed space inside a car is way smaller than the free world and with less space,it is easy to change the temperature.",2
139838,The air inside the car would be warmer because the sun is directly pointing at the car making the car warmer on the inside compared to the weather outside.,2
140093,because all that air that has been trapped in the car has not been exposed to the cold air so when you open your car it should feel warmer because it's been in the sun and not messed with for awhile,3
139840,"Because it has just been sitting there. Just because the sun out it won't make it warmer. SO lets say the windows frost up, so when the windows frost up that causes the cold air to get through and make it the same temperature as outside.",2
139875,It will be the same temperature as outside because even though it hasn't been moved for a week if he is getting in the car on a COLD day it should be the same because heat is going to be released faster since it wasn't under the sun anymore. ,2
139806,"I think the temperature of the air inside the car is warmer than the outside, because the car is a closed space, and the car windows is a good insulator, which can trap the heat inside the car.",3
139856,Colder because it has not been used for a week. A car usually needs to be warmed up when started.,2
139841,Air is a good insulator which means the sun would cause it to heat up and it would stay hot even though the weather is cold,2
139822,Air has been compacted and radiation may occur due to the sun.,3
139737,Colder because all the cold outside the car went inside the car and it trapped.,2
139853,The temperature inside is hotter because the sun heat is trapped inside the car and there is not windows for the heat to go so heat keeps getting in and increasing temp.,2
139775,The warm sun rays get trapped in the car which causes it to be warmer than the outside air. ,3
139851,,1
139847,,1
139747,Akbar's car acts as an insulator which contains cold and heat inside the car got absorb by the cold air from the outside of the car.,2
139843,,1
139739,"The weather of being inside of a car is warmer because of the radiation that goes on inside, which heats up the car itself and makes the heat warmer.",3
139848,,1
139849,,1
139879,Because it was parked in the sun the ray's of the sun were able to heat the inside of the car using radiation.,3
139876,"The temperature of the air inside the car is exactly the same than the outside air because the cold air will outside is absorbed by the car, therefore the coldness stays inside.",2
139877,The radiations from the sun gets trapped in the car making the air in the car to feel warmer than outside.,4
139881,,1
139869,"Since the car has been sitting outside for a week without driving it, it'd feel warmer than the outside.",2
139874,The car will trap in the heat so it would be warmer then the outside.,3
139867,"The heat would be trapped inside that's coming from the sun, just like the atmosphere traps heat to the earth.",3
139873,The heat has been trapped inside like how the atmosphere traps heat to the earth,3
139839,Its cold outside so if you enter the car it would be warmer. ,2
139882,,1
139768,the heat builds up inside the car very quickly with how closed and dark car interiors are,2
139880,,1
139878,,1
139854,,1
139809,The sunlight goes in the car and heats up through radiation,3
139814,I think the air inside the car will be warmer than the outside air because the car has been parked in the sun receiving some heat.,2
139795,,1
139816,,1
139812,"The car will absorb the heat from the objects thats inside of the car already, so it holds its own heat... ",2
139782,It would be much warmer than the outside air because if you leave a car outside and the sun is pointing towards it the car would absorb the heat. ,2
140712,I feel that it would be warmer because the car was sitting for a while week that there was probably still be trapped in the car. ,2
139529,i think it will be warmer because it was being park in the sun,2
139801,"The sun uses its radiation to hit the car, this then allows conduction to heat up the car inside, and finally convection spreads throughout the car making it hot.",3
139774,If you haven't driven for a week and its been in the sun for a whole week of course the inside will be hot. Cause all the heat of the sun makes everything inside burn you or will make your food poison if u left any food in that whole week.,2
139790,"the sun is still giving heat, but maybe the cold is coming from the breeze and the breeze does not go inside the car so then the car is still warmer than the outside air.",2
139855,"The temperature will be exactly the same as the outside air because they are at the same temperature, there are no more heat transfers",2
139778,,1
139808,,1
139797,,1
139815,"Because the glass and body of the car, insulates some heat. ",2
139817,the car has been left in sun for a week untouched so the air inside the car will be hotter than the cold air that is out side his car.,2
139787,it would be the same cause cold would remove the heat from the car,2
139799,It's warmer than the outside air because the hot air from outside got trapped inside of the car.,3
139785,"The car is completely closed for a week and because of that, heat from the sun is completely trapped in the car. Equilibrium can not be achieved because of the fact that convection did not occur since the car is completely shut and the heat from the outside is not able to change the heat in the inside.",2
139845,"when the door is close, oxygen can't get in, so it will make the temperature warmer.",2
140093,It should be warmer because it's been sitting in the sun for awhile and all of the suns energy that has been hitting the car is stuck inside of the car. Also because the car hasn't been moving or anything so the air conditioning or anything has been turned on in order to make it cooler than the outside air.,3
139808,The car will be warmer than the air outside because the is pretty much made from plastic and because its plastic it will transfer heat slower than metal will. ,2
139816,"Most cars are metal, the cold air coming in contact with the car's temperature meets equilibrium with the temperature outside. Eventually the temp of the car will effect the temp inside, with the help of the glass windows and sealed doors, the cold air doesn't leave the car.",2
139819,"Even if it was sitting outside the sun for a long period of time, it was sitting out on a cold day, meaning that it would be cold despite absorbing all that heat",2
139782,I think that it would be the same because the temperature would even out with the outside and inside of the car.,2
139787,the same cause the temp will even out over time,2
139769,The heat going into the car will stay and not leave as fast as it would through air.,3
139809,Light enters the car and is absorbed as heat in the cars inner surfaces,3
139556,The heat cannot escape from the car so the heat stays inside and stays warm.,3
139812,the heat cannot escape from the car so the heat stays inside and stays warm.,3
139529,it will be warmer cause it was parking in the sun,2
139815,"The car retains some heat, since it is enclosed.",3
139817,the heat for the past week been hitting his car so the air that is inside is warm and the air outside is cold,2
139806,"Because the sunlight passes through the glass and turn to heat, and also glass is a good insulator, which can trap the heat inside the car.",5
139561,"The heat is trapped inside the car since car is made of metal, it's going to absorb heat and gets trapped.",3
139841,Because the inside of the car would trap the sunlight in and warm up the inside.,4
139775,"Because the air outside is colder than the heat emitted into the car, the car is colder than the outside air. ",2
139844,The sun will heat up the inside of the car and the temperature will be warmer because the car windows are trapping the heat inside.,3
139856,"The temperature of the air inside the car would be warmer than the outside air because the car is parked in the sun; therefore, the car is absorbing the sun's heat.",2
139840,It will be the same because it has been sitting there and as the it sits there inside his car will be the same temperature.,2
139875,The heat isn't going to be sealed in the car once you get in so after the cold day all the heat is going to be gone even if it sat under the sun for a whole week.Heat is released and not kept.,2
139839,The temp inside the car will be warmer than the outside air because of the greenhouse effect. Since the glass of the car is transparent more energy is absorbed from the sun causing it to be warmer. ,4
139768,"cars are usually dark inside and could have the heater be lingering from it being last used, and that it absorbs the sunlight it can get",3
139855,"The temperature of the air inside the car will be exactly the same as the outside air because our body doesn't feel temperature, we feel it when heat enters or leaves the body.",2
139778,The car is placed outdoors causing the heat of the car and the air to mix causing the temperature to be the same.,2
139811,I predict the temperature to be warmer than the outside air because the heat will be trapped inside of the car. ,3
139801,Convection will heat up the car from conduction and the conduction is caused by radiation.,3
139803,"Even if its a cold day, there is still sun shining on the car which heat can go in and because the car has no opening the heat will also be trapped inside which will cause the temperature of the air insdie the car to be warmer than the outside air.",3
139813,It would be warmer because of the heat trapped inside of the car. ,3
139790,The sun radiated to the inside of the car and the car kept the heat.,4
139797,The temperature inside the car will be warmer than the air outside of the car because the air is being trapped inside the car therefore it will just increase in heat accordingly towards the temperature outside of the car. ,3
139814,The temperature of the air inside the car is warmer than the outside air because car has been outside in the sun receiving heat.,2
139810,,1
139795,The temperature of the air inside the car is warmer because the air from the outside can't really go inside the car because the windows are closed or it depends if the windows are open or not.,2
139796,The heat inside the car has no way out.,3
139798,"Since the heat was trapped inside the car, it will feel hotter inside than the air outside.",3
139842,Because of the glass of the car will increase the heat whenever it goes thru the glass. ,2
139818,The inside would be warmer because sunlight would be trapped inside which would heat up the inside.,4
139643,"The solar radiation from the sun enters the car and becomes heat which is trapped by the glass, thus the inside will be warmer.",5
139850,it would be colder because it would be colder outside to start with and nobody has entered in the car aswell making it cold as days pass,2
139802,Its been sitting in the sun for a week and so the car will absorb the heat and trap it in the car.,3
139843,Equilibrium makes both inside of the car and outside the same temperature even though one feels colder than the other.,2
139849,the car is a smaller area that conducts more heat,2
139870,the temperature will be hotter because it is a smaller space and all of the heat inside gets trapped in it.,3
139881,warmer because it had been parked in the sun and the cold temperature is not going inside the car.,2
139876,The air inside the car is warmer than the air outside of the car because the heat is being absorbed by the car. ,2
139878,it's warmer because the air has been stuck inside the car.,3
139838,The car has a smaller space which makes it easier to trap in heat especially if the sun is directed at the parked car.,3
139880,I think that is going to be warmer than the outside air because the car was parked in the sun for a week so the air got hot inside the car.,3
139871,"The heat from the sun, it contract the heat to inside the car.",2
139882,The car had been parked in the sun for a week which means the doors or windows weren't open for the car to cool off.,2
139869,"I think it'd be warmer than the outside, because the car is a closed space which leaves the temperature to scatter.",2
139847,Presumably with the windows closed the energy is being retained within the car because its a closed system their isn't any opening for heat to escape from the car.,4
139879,,1
139853,It's warmer because it attracts heat so heat will be trapped inside. ,2
139747,I think it would be the same because it has been a week already and it must have reached equilibrium temp. already.,2
139774,It will feel exactly the same as the outside air because our body does not feel the temperature. ,2
