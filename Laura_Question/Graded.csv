,nan,0
150206.0,well the light colors reflects the sun and that may help for her,3
150243.0,i chose light colored because black colored heats up things,2
118603.0,cause the less sun light there is the car won t be as hot,3
153978.0,scientists have proven that dark colors such as black attract heat therefore a light colored car and a light colored fabric are a better option if you don t want your car to get hot,2
150908.0,a dark color like black attract more sumlight,3
153992.0,cause it s light so it s not going to be as hot,2
119017.0,light colors doesn t attracted heat,2
118306.0,dark colors attract the lite but light colors do not attract sun light that is why i chose to use light colors,3
118558.0,it should be a light covered fabric because it doesn t attract the sun like the black fabric does,2
150144.0,black attracts heat so if she doesn t want her car to heat up she can use light colors and light fabrics,2
150074.0,this will keep the light from coming through the windows were it is most likely to stop heat from being trapped in the car,2
139803.0,in order to keep the car cool you will need to use light colors so that no heat will be trapped into it because dark colors will attract heat which will cause it to stay even warmer longer,2
150203.0,if you use a dark color it will atrack heat but when you have a light fabric it does not atrack heat,3
118555.0,it will be using dark colerd fabric on the inside of the car,2
,nan,1
118360.0,if it is dark the dark brown and black will atract heat and make it hotter,2
154131.0,since dark colors attract heat light colored fabrics don t so if she wanted to keep her car cool she should use light colored fabrics,2
118309.0,probraly it would cover son,2
154148.0,because since its less thick it is cooler,2
118407.0,dark things attract heat and light things don t attract that much heat,2
154220.0,i dont know,1
153843.0,because the dark colors attract the heat so the light colors won t,2
154152.0,i chose dark cooler because the light one because the light is like the sun,2
118599.0,it is better because if you have dark color like black it will be more hot inside and if you have light colors it wont heat that much,2
154312.0,the color black atracs the sun,2
150128.0,since light colors reflect heat it would be important to have light colored elements in the car,3
153993.0,i know that because my moms old car had dark fabric and when the car was outside it got really hot so laura should use light colored fabric,2
155053.0,her car has to be light because dark colors attract sunlight and she wants to keep her car cool,3
136367.0,i choose a and c because black absorbs heat and white dose not,2
153918.0,since black absorbs heat i would think its beter,3
150073.0,dark colors attract heat,2
141563.0,if she puts light colored frabric inside then the light wont get the sun alot if she puts it inside then it wont be hot it will be room temp,2
118526.0,i picked these answers because the sun likes darker colors not lighter colors so if she dose lighter colors the it won t be as hot in the car,2
118478.0,darker paint heats up the car faster,2
118621.0,,1
118343.0,she should use a fabric because the paint of the car doesn t matter and if you use fabric for example the steering wheel will not get hot,2
153978.0,scientists have shown that dark colors like black will attract heat therefor a light colored car is the best option,2
139840.0,darker colors absorbs more heat faster,3
154111.0,i choose the light inside and outside because dark attracts heat not light colors,2
136417.0,i said that because when there is light colors there is less heat to be hot,2
118358.0,because the sun only puts to much heat on dark things not light things,2
118610.0,the lighter the color the less light it gets,3
151179.0,it better to use light colors because dark colors will attract more light,3
153863.0,it wont attract the sun much,2
149965.0,i know that if anything is dark it creates more heat in the car,2
153854.0,if you use dark fabric on the inside the sun will immediately see the dark fabric and that will cause to heat up the car so if you use light colored fabric the car will not get as hot,2
153996.0,use dark colored fabric because dark colors keep the sun away,2
139879.0,nan,1
154154.0,light colored paint is better because you don t get to suffer in the hot sun because if you use dark colored paint it will be hot inside the car and you won t be able to handle the hot sun your gonna feel like getting out of the car,2
154143.0,i think this because of te light color is not heavy niether the sun can make it hot in the hot,2
136366.0,because using white or light colors wont attrack the suns heat as much and keep the car cool,2
136468.0,if the car has dark fabric and dark paint on the outside it might be cooler but if she gets light colored paint and fabric the car will get cooler,2
141559.0,well i think it should be dark inside and light inside because if light colors reflect heat most of it will deflect and if some heat does come in then the black can oxorb it and not deflect it all throu the car,4
150154.0,if you use light colored paint doesn t attract heat,2
154331.0,i think that she should keep the light color outside because if it was the dark color it would get really hot and if it was light color it would not get that hot in the car so that is the solution,2
150176.0,the lighter the color of choice is the less heat it will attract,2
150078.0,dark attracts the sun,2
139845.0,light color absorbs heat slower than dark color,3
118595.0,the sun will not come in the car when she leaves because the sun atracks more with dark colors then bright colors,2
150910.0,because the light will be colored,2
154156.0,because if the dark colored was outside the sun won t hit to much the sun heat,2
118556.0,getting the light color things will help not getting the car so hot because the dark colored things attract the heat and the light colored thing do not,2
150052.0,i chose that because any other color will make it hotter then it is,2
118314.0,becoue with a dark coler paint it wont get to haot,2
139508.0,the sun s rays provide heat energy through radiation using the same principles as light since these are electromagnetic waves we know that the light will be able to penetrate through the car especially on the windows because they are made of glass and are transparent allowing the light to go through light colors reflect light whereas dark colors absorb light meaning that the light colors are reflecting heat energy from the electromagnetic waves and the dark colors are absorbing them making the interior hotter through conduction the light colors in the inside of the car will help keep the car cool because it provides another layer of protection in a way where the fabric can help reflect the light that is able to penetrate through the car s exterior,5
150164.0,dark colors absorb heat which is an example of conduction,3
154132.0,black contracts heat faster so if its white it will not get as hot,2
153926.0,black attracts the sun and if you paint your car black the heat wont go inside the car sp if there is black fabric it will attract the heat into the inside of the car,2
151208.0,i chose light colored fabric because it will reflect out of the car,3
154160.0,because dark colored paint makes something hotter,2
118542.0,i think iou use light colored paint and fabric inside the car then it won t attrack to much heat because black color,2
151227.0,i think its using dark colored fabric because the sun cant get trought fabric,2
150909.0,you would not want to do dark colors because darkness attracts the sun and light colors dont,2
136502.0,because since a light colored paint will reflet the heat it will keep her car cool,3
150166.0,i think this is true bacause light colors will allow heat in the car but dark colors wont,2
118581.0,dark colors attracts the sun and light colors don t so the car won t get hot with light colors,2
153843.0,dark atracts more sun light because dark atracts more sun light,3
136560.0,because the light paint and the light colored fabric will keep her car cool because it reflesct sunligt,4
153982.0,for example black is a dark color and dark colors collect more heat so i think you should light colored fabric on the inside of the car,2
150105.0,laura should use light colors because dark colors attract heat,2
118509.0,the sun is attracted to dark colors and you are trying to keep the inside cool so you would use light colors so the sun won t be attracted to it,2
118558.0,it should be a light covered because a black colored fabric attracts the sun and a light covered fabric doesn t same with the paint,2
154200.0,well using a light color will help the car maintain cool because light colors woun t atract the sun as much as dark colors,2
154112.0,dark colors are more attractive to heat because last summer i had a black shirt and got really hot and my friend work a pink shirt and she didn t get as hot,2
150133.0,if you use light color fabric on the inside it will get less hot because dark colors attract sun light,3
139882.0,dark colored cars receives feels much hotter than light colored cars,2
118438.0,we all know that dark colors attract sun heat so the car has to be a light color if laura were to paint her car a light color it would not work because the material of the car will always attract the sun if you put a light colored fabric over the car it will not make the car hot,2
139485.0,nan,1
153936.0,using a light color,2
139737.0,light color really does not absorbs the heat not like black it will always feel hot,3
139866.0,darker colors will absorb heat more which means having a lighter color will absorb heat less,3
118337.0,i picked my answer because i know that dark colors attract and light colors repel,2
139538.0,since black colored objects absorb heat better the lighter colored objects would help decrease the amount of heat being absorbed allowing the car to become less hotter,3
118479.0,when the sun hits its the sun won t go inside the car,2
136498.0,if you use light colors for the inside and outside of the car it will make the car cool instead of using dark colors to make the car hot,2
154315.0,i would want theose to be both light because dark colors attrack heat,2
139796.0,darker colors absorb more heat than lighter colors,3
136396.0,i picked this answer because if its hot outside and the car paint is black the light colored seats stay cool and don t heat up,2
118624.0,first i chose using light colored paint on the outside because dark colors can heat things up colors like black increase an object s temperature when it is is under the sun second i chose using light colored fabric on the inside because the darker the color the more the temperature will increase,2
118612.0,the sun is atracted to the dark colors and not the light colors,2
118583.0,so it does not etract the heat,2
136519.0,i picked this because of albedo and dark colors attract more sun,2
136520.0,nan,1
118571.0,the dark colored paint will keep it cool,2
118600.0,it will not take in any heat,2
118611.0,nan,1
150086.0,white is a cool color,2
149950.0,the light colors are important because the reflect heat,3
151200.0,i chose those answers because dark color atrack heat and light colors don t,2
154326.0,light color does not attract heat and the dark colors do,2
118584.0,,1
150205.0,i said using light colored fabric inside because the leather cause the heat get more hotter inside,2
118587.0,you should use a light colored car because dark color has more heat,2
150168.0,why i chose the second answer and the light colored color and fabric is because with light colored color and fabric the sun will reflect and not heat up the car,3

149962.0,dark color on the out side can block some of the heat,2
118297.0,dark colors attract sun so you need light colors,2
118517.0,because the darker the color is then the more hot it will be so light colors would attract the sun less,2
149970.0,dark colors attract heat,2
150172.0,i chose light colors cause dark colors absorb heat,3
150162.0,you have to use light colors because then the car wont heat up as much if it where to be a car with a light color paint dark fabric or dark paint w light fabric,2
154197.0,the color black absorbs more heat,3
118482.0,i think she should put a dark colored fabric on the inside so the light wont get in the inside of the car,2
150062.0,i think that she should use dark colored paint on the outside because if u use light colored paint it will make her car hot,2
150070.0,because dark colors attract heat more than lighter colors so that is why she should use lighter colors inside and outside of the car,3

153936.0,using light color,2
150145.0,it will not let light get in the car because its dark,2
150121.0,why is that the car yes needs a different color but i don t think that s the main reason why it s so hot beacuse when my dad s car sits in the sun its bright color green but when we get in it it s really hot beacuse the seats are dark brown so it would contrap more heat from outside to inside,3
136373.0,i chose something light because dark colors can cause warm and if you use a light color it wont cause a lot of heat so laura s car wont warm up as much as she wants it to,2
150082.0,if the color of the paint should be light because if the color was dark then that means that it will attract the sun you want light colored seats so they don t fade and it won t attract heat,3
154204.0,the dark is better because it keeps the un out,2
139817.0,lighter colors keep it fresh while darker colors makes it more hot,2

139862.0,dark colors retain heat more well than lighter colors,3
118570.0,i think that the inside of the car the fabric and the outside of the car should be light colored because it doesn t atracts as much sun the dark colors,2
136390.0,i had chosen the third one to use light colored fabric and light colored paint because when you use light colored fabric it cools down the car and makes it cooler inside so you will be cooler when you use light colored paint on the outside of your car it wouldn t stay hot on the outside of the car,2
151193.0,because you would get that reflected to other object,2
136509.0,light colors don t asorb that much heat but dark colors asorb a lot of heat so that is why laura could use light colors to cool her cars down,3
154142.0,light colors are better because dark colored fabric have heat,2
118581.0,if it s dark then it will attract the sun,2
154114.0,i think this because dark colors heat up faster but light colors don t as fast,2
118303.0,i think that the light colored fabric because the color makes it cool in side of the car,2
118451.0,so the heat wont absorbe,2
118300.0,because you don t want the sun heating your car so put on light colored fabric,2
154122.0,caue the heat from the sun is being blocked,2
154150.0,i would use a dark colored paint because the darker the color it wouldn t go threw the shield,2
136467.0,a light colored paint would reflect the sunlight so it would keep the car cooler,4
150905.0,light colors attract a lot less heat than dark colors do,2
150086.0,it keeps shade in from getting hot,2
118551.0,i think that you should use light colors because the sun won t blend with the light colors,2

150214.0,a lighter color will not attracted the sun,2
154026.0,you want to use lighter colors because dark colors attract the heat if you have lighter colors then the heat bounces off the light colors,3
139782.0,light color paint because darker colors attract more of the heat and light colors is less,2
151210.0,nose,1
136413.0,the light colored fabric would reflect the heat out of the car so the heat that got inside would leave if it was on the outside it could not do that,3
149971.0,the car does not want to get hot,2
154329.0,light colored because the fabric tends to heat up more when the color gets darker,2
118455.0,,1
118524.0,having light coloured paint and light fabric on the interior will keep laura s car cool rather than having dark colours because dark colours attract heat,2
118361.0,i think you should use fabric because it stop sun light to come in the car so the car is not to hot,3
118552.0,i don t know,1
118569.0,usind a light colored fabric dosn t attract the sun as much as black and other dark colors,2
153905.0,dark colors attract heat if it is a light color than it will be cooler,2
119017.0,sun heat is attracted to dark colors,2
150247.0,because dark colors atract light,3
151193.0,i dont know,1
150140.0,it ll be easier to use light colored fabric so it won t let the inside of the car get too hot,2
150052.0,i picked that one because if you use dark fabric it will just get hotter,2
150127.0,i think if it is a darker color the sun will attract to it more rather then if she has a lighter colored car,3
150177.0,white is better because black extracts heat and since there is black on the outside and black on the inside it is going to get twice as hot,2
150133.0,i chose using light colored fabric on the inside of the car because if you use dark colored fabric it will heat up more and the the heat would heat up the air if you use light colored fabric on the inside of the car it will conduct less heat,3
154119.0,you use a dark color on the outside because the heat will be blocked out by the dark color the light color will help the car be cool,2
151162.0,dark is like a cold chill so it will be chilly,2
118537.0,i think that laura should use a dark color outside her car so when the sun s heat hits the car it will be able to reflect off,2
151195.0,light colors reflect heat so if heat dose hit her car it will reflect onto another car or back at the sun,3
139878.0,i think the best way is using light colored fabric on the inside of the car because is doesn t easily attract heat from the sun also light colored fabric is cooler than the dark colored fabric,2
118549.0,i think that that dark colored fabric because the fabric will block the from hit the car with heat there for the car will stay cool,2
154138.0,because if it is dark it heats up faster then when it is lighter so that why she needs to have the paint lighter than darker its like if she wore black or any dark color it heats up faster than when she were any light color so the same thing happens to the car,2
139843.0,i chose this because the sun reflects off light colors,3
150106.0,the lighter colored white one keeps the inside cold instead the metal one makes it hot,2
154218.0,well if you have like a tan on the inside then it won t attract the sun but if u have black fabric then it will get warm because black attracts the sun,2
141561.0,i picked this because if you use light fabric the inside of the car will be colder because light colors reflect the sun,3
150064.0,light colors don t attract heat,2
154124.0,is you are wearing dark colored clothes outside in the summer you will get hotter the paint ats as the cars clothes,2
139867.0,light colors don t heat and sun as much as dark colors,2
139874.0,light colors don t attracted heat as the dark colors,2
154328.0,light colored paint would work because heat only attracts dark colors like black black attracts heat,2
150143.0,this is because dark colors attracks the sun,2
151174.0,if u use a dark covered fabric and color it will attract the sun,2
151174.0,if it is too dark the sun will get atracted,2
154107.0,doing a light colored paint on the outside and inside because dark colors attracts heat while light color reflects heat,3
154162.0,using light colored fabric would help because then the sun wouldn t get through,2
150237.0,the lighter the color the less the heat comes in,2
136563.0,they will stay cool because of the low albeto,2
139815.0,light colors do not absorb heat as easily as darker colors,3
150135.0,i used the light coloer fabric because the light colors are better the dark makes more heat and light colors dose not,2
154137.0,if the color inside and the color outside is dark from both it will get hot and be attracted to the sun,2
139831.0,using light colors are significant in reducing heat in the car as it sits in the sun as light colors are more easy to release heat as dark colors retain heat better,2
118620.0,because dark fabrics attract sun,2
150105.0,i think she should use light paint and light material because dark atracts heat and light doesn t,3
118400.0,i chose that she should use light colors on her car because dark colors attract the sun,2
151205.0,black colored things suck up the heat from the sun,2
118518.0,the black or dark colors attract heat and contain it unlike light colors that don t attract as much heat,2
151203.0,if you put it on the car then heat get past it,2
118311.0,use a dark colored fabric because when the sunlight hits the window the fabric obsorbs it and has more power to obsorb it,4
151214.0,because it keeps it cool,2
