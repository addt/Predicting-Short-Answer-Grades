118455.0,light colors absorb less heat because black or brown or any dark color absorbs heat and lets it go so it will get hot,3
118367.0,because it can be more cooler,2
118511.0,well if you choose a light color for a car it might not get so hot because if you choose a dark colored car it might heat up faster and stay really hot,2
139827.0,the lighter the color the better because darker colors attract more sunlight,2
136366.0,because using white or light colors wont attrack the suns heat as much and keep the car cool,2
151215.0,lighter colors dont attract as much sun darker colors such as black heat up the car fast,2
150072.0,i chose light colored because the sun doesn t affect light,2
139881.0,because light colors bounce out the heat from the sun,2
118353.0,i think that because dark colors hold in heat that is why people say do not wear black on a hot day,2
153927.0,because if it is in the inside it wont be hot,2
118412.0,since dark colored paint atracts more heat and light colored fabric would not help light colored paint dosent atract as much heat,2
150218.0,light colored things attracted the heat,2
150172.0,i chose this because dark items obsorb heat and light colored items deflect heat,4
153908.0,a light colored fabric so the inside of the car doesn t get that hot and traps in heat,2

151174.0,if it is too dark the sun will get atracted,2
150231.0,this will relflect all the heat,3
118402.0,because the sun goes after dark objects,2
118557.0,by using a light colored paint on the outside of the car it will not atract heat as easily as a dark colored car would by using a light colored fabric on the inside of the car it will also keep the car cooler than a dark colored fabric car would,2
118512.0,i would use a light colored fabric because the light color will attract less heat and the fabric is on the inside where we sit,2
153996.0,i think it is using dark colored fabric because it looks like it will be sunny,2
