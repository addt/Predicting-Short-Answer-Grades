150080.0,well my mom has a black car and it gets super hot,2
153905.0,dark colors attract heat if it is a light color than it will be cooler,2
151201.0,they make it cooler,2
150128.0,light colors reflect heat so the car would stay cooler on the inside because it would reflect the suns rays,4
153928.0,i choose light colored fabric and paint because back and dark colors can attract heat,2
154200.0,well using a light color will help the car maintain cool because light colors woun t atract the sun as much as dark colors,2
150899.0,i choose my answer because heat bounces off the light colors instead of dark colors because dark colors absorb heat,5
118565.0,,1
118534.0,because it will keep the car cool,2
153915.0,the seats wont be warm,2
154224.0,this is my answer because it is te best an,2

154336.0,dark becues the sun wont hit,2
151199.0,i know why because it is an way of life,1
150243.0,i chose this because the dark colored paint will not heat up as fast because of the color and she shouldn t use fabric because it will make it even hotter inside because fabric is warm,2
150201.0,i think you need to use light colors because the barker of the color the hotter it gets,2
154113.0,because dark colored things heat up faster then lightly colored objects,2
118535.0,as u know dark colors attract more heat light and lighter colors attract less heat light so if she had both a light fabric and a light paint her car would stay cooler than the darker painted and darker fabric car would,2
150154.0,if you use light colored paint doesn t attract heat,2
118403.0,if laura uses a light colored paint on the outside it wont attract the sun as much as a dark color,2

139482.0,a light colored paint job would reflect the sunlight meaning the car would not absorb the heat,5
150062.0,i think that she should use dark colored paint on the outside because if u use light colored paint it will make her car hot,2
154193.0,the outside does not matter because the heat is going inside so the fabric will get hot in the car when you sit down,2
149970.0,light colors don t attract sun light,2
118615.0,i choose that answer because that is going to help the car from getting hot,2
136394.0,i think using a light color paint would be better than a dark colored paint because the light color doesn t absorb that much light,4
118464.0,it should be light colored because if it is dark color then it is going to get hot,2
136351.0,i chose to have light colors because they reflect heat and darker colors absorb it,4
118419.0,use light colored fabric because so the heat won t get trap in the car,2
154113.0,because with dark colors like black it gets hotter because of a theory,2
153926.0,dark colors attract the sun so painting the car black or having a dark fabric will make the car hot and she doesn t have to paint he car a light color if she doesn t want to she can just get a light color fabric and put it on the car,2

151182.0,because the dark color won t let the car burn,2
150128.0,since light colors reflect heat it would be important to have light colored elements in the car,3
118519.0,because dark colors attracks the sun and in the car it will be really hot inside the car and the light colors don t attrack the sun a lot,2
150164.0,dark colors absorb heat which is an example of conduction,3
150055.0,using a dark color in the outside cause if u put it inside will get hot but if u put it outside it wont get hot,2
118475.0,dark colors absorb heat more than light colors do,3
151207.0,its because dark colors hold in the heat light colors don t do so much of that,3
151211.0,because dark colors atract sun,2
118599.0,it should be light color because if it is black it would heat more than light color,2

118545.0,it makes sense because the lighter the cooler if you have dark cloth than it will be hotter,2
139509.0,i would think using dark colored fabric on the inside of the car will help keep the car cool while it sits in the sun because the dark colored fabric will help prevent light entering the car,2
154315.0,i would want theose to be both light because dark colors attrack heat,2
151215.0,lighter colors dont attract as much sun darker colors such as black heat up the car fast,2

118470.0,laura should use light fabric and light colored paint because it won t attract as much heat dark colors tend to attract more heat,2
118517.0,because the darker the color is then the more hot it will be so light colors would attract the sun less,2
150208.0,it will keep the car cooler to have a light color paint and fabric because the dark colors have a bigger chance of trapping heat inside of the car,3
154201.0,the sun will not affect the light colored seats,2
154318.0,i think a light colored paint because so it wont heat up and light colored fabric because the car wont get hotter,2

150237.0,the lighter the color the less the heat comes in,2
118592.0,i am going to with light colored on the outside and also the inside because the light color wont atract the sun if you use the dark color you are making the suns heat go inside your car that is why i would use light colors in the inside and the outside the car,2
150226.0,if laura gets dark color on the outside such as black or blue it will attract heat,2
118417.0,because the dark colored car would take all the sun lights heat why ll the inside with light colored fabric will not take that much heat,2
