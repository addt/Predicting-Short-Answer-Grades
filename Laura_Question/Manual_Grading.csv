118544.0,the darker the color the more heat it absorbs so the hotter it gets and the lighter the color the color it gets so the car wont get to hot on the inside if its a lighter color on the inside,3
150133.0,i chose using light colored fabric on the inside of the car because if you use dark colored fabric it will heat up more and the the heat would heat up the air if you use light colored fabric on the inside of the car it will conduct less heat,3
118369.0,nan,1
150215.0,well if you use a whit coler car the sun will reflect of the car,3
118521.0,the fabric will reflect the light and heat away from the car to keep it cool and same with the paint i would use a light fabric over the car,4
139528.0,nan,1
136463.0,i chose light everything because they don t attract heat they reflect it,3
139855.0,darker objects or colors absorbs more heat so the more light the object absorbs lighter colors reflects heat,5
150231.0,the light will relflect the sun,3
136381.0,a light colored paint will help laura keep her car cool because if she had a dark colored paint the paint will absorb all the heat thus making it hot the light colored paint will just reflect off the heat thus making it cooler,4
150120.0,black absorbs heat,3
118448.0,light colors will keep the car cooler because light colors do not absorb heat as well as dark colors thus making the car get less hot,3
,nan,1
139483.0,the light colored fabric will reflect the solar radiation more and therefore allows less chance for the car to absorb the the radiation and warm up,5
136502.0,i think so because according to albedo heat reflects off of light colored things and dark colors aborcs heat,4
149956.0,light colors will not really get that hot compared to dark colors like black the sun will reflect off the black car making it hot with light colors the sun wont reflect off the car with light colors making it not as hot,2
136574.0,i chose this one because when the colors are very light the rays will be reflected and it will not get hot inside and the outside too,4
118520.0,nan,1
136351.0,i chose to have light colors because they reflect heat and darker colors absorb it,4
154303.0,i think using a light colored paint on the outside will help it to make it cool because light colors don t attract the heat but with a dark color for example the color black since black is a dark color it absorbs more heat,3
118533.0,the light colored paint will reflect the heat light,4
118337.0,i picked my answer because i know that dark colors attract and light colors repel,2
150136.0,if i m correct black fabric or black itself attracts the sun and therefore causes the object or person wearing a piece of cloth that is black to heat up in time,3
118559.0,i dont know,1
118348.0,i chose that because bright reflects and dark doesn t,3
118537.0,i think that laura should use a dark color outside her car so when the sun s heat hits the car it will be able to reflect off,2
139796.0,darker colors absorb more heat than lighter colors,3
139495.0,the light colors will cause the light to be reflected whereas dark colors will absorb the light causing the light energy to turn into heat,5
118349.0,light colors don t radiate as much heat as dark cars do,2
150109.0,she should use a light colored paint on the outside because if you use a light colored paint it will reflect the heat,3
150648.0,using light colored things will not absorb the heat like dark colored things,4
139494.0,using a dark colored fabric on the inside of the car will keep the car cool because dark colors attract more heat so the fabric will absorb all the heat from the sun when it hits the car,2
149959.0,because if we used dark colored fabric it will absorb light and make the car hotter,4
136408.0,light colors reflect the light dark colors absorb the light,5
141561.0,i picked this because if you use light fabric the inside of the car will be colder because light colors reflect the sun,3
150915.0,dark colors absorb heat so i assume its the opposite with light colors,3
139795.0,because using a dark colored paint or dark colored fabric can make the car hotter because dark colors absorb more energy or heat,4
139879.0,because light colored fabric will reflect the sun s rays not attract them,2
154107.0,using light colored paint because light colors reflect heat and dark colors attract heat,3
136477.0,i think it will be light colored paint on the outside and light colored fabric on the inside of the car because it will make it reflect the heat outside and not inside,3
153914.0,darker colors attract the sun a car that is painted black and has black fabric on the inside is most likely to get warmer inside than a car painted white with white fabric on the inside,2
150175.0,i chose using a light colored fabric because it will block the heat and also because its a light colored fabric it will not absorb as much heat as a dark colored fabric,4
136462.0,white absorbs more color than black black does not reflect heat,2
136517.0,i think this because the light colored fabric pushes all the heat away and doesn t take any and absorb it,3
153909.0,light colors bounce the sun rays back towards the sun dark colors on the other hand attract the rays to the car,4
136424.0,if it is light it will reflect more light keeping it cool,4
150202.0,using light colors will not absorb the heat,4
139806.0,i think the dark color paint would absorb more heat for the sunlight,4
118321.0,if you put a light colored paint on he outside the car because if you put black on the outside it will get warm faster and if put light color fabric on the inside it will stay fresh and to warm,2
150241.0,i chose to have a light color on the inside and a dark color on the outside because when you have a light color on the inside it will reflect the heat from the inside back to the outside,3
118582.0,so the sun can reflect the sun of the the car,2
139522.0,since dark colors absorb heat it would be best to use a light colored fabric in addition using fabric can help block the sunlight,3
118415.0,i chose these answers because light colors like white or sky blue don t attract or absorb much sunlight,3
139844.0,light colors on a hot day will make you less hot because dark colors absorb heat,3
118613.0,dark colors attract heat and light colors dont attract heat but reflect it,3
139819.0,light colors reflect light more than dark colors,4
139873.0,light colors don t absorb heat as much as the darker colors,3
136555.0,light colors are good at reflecting heat but dark colors are good at getting heat but laura want the car to be cool so she should use light colors,3
136481.0,the white paint will reflect the sun rays away from the car,4
118485.0,the bright white works like a reflection panal and the sunlight bounces of the white,4
118418.0,the light will make the heat bounce away,2
153916.0,lighter colors reflect heat and don t absorb heat,4
118561.0,if she uses light colors she the heat will reflect of the fabric and paint,3
118457.0,the light colored fabric would make solar radiation bounce off the fabric so the car will not get that hot,4
118480.0,i think she should use a light color so that it does not attract the sun,2
136394.0,i picked light colored paint because it would reflect more light and absorb less light then black,4
154135.0,because it will stop the heat longer because it is thicker than the white color fabric so it will reflect,2
118475.0,dark colors absorb heat more than light colors do,3
150243.0,i chose this because the dark colored paint will not heat up as fast because of the color and she shouldn t use fabric because it will make it even hotter inside because fabric is warm,2
154137.0,if laura wants to keep her car cool then she would want to have a plan like parking it under a tree or somewhere shady for example if laura had a black colored car it would be attracted to the sun i think if she has a light colored car and light colored fabric her car wouldn t get hot,2
154340.0,i chose that one because its like tin foil so it just reflect of,3
136474.0,light colors don t absorb as much heat colors as darker colors do,4
150899.0,i choose my answer because heat bounces off the light colors instead of dark colors because dark colors absorb heat,5
136576.0,i think this will help keep her car cool because if she were to have dark colors it would heat up faster because black absorbs all colors of heat but if she were to paint it white or some other light color it will reflect the sun or absorb tiny bits of thus causing her car to be cool,4
136390.0,i had chosen the third one to use light colored fabric and light colored paint because when you use light colored fabric it cools down the car and makes it cooler inside so you will be cooler when you use light colored paint on the outside of your car it wouldn t stay hot on the outside of the car,2
136461.0,the light is being reflected by the light colored things in the car and around it sending the light into the air making it hotter not the car,3
139498.0,since light colors doesn t absorb as much heat as dark colors using a light colored fabric might be necessary to keep the car cool while it sits in the sun,3
151192.0,i have heard that lighter colors don t absorb as much heat and therefore it wouldn t be as hot,3
118545.0,by doing this the color on the outside will reflect more heat than the dark colored one if you use a light colored fabric on the inside it will reflect off more heat than the other fabric,3
136514.0,i chose to use light colored paint on the outside because white reflects the sunlight that will make the car less hot since there is a light color on the outside so the car will not get super hot if there is a light colored paint on the outside of the car,4
139525.0,the light colored fabric inside of the car will not absorb as much heat as the dark colored fabric on the inside of the car,3
139545.0,i think the light colored interior will help keep radiation from being absorbed because the dark colors attract radiation,2
150089.0,i chose a and c because they both represent light colors i know that light colors reflect the sun and dark colors obsorb the sun,4
139865.0,the dark color paint would reflect some of the light out back towards the atmosphere the light colored fabric would reflect some of the light off inside the car,3
139778.0,the light colored paint will reflect the sunlight the heat will decrease then causing the temperature to be lower,4
139823.0,it is known that light colored materials will not absorb as much heat as dark colored materials therefore it is optimal to use as much light colored material in order to absorb as less heat as possible,3
139806.0,i suggest to use a light colored paint on the outside because light colors usually absorb less heat than the dark colors and i also suggest that use light colored fabric on the inside of the car is because fabric is a good insulator because the fabric has little fibers in it to keep the cool air in which means that the fabric is strong,3
139478.0,darker colors such as black absorb the heat and sunlight more efficiently so it would cause laura s car to become hotter that is why using a lighter color paint for her care would be more efficinent because lighter colors reflect light and heat off better,5
136507.0,light colors absorb less heat than dark ones this would cause the heat from the sun to be less effective in heating the car overall,2
118619.0,light colors don t suck as much solar energy,3
118302.0,a light colored paint and light colored fabric on the inside of the car would work because dark colors such as black navy blue and ect would be a bad choice for the car since dark colors absorb heat but light colors don t absorb heat,3
118587.0,i think your car should be a light colored paint because the sun makes the sun hot,2
154194.0,the dark color paint will absorb most of the energy will the fabric will reflect more energy out of the car making it as cool as posible,5
136497.0,white will reflect the heat andthe black would absorb the heat,4
118947.0,dark colors usually absorb heat which is what she doesn t want,3
139778.0,nan,1
150917.0,the sun s radiation is attracted to darker colors the car would get hotter if it had dark colors the car will still get hot with light colors but if you had darker colors the car would be really hot,3
136560.0,because it can reflect the sun from the car,3
136450.0,the light color will reflect the heat on the inside and the outside,3
136512.0,if she wants to keep her car cool then she would want to use a lighter color since lighter colors reflect and darker colors absorb,4
118579.0,the reason i chose light colors is because light colors absorb less heat making it cooler,2
154119.0,light colored options don t observe a lot of heat i know that because i have tested it and the dark colored car is the hottest,3
149961.0,it does not attract sunlight,3
150137.0,i chose those answers because the sun will go to darker colors mostly black but using light colors it will prevent this from happening,3
118411.0,if you used dark colored items they would absorb the heat,3
118368.0,use a light colored fabric to reflect all the heat back at the sun,3
136384.0,if the outside paint is a light color the sun will reflect off of the car before the heat can even get into the car this is why i think laura should go with the light colored paint on the outside,3
136465.0,she should light colors because it reflect the heat,3
139523.0,i think light color fabric will help reflect some of the sun s radiation which will cool down the car or prevent it from getting hotter due to all the heat from the sun not being reflected,4
149965.0,light colors won t observe that much heat compared to dark colors like black or dark gray,4
118522.0,having a light color car will allow it not to obsorbe heat same thing with the inside it will get hot,3
136395.0,since white has a high albedo it will reflect most of the sunlight that hitsit therefore the white colors on the car will help keep the car cool because there will be very little heat absorbed,4
150123.0,i choose the light colored ones because the dark ones attract heat and absorbs it,3
153864.0,you should use light colored options because it doesn t absorb heat like dark colors do,3
150128.0,since light colors reflect heat it would be important to have light colored elements in the car,3
118440.0,you should use light colors on and in the car because the sun aborbs the the dark colors such as black if you have light colors the car will not get as hot that is why when you make solar ovens you use black paper,3
118348.0,i chose that one because bright lights reflect of so it won t be as hot,2
139853.0,you put a light color paint because it does not attract heat as much as dark colored ones,2
136404.0,i belive painting the car a light color and having light colored fabric inside the car reduces heat because white or a light color reflects all light and solar energy so laura s car can stay cooler,4
139518.0,using light colored fabric on the inside of a car will help keep laura cool because the light colors absorb less of the light from the sun if the interior were black then all the energy from the sun s rays will be absorbed,4
139831.0,using light colors are significant in reducing heat in the car as it sits in the sun as light colors are more easy to release heat as dark colors retain heat better,2
154202.0,she should do this because light colored paint will reflect light the other direction,4
136489.0,well if the inside and outside of her car was a darker color the heat would all be absorbed into the seats making it hot if the inside and outside of the car was a lighter color all the heat would reflect off of it instead,4
136500.0,i chose this because light colors reflect the sunlight while black and dark colors absorb the sun light,5
118480.0,i think its important to have light paint on the outside because the it will make it reflect off the car if it were dark paint it would attract the sun instead of reflect it,2
139809.0,darker color absorb more heat than lighter colors,3
139800.0,light colored paint will absorb less heat because it reflects light waves from the sun unlike using dark colors that absorb heat and will cause the car to warm up,5
139785.0,the colour black absorbs heat more effectively than the lighter colors therefore if the paint and fabric are light heat is able to escape more easily,3
154114.0,i think this because dark colors heat up faster but light colors don t as fast,2
136451.0,if it is a light colered paint it will reflect the paint and if there is also a light colerad fabricant it will also reflect the solar heat,3
154327.0,the light paint fabric will reflect off the sun s heat,3
118445.0,i choose these because the black paint absorbs the heat on the outside and the light colored fabric wont absorb the heat in the car not letting the heat leave the seat and out into the air,3
136556.0,i hose light colored paint on the outside because the albedo of the light color will reflect the light,4
118299.0,well if you have a lighter shade of paint on your car and you were in the sun it reflect more to the sun but if you had a darker shade then it wouldnt,3
139521.0,light colored paint reflect most of the light from the solar radiation which less light is absorbed and less heat is stored by the conversion of light energy to heat energy,5
150072.0,i chose light colored objects because the sun doesn t go on light colored objects often,2
136506.0,well light colored things reflect color and light while dark colored objects absorb light and color so that says that light colored objects will keep your car cooler,4
154118.0,dark colors absorb the sun sunlight,4
136364.0,the light colored objects will reflect more light because light colored objects reflect light more,4
139842.0,because when you have a black car your car get warmer faster than having a white car,2
136423.0,light color on the outside would reflect the radition off the car the dark color on the insade would make the heat stay in the fabric,4
136493.0,dark colors absorb heat so her car would get hotter but light colors reflect heat so if she uses light colors her car will be cooler,4
150054.0,light colored objects can reflect the light or keep it from getting warm,4
139643.0,light color absorbs less heat thus the car will be cooler,3
136379.0,using a light color fabric means it reflect light so it doesn t get hot,4
154214.0,because light colors reflect heat and don t absorb heat,4
154208.0,dark colors would not let in as much solar radiation as lighter colors would because it would be harder for solar energy to pass through dark colors,3
136498.0,well if you use light colored fabric or paint the heat will reflect off the colors of heat if you use dark colored fabric and paint the the heat will store the energy from the sun which will make the car hot,5
136454.0,using a light color like white reflects the sun s heat from coming in to the car and becoming too hot,2
136464.0,the reason is that because light color does not absorb as much heat as dark color if she were to put a dark color in or outside of her car it would make the temperature increase but however with a light color it will reflect the heat and make the cars temperature cooler same instead of getting hot that is my reasoning for this question,4
139802.0,the dark colors attracts more heat i don t know why but it does and if we use light colors it will keep the car cool,2
136393.0,if you have lighter colors the less light will be absorbed making it cooler inside the car,3
139851.0,nan,1
136420.0,the light colors will reflect most but the darker colors will absorb most,4
139534.0,using a light colored paint and fabric would reduce the amount of heat energy being absorbed from the sun since light color reflects all the wavelengths of light and therefore absorbs least heat,5
118486.0,i chose that because light colors don t really absorb the heat so it won t get really hot inside the car as dark colors do absorb the heat and it will get really hot inside the car,3
136460.0,if it s really hot outside the sun is going to be beating down on laura s car the white paint will reflect the heat to help not enter the car the light colored seats will also help reflect the heat in case her windows are not reflective the seats can reflect hat back outside the car,3
150199.0,dark would not work because the sun is attracted to dark colors not light colors so the sun will bounce off the light colors,3
139495.0,because light colored fabric does not absorb light and reflects it,4
136500.0,i choose these options because of albedo dark colors absorb the sun which makes the car hotter lighter colors reflect the light making the car less hot,5
118344.0,i chose the light covered fabric because dack stuff absorb the light and heat it up more,4
136389.0,darker things absorb heat and energy this makes it warmer if you use lighter colors like white then it will reflect the heat and energy this makes the car in this situation cooler the light car and fabric will reflect heat and energy making the car cool on a hot day,4
150098.0,this is because the color black or darker colors attract the sun and the color white or lighter colors reflect the sun,3
139542.0,a lighter color would reflect heat,3
150057.0,i did not choose dark because darker colors absorb more heat,3
118584.0,,1
139810.0,nan,1
136354.0,i chose thoughts because the solar radiation will not get absorbed and it will not get to hot,4
139479.0,lighter colored material absorbs less light compared to darker colored materials,4
150170.0,i think she should use a light colored fabric in the car because if you used a dark colored fabric in the car it will get hot because darker colors absorb more heat,3
139876.0,because using a light colored paint on the outside helps the car to reflect the sun s heat therefore it won t be absorbed a,3
153921.0,dark colors absorb heat but light colors don t if you have a dark color it would adsorb the heat and make it hotter inside,3
154334.0,dark colers ovsorb,3
151176.0,dark colors attract the sunlight,3
139541.0,less heat is absorbed when the color is light and more reflection occurs if the light is light rather than dark less heat will be absorbed and therefore it will keep the car cool,4
154325.0,using black fabric and paint will make the car hotter the color will absorb heat quicker if it is a dark color because it is dark and dark colors don t deflect heat as well as light colors do light colors will deflect heat more because of their brightness,4
118455.0,light colors absorb less heat because black or brown or any dark color absorbs heat and lets it go so it will get hot,3
136374.0,these heat sources will reflect most of the heat keeping her car cool,2
118525.0,using a light colored car and light colored fabric on the inside will make the car cool because dark colored things attract the sun,2
136355.0,to keep the car cool you don t want a dark color because all it will do is absorb the heat also the lighter the color the less it absorbs heat,3
136553.0,because darker things adsorb and will get hotter and lighter things don t adsorb they reflect so if it reflect the sun light then it won t get hot,5
136558.0,because dark colored objects absorb heat,3
118338.0,usually dark colors attract the sun and light colors usually reflect off the sun so if you get or have a light colored car it will reflect off of the sun and will not attract the heat,3
118401.0,light colors don t obsorb as much light as the dark colors,4
139538.0,since black colored objects absorb heat better the lighter colored objects would help decrease the amount of heat being absorbed allowing the car to become less hotter,3
118539.0,tis reflects the light outwards,3
118614.0,i chose those answers because if you have a dark colored car and lets say leather seat your car is automatically absorbing heat from the sun which makes your car hot,2
136421.0,the light color lets say white will reflect the heat rays from the sun,3
139848.0,nan,1
136506.0,well if you pick anything black to use then it s going to suck in lots of heat because of all the colors going into it so in the end it will be hotter but if you picked colored equipment then all colors but that certain color won t go in the object so colored objects are cooler than black objects,2
149971.0,lololo,1
139488.0,dark colored things absorb more heat than light colored things therefore dark colored fabric or paint would be more hot than light colored ones,3
118465.0,light colors have very high reflectivity so they wouldn t absorb as much solar radiation,5
136362.0,light color will reflect the light so it does not come in to the car and i see people put those inside the car to keep it from getting hot,4
136477.0,i put using light colored fabric on the inside of the car because light colors reflect,3
136453.0,i chose a and c because lighter colors reflect light meanwhile darker colors absorb light creating heat heating up the car,5
118580.0,i choose that answer because it might reflect off the car using the light coverd paint,2
153852.0,i chose black because it wont reflect and there is going to be no bright light inside the car and white will reflect and will make the sun come towards the car even more,3
118345.0,this is right because this paint will reflect the heat,2
150069.0,this is true because when a black or dark colored car is in the sun it gets really hot inside and on the outside but with a white or light colored colored car is left in the sun it isn t as hot inside and out,2
139540.0,we learned that the color that is closer to black or a darker color would absorb more light than a light color,4
118567.0,you should use light colored paint and fabric in and out of the car because light colored things don t absorb heat dark colored things do though,3
118315.0,i agree with my choice because for example light reflects off of light colors like white or lighter colors where as colors like black take in light making it heated,4
139849.0,the car fabric conducts heat from the light outside,4
136391.0,i chose light color fabric because the darker the fabric like black the light can not reflect making it hot,4
154128.0,light is attracted to dark colors so by using light colors your car will not be as open to the radiation,3
136497.0,that is becuase i know for a fact that white keeps you cool and black keeps you hot so you should choose the lighter color,2
139524.0,light colors will reflect heat whereas darker colors will reflect it,3
118531.0,i chose this because if there was a black fabric inside and a dark colored paint on the out side it will collect heat but with a light color it deflects the heat therefor making the car cool,2
151188.0,i think this because when i wear a black shirt all the heat soaks in and im hot so i know that laura should do a light colored paint so that way if she does do a dark color then it will be soaked in heat,3
153921.0,using light fabric because the sun is attracted to dark colors and if you use a light color it won t get to hot,2
118357.0,because a back colored paint or fabric will absorb the heat,3
118550.0,light colors reflect heat,3
136359.0,if you have a light colored paint on the outside your car will reflect heat instead of absorbing heat and if you have a light colored fabric inside your car the fabric won t get super hot,3
136513.0,because we ve learned that darker colors absorb heat and lighter colors reflect heat,4
118299.0,well if you had a dark colored fabric on the inside it would nor reflect as much as the light colored fabric and for the dark colored cars well that would help just a little but it would still reflect,3
153818.0,light colored things are more reflective and will heat up less,3
150169.0,so it can work,2
139485.0,dark colored fabrics allow for the heat to be trapped for example if you were black colored clothing on a hot day you will get hotter instead of cooling off the light colored fabric in the inside of the car will allow the radiation to get trapped onto the fabric but it will not go any further than the fabric,3
136465.0,you need something bright to reflect the heat,2
118477.0,the reason why i chose using a light color on the outside of the car was because if you have a dark color on the outside dark colors attracts the sun to automatically hit you r car so its better to get a light color same goes with the inside color it should also be better to choose a light color as well,2

136574.0,i think this is the best option because light colors are more related to white which reflects the light and dark colors are related to black which absorbs light,5
139853.0,a light colored fabric will help it cool because it won t absorb as much heat from the inside which will keep the car cool,3
139511.0,choosing a light color paint will help reflect some of that ultraviolet radiation from the sun because if you have a dark colored car the darker color will absorb a lot of the heat from the sun increasing the temperature paint color is a important factor for the temperature on the inside and outside of your car so chose a light colored paint for your car if you live in a warm place also depending on where you live will affect what paint type you want,2
139519.0,light colors reflect light so much of the sunlight that hits the car s surface can be reflected off,4
154195.0,first of all dark colors attract sunlight so the and answers would not work secondly light colors repel heat energy the answer must be or i think it is one because that would allow the heat to not enter in the first place if the dark colored paint on the outside attract the heat by the time it wants to escape because of the light seats it would already be trapped,3
139496.0,using any dark colored items fabric or paint will absorb all the heat from the sun and everything will warm up as a result the opposite would be best to keep things cool in the sun,2
