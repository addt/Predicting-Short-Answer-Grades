154318.0,it is,1
139643.0,darker colors absorb more heat so by using a lighter colored paint and fabric which absorbs less heat this will help keep the car cooler,3
136364.0,the light colors will reflect more light because the closer the color is to white the more the color will reflect keeping the car cooler inside,4
118613.0,dark colors attract heat and light colors dont attract heat but reflect it,3
150202.0,using light colors will not absorb the heat,4
153917.0,i think this because the light color don t prevent heat and dark colors do and i also think the light colored fabric will work also because it won t burn your behind,2
150242.0,the bright colors reflect heat while dark ones absorb more heat,4
150230.0,sun and heat reflect of light colors,3
153844.0,i think it would have to be a light color because dark colors attrack and absorb heat so maybe a light color would do the oppisite,3
118601.0,light colors reflect light so a light colored paint might help,3
118364.0,the light colored paint will reflect the sun away,3
151188.0,i think this because when i wear a black shirt all the heat soaks in and im hot so i know that laura should do a light colored paint so that way if she does do a dark color then it will be soaked in heat,3
118443.0,dark colors in the sun will obsorbe the heat around it lightly colored paint fabric etc will keep the car more cooled than darkly colored paint fabric etc will,3
149950.0,because the sun reflects off bright colors,3
118463.0,because the light colored paint could reflect the suns heat,2
136408.0,darker colors absorb heat lighter colors reflect heat,4
139544.0,in order to keep the car nice and cool while it sits in the sun using a light color would be the best choice because light colors tend to absorb less heat and reflect all wavelengths of light,4
136501.0,i think this because light colors reflect heat more than dark colors so the light colored fabric and light colored paint will reflect the heat that would make the car warm hot,3
118448.0,the darker the color the more heat it absorbs and the lighter the color the more heat it reflects so a light colored fabric and paint would make the car cooler than a dark colored fabric and paint,4
136476.0,i chose using a light colored paint on the outside of the car because light paint will reflect the sun as the dark paint will absorb the heat i also chose use light colored fabric on the inside of the car because of the same thing,4
136391.0,i chose light color fabric because the darker the fabric like black the light can not reflect making it hot,4
136389.0,darker things absorb heat and energy this makes it warmer if you use lighter colors like white then it will reflect the heat and energy this makes the car in this situation cooler the light car and fabric will reflect heat and energy making the car cool on a hot day,4
149956.0,light colors will not really get that hot compared to dark colors like black the sun will reflect off the black car making it hot with light colors the sun wont reflect off the car with light colors making it not as hot,2
139542.0,a lighter color would reflect heat,3
139533.0,lighter colors reflect more sun rays than dark colors do so keeping everything light will allow the car to stay cooler since the heat is being reflected away,4
139863.0,using a dark color such as black will absorb more heat rather than using a lighter color which will reflect the heat,4
136393.0,if you have lighter colors the less light will be absorbed making it cooler inside the car,3
139506.0,since we are talking about the inside of the car we don t want to know about the outside material since using a light fabric is best because it reflects the most light and it also doesn t let the air particles heat up,4
154128.0,the sun rays are attracted to dark colors so by using a light color on the outside it won t let the heat come i,3
136408.0,light colors reflect the light dark colors absorb the light,5
154846.0,laura should use light colored fabric for the inside and the outside of the car because light colors don t absorb heat as much as dark colors do,3
154314.0,if the paint and fabric of the car were black it would not be able to reflect paint away so light colored paint and fabric is good,3
136483.0,i chose these answers because light colors such as white reflects light and keeps the car cooler then it would if you use dark colored things on your car,4
136398.0,i picked these choices because dark colors like black are known to absorb heat light colors like white are known to reflect light this explains my choices,5
136504.0,i think it will be a light color outside because i makes the suns radiation reflect and not make the car as hot as a black or darker color if you change what is inside and the outside is dark the car will absorve the heat because its black even if the inside is cool it doesn t mean the outside is to,5
139826.0,light colored paint reflects light waves being emitted from the sun so it will not absorb the sun s heat dark colors actually absorb heat therefore if the car were to be painted dark it would absorb the sun s heat and warm up,5
136480.0,because it s like if you wear dark closet you get hot like black closet so for it s the same for cars as well the reason why is because like dark colors has a low albedo and absorbs a lot of light and light colors are the same but it doesn t absorb it reflects,4
136423.0,light colored paint on the outside would make the car cooler because light colors deflect the sun s radiation on the inside there should be dark colored fabric becuase then it won t deflect heat onto the inside of the car instead it will soak in the heat,5
118484.0,i did this one because light reflect the light and dark odserb,4
118550.0,using a dark color like black will absorb the heat to make laura s car more hot using a light color like gold will repel the heat,3
118345.0,this is right because this paint will reflect the heat,2
136566.0,i chose this because white colored stuff reflects heat and a dark colored fabric on the inside because all the heat in the car will be absorb into the sun shade,4
118439.0,the dark fabric and paint absorbs the suns energy and the light colored fabric and paint usually reflects the light,5
139505.0,a light colored fabric paint reflects more sunlight and the energy that comes along with it,4
118356.0,light colored things reflects light and heat when dark colors absorb light and heat,5
136522.0,i think using light colored fabric in the inside of the car is most important to keep the car not too hot because then it won t absorb a lot of heat and laura will probably want the inside of the car to kep cool and will not care very much about the outside being hot,3
139790.0,all these light colored material will help bounce back the solar radiation,4
118529.0,i think that she should use a light colored fabric that goes on the inside because the light colors don t obsorbe heat well they do but dark colors obsorbe more heat so if the fabric is light colored then the car will still be warm but not that much,3
136387.0,light colors reflects light and results as something as being cooler or less hot if you have dark colors they will obsorb rayes from the sun resulting as the car being hot,5
6971.0,when its a hot day you would like to wear white because it keeps you cooler because the white is a more lighter color if you wear black the sun will reflect and make you hotter that is why i choose using a light colored paint on the outside,2
118544.0,because darker colors absorb more heat the lighter the color the cooler it stays,3
139522.0,using light colored fabric keeps the air cool and reflects the heat molecules,2
139787.0,light colored paint on the outside cause the color wont absorb that much heat than the darker colors,3
118440.0,you should use light colors because when you use light colors the sun reflects off of the car if your car is dark the sun will atract it and it will heat your car up,3
136455.0,white light colors reflect light so black and dark shades would be a dangerous choice if you want to not be hot in the summer sun,4
118483.0,if you use light colored fabric inside the car the sun s heat will be reflected by the fabric,2
150215.0,if you have bright coler car it will reflect,3
136422.0,using a light colored paint or fabric absorbs less heat than dark colored paint and fabric,3
150228.0,the sun will reflect from the windshield,3
155334.0,because it can reflect the sun light from getting the car hot,4
136419.0,the white paint on the outside of the car will reflect the light and heat and the dark fabric on the inside will absorb light and heat,5
136418.0,i think she should use this because it can keep her car colder and not so hot because its a light color and the sun bounces off light colors so if laura wants to keep her car cool that is what she needs,3
118315.0,because when making a solar oven my partner and i used dark colors but if you want to cool down your car you should use light colors so it reflects light so that way laura can keep your car from getting to hot,4
136360.0,so it reflects the suns heat,2
139526.0,by using light colored fabric on the inside of the car less sunlight will be absorbed and it will be reflected instead,5
136500.0,i choose these options because of albedo dark colors absorb the sun which makes the car hotter lighter colors reflect the light making the car less hot,5
136387.0,the light colored car and fabrics will reflect most of the rays from the sun resulting as the car being cooler,4
153816.0,dark colors conduct heat,2
118454.0,lighter colors reflect the sun away,3
150062.0,i chose light colored fabric because if you use dark colored fabric it will absorb more heat so light colored fabric does not absorb as much heat as dark colored fabric,4
136572.0,light colers dont absorb the suns energy but black does,4
139529.0,using light color because it doesn t absorb heat more then black color,3
136457.0,light colors reflect reflects sunlight and they don t absorb much heat compared to dark colors they absorb a lot of heat and sunlight so using light colors would probably but still your car is a hunk of metal still going to heat up unless you find a tree to hind under,5
136463.0,i chose light everything because they don t attract heat they reflect it,3
139535.0,using light colored paint and fabric on the car will reflect radiation preventing heat from being able to penetrate and collect in the car,4
153991.0,light colored objects don t absorb as much heat,3
153999.0,the light colored stuff does not obsorb as much heat,3
153909.0,light colors bounce the sun rays back towards the sun dark colors on the other hand attract the rays to the car,4
136474.0,light colors don t absorb as much heat colors as darker colors do,4
118348.0,i chose that one because bright lights reflect of so it won t be as hot,2
139493.0,light colored things reflect light which means the suns rays will be reflected while dark colors things absorb light which means it will absorbs the suns rays,5
151192.0,i have heard that lighter colors don t absorb as much heat and therefore it wouldn t be as hot,3
150089.0,i chose a and c because they both represent light colors i know that light colors reflect the sun and dark colors obsorb the sun,4
150075.0,when using a light color the heat reflects off it but when using a dark color it absorbs the heat,4
118533.0,light colors don t trap as much heat as dark color,2
136352.0,the lighter the color the more light and heat gets reflected dark colors absorb more heat,4
136414.0,i chose those things because white reflects the sun,3
139870.0,the lighter the color of the car both interior and exterior the more energy heat will be reflected keeping it cool,4
150172.0,i chose this because dark items obsorb heat and light colored items deflect heat,4
139498.0,since light colors doesn t absorb as much heat as dark colors using a light colored fabric might be necessary to keep the car cool while it sits in the sun,3
136451.0,if it is a light colered paint it will reflect the paint and if there is also a light colerad fabricant it will also reflect the solar heat,3
136477.0,i put using light colored fabric on the inside of the car because light colors reflect,3
118536.0,dark colors absorb the heat energy making it hotter,4
136459.0,if your car isn t black it won t attract heat from the inside or outside of the car because the sun won t even want to look or point towards it if it isn t black or any dark color depending on the type of radiation that gets put down,2
139479.0,darker colors absorb larger amounts of energy from the sun,4
118614.0,i chose those answers because if you have a dark colored car and lets say leather seat your car is automatically absorbing heat from the sun which makes your car hot,2
136389.0,laura wants to make her car cooler on a hot day if she wants to do this the light colored paint and and fabric is what she should use the light colored paint and fabric will have more white in it and the white reflects the sun the heat and solar radiation will not go into the car but it will reflect it away if she used the dark colored paint and fabric it would absorb the solar radiation making the car warmer and that is not what she wants to do,5
139535.0,darker colors tend to attract more heat from the sun if the outside is a darker color the heat will be attracted to the outside if the interior is light it will absorb less heat and allow the interior to be cooler,2
118400.0,i think the outside and inside of the car should be light colored because the dark colors really absorb a lot of solar energy and light colors do not,4
139525.0,the light colored fabric inside of the car will not absorb as much heat as the dark colored fabric on the inside of the car,3
136451.0,because if you put a darker color paint on the car it will absorb the solar energy why as the light color on the outside will reflect the solar energy,5
150648.0,using light colored things will not absorb the heat like dark colored things,4
118412.0,because having a dark colored painted car atracts more sunlight as well as dark colored fabric,3
139537.0,light colors can reflect more light which means reflect more radiation that produces heat the more light it reflects the less heat that will reach in the car and the car will be cooler than a car that has a darker color,4
136366.0,white has a higher albeodo than black because white reflects light while black exorbes it so when you have black fabric in your car the seats will be super hot so thats why you should have whiite fabric and a white paint,4
154108.0,i chose using light colored fabric and using a light colored paint because when the sun rays hit the light color it won t absorb as much as it would to a dark colored one for example if its a hot day and you re wearing a light colored shirt such as white it wont be as hot but if you wear a dark colored shirt such as black it will be very hot so when the sun rays go through the car windows it won t absorb the fabric as long as it is a light color,4
136420.0,the light colors will reflect most of the heat back of the car but if you had dark colors than the heat would be absorbed into the car making it hot,4
118560.0,when you put dark colored fabric the sun reflects dark colored fabric,2
139488.0,dark colored things absorb more heat than light colored things therefore dark colored fabric or paint would be more hot than light colored ones,3
136495.0,there should be all light colors on her car because it will reflect the sunlight and heat if she used dark colors they would absorb all the heat and make the inside of the car extremely more hot,5
118456.0,i picked light colored paint and fabric because the sun reflects off of light colors and darker colors attract the heat,3
118538.0,the light fabric reflects the sun and heat from going inside the car,3
154107.0,using light colored paint because light colors reflect heat and dark colors attract heat,3
118588.0,so the car won t absorb heat inside,2
136685.0,it will absorb the less light,3
151194.0,i just guessed,1
139543.0,this is because since white absorbs the least amount of heat the outside color would still make a difference but the inside is what really matters because the air is trapped inside with no opening,3
118401.0,light colors don t absorb as much energy from the sun as you can with dark colors,4
139527.0,light colors reflect heat more than darker colors which absorb heat,4
136471.0,because white reflects an black absorbs,4
136462.0,i chose a light colored paint because the white absorbes abeto so it won t get too hot then i chose the dark fabric inside because the black absorbes the sun rays so it won t heat up,4
149588.0,using light colored fabric will not keep the sun in but it will let the heat reflect off the light colored fabric,4
149972.0,having two layers of light colored things will let minimal heat in any heat that gets in won t get absorbed into the car because there is light colored fabric,3
118575.0,dark colors absorbs light and heat light colors,3
139873.0,light colors don t absorb heat as much as the darker colors,3
118349.0,light colors don t radiate as much heat as dark cars do,2
118319.0,because a dark color like black attract the heat but light colors like wight reflect the heat,3
149963.0,i chose those two answers because anything with a light color like white reflects of the heat from the sun so it doesn t get as hot as dark colored things,4
118343.0,it should be a light color outside the car like white because light colors don t absorb the heat like dark colors do,3
139478.0,darker colors such as black absorb the heat and sunlight more efficiently so it would cause laura s car to become hotter that is why using a lighter color paint for her care would be more efficinent because lighter colors reflect light and heat off better,5
136476.0,i chose using a light colored paint on the outside of the car because light colors reflect other colors i also chose using light colored fabric on the inside of the car because of the same reason,3
139861.0,it will reflect more light and it will not attract as much heat compared to a dark color,2
139875.0,the darker it is the more heat you re going to attract dark conducts more heat,2
118307.0,because light colors absorb less heat,3
150077.0,light colors prevent heat from going inside and creating conduction dark colors take the heat and seal it so that it goes inside so if your car is hot it s probably because you have dark colors on the inside and or outside,4
139769.0,dark colors absorb heat more than light colors using light colors will help reflect the light away from the car and the heat,5
118510.0,dark colors hold more heat so if you use light colors the heat wont get absorbed as much,3
136502.0,i think so because according to albedo heat reflects off of light colored things and dark colors aborcs heat,4
139768.0,lighter colors bounce light off while darker absorbs the heat making it hotter,4
139839.0,light colors will bounce off the car which means it wont be absorbing as much energy so it wont be as hot,5
150169.0,so it can work,2
150921.0,black absorbs all light and turns it into heat but white does not,5
139486.0,since light colored materials reflect light rather than absorb it is the best solution to the problem so instead of the car absorbing a lot of sun lights it will just absorb a little,5
