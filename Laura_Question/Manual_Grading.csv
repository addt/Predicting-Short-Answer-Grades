139539.0,the solar radiation bounces off and does not get absorbed because black does not have a heat wave than other colors the brighter the light is the more heat energy there is,3
139831.0,using light colors are significant in reducing heat in the car as it sits in the sun as light colors are more easy to release heat as dark colors retain heat better,2
139513.0,using a light colored fabric on the inside of the car will absorb less heat than that off a darker colored,3
139769.0,the lighter colors will not absorb heat as much,3
118557.0,by using light colored paint on the outside it will reflect off more heat than a dark colored paint that will just absorb the heat by using a light colored fabric on the inside of the car it will also reflect off more heat than a dark colored fabric would,4
154319.0,i beleive this because darker colered things absorb more radiation from the sun and i know that becuse i have read it in science articles and been told off my brother went to osu,4
118510.0,dark colors hold more heat so if you use light colors the heat wont get absorbed as much,3
150108.0,hit was c,1
151188.0,i think this because when i wear a black shirt all the heat soaks in and im hot so i know that laura should do a light colored paint so that way if she does do a dark color then it will be soaked in heat,3
150070.0,because dark colors attract heat more than lighter colors so that is why she should use lighter colors inside and outside of the car,3
150143.0,sun shines on dark colored thing but reflects off light colored things,3
150085.0,i chose my answers because black absorbs heat making it hotter white on the other hand reflects heat making it cooler,5
153839.0,if you have a dark color on he inside and outside of our car it will attract the car and absorb the heat,3
118298.0,the light colored paint on the outside will reflect the heat back out from the car also with the light colored fabric inside but if there was dark colored fabric and paint it will absorb the heat in the car,4
149590.0,because ussaly dark soaks up the heat,3
136481.0,the white paint will reflect the sun rays away from the car,4
118366.0,light colors reflect light,3
154137.0,if laura wants to keep her car cool then she would want to have a plan like parking it under a tree or somewhere shady for example if laura had a black colored car it would be attracted to the sun i think if she has a light colored car and light colored fabric her car wouldn t get hot,2
136414.0,i chose those things because white reflects the sun,3
118579.0,it will because it reflects light and heat,3
153979.0,because light colors help the sun reflect of dark colors make the sun stay on for hours,2
136354.0,i chose toughs answers because the light colored stuff reflects the sun and the dark colors stuff obsorbes the light,5
139774.0,using a light color will keep the car cool while it sits in the sun because darker colors make it hot and darker colors absorbs more heat while light colors helps us cool when its hot,3
139507.0,if laura wants to keep her car cool while it sits in the sun then it is best to avoid getting a car that has dark colors both inside and out dark colors like black absorb a lot more heat than lighter colors so that means if the car is dark inside and out it will get a lot warmer than a car than is lighter in color,3
150248.0,i picked this because then it won t reflect that much,3
139841.0,light colored fabric would allow for less radiation absorption,4
139836.0,using dark colors will heat up your cars faster than the lighter colored paints or fabric because dark colors absorbs more heat rather than reflecting it using a lighter color would reflect most of the heat because it does not need to absorbs the colors of the sun as much as the darker colored ones,4
136508.0,i chose using light colors because light colors will reflect the light and it will make the car cooler the paint out on the outside would reflect the light and te carwould be cool,4
150228.0,the light colored paint reflects the suns reflection,3
136454.0,using a light color like white reflects the sun s heat from coming in to the car and becoming too hot,2
139513.0,using light color fabric on the insides will help prevent the solar radiation from the sun from being absorbed by the fabrics,4
139870.0,with a lighter color like white the sun reflects its heat away more efficiently than with a darker color like black which absorbs heat,2
139769.0,dark colors absorb heat more than light colors using light colors will help reflect the light away from the car and the heat,5
136404.0,anything light colored reflects solar energy this is called having a high albedo albedo is how much an objects reflects if laura wanted a hot car she would use black paint and black fabric because black absorbs solar energy rather than reflecting it,5
118355.0,the heat reflects the light,3
150131.0,dark colored fabric is known to contract heat energy if she doesn t want to make her car hot by the end of the summer then she can use all light colored fabric or paint,3
136557.0,light reflects color but also some heat black absorbs all colors and absorbs heat fabric traps heat and it becomes stuffy,4
150230.0,my choice is keep the car light colored because heat reflects off light,3
136366.0,white has a higher albeodo than black because white reflects light while black exorbes it so when you have black fabric in your car the seats will be super hot so thats why you should have whiite fabric and a white paint,4
139813.0,use colors that isn t black because black cars absorb heat faster than others,3
139535.0,using light colored paint and fabric on the car will reflect radiation preventing heat from being able to penetrate and collect in the car,4
139521.0,light colored paint reflect most of the light from the solar radiation which less light is absorbed and less heat is stored by the conversion of light energy to heat energy,5
139480.0,a light colored paint will allow for less radiation to be absorbed by the sun making the car feel cool even though it has been in the sun,4
139529.0,because the darker color absorb more heat then the light color,3
136388.0,light colors reflect most the color light for example a white car reflects all the light colors the car stays cool because it reflect all the light that came from the sun the sun is hot which makes me think the colors are hot when they aren t reflected or at anytime,2
118466.0,heat bounces off of light colored things and is attracted to dark things,2
150223.0,you would put something like black on the outside of the car because the color will capture any heat that is trying to get in and the light color in the car is because if the black color fails then the light fabric will reflect the heat out of the car,3
136493.0,dark colors absorb heat so her car would get hotter but light colors reflect heat so if she uses light colors her car will be cooler,4
136512.0,if she wants to keep her car cool then she would want to use a lighter color since lighter colors reflect and darker colors absorb,4
118555.0,using a dark color paint toward the inside of the car will make it cooler because the sun will reflect back on it and it will just bounce back up and it will make the car cooler,2
139479.0,darker colors absorb larger amounts of energy from the sun,4
118483.0,using light colored fabric is good because light colored fabric reflects heat,3
154194.0,i chose this answer because the dark color paint will only make the metal hot on the outside when you have light color fabric on the inside the energy will come in through the glass but the fabric will not absorb as much energy as the dark fabric or paint and the energy would just bounce out of the car,5
153909.0,light colors in general reflect the suns radiation back to the sun but dark colors do the opposite they attract heat that s why she need a light color paint and cloth rather then a dark paint and cloth,4
136494.0,i said using a light colored paint on the outside of the car because then the car will reflect the light from going inside the car,4
118460.0,using a light colored fabric on the inside because if you put a dark colored one it can attract sunlight,3
136490.0,white and lighter colors reflect the light and does not heat up black and darker colors absorb almost all of the light that is hitting the car,5
139747.0,i think that using a light colored paint on the outside of the car will prevent the car getting hotter because the lighter the color will be the the shinier it is to bounce sun rays back to the atmosphere,4
150206.0,well the light colors reflects the sun and that may help for her,3
153917.0,i think this because the light color don t prevent heat and dark colors do and i also think the light colored fabric will work also because it won t burn your behind,2
136516.0,light colors reflect heat dark colors absorb heat,4
136499.0,she should use us light colored paint on the outside and a dark colored fabric on the inside the light colored paint wil reflect the sun s light and the dark colored fabric will absorb the heat on the inside of the car,4
136398.0,i picked these choices because dark colors like black are known to absorb heat light colors like white are known to reflect light this explains my choices,5
136381.0,a light colored paint will help laura keep her car cool because if she had a dark colored paint the paint will absorb all the heat thus making it hot the light colored paint will just reflect off the heat thus making it cooler,4
139834.0,that way the light is reflected off the car rather than absorbing it like a dark colored car would,4
136393.0,if she uses a light colored paint on the outside more light will be reflected away unlike a dark color of paint which will absorb the light turning into heat if she uses a dark fabric on the inside the car will absorb the heat making it hotter if she uses a light colored fabric inside the more heat will reflect out,4
154846.0,laura should use light colored fabric for the inside and the outside of the car because light colors don t absorb heat as much as dark colors do,3
136580.0,i think that laura would need a light colored paint on the outside of her car because then the sun would have less heat radiating off of the car,2
139847.0,you should have light colored paint to reflect more light elsewhere rather then retain it in the car and you would have a larger area of high reflectivity than a light color fabric would on the inside,4
139497.0,lighter colors reflect sun rays while darker colors absorb them it would be wise for laura to use a light colored fabric on the inside and get a car than has a lighter shade in order to reflect sunlight,5
150648.0,using light colored things will not absorb the heat like dark colored things,4
136553.0,because darker things adsorb and will get hotter and lighter things don t adsorb they reflect so if it reflect the sun light then it won t get hot,5
136495.0,there should be all light colors on her car because it will reflect the sunlight and heat if she used dark colors they would absorb all the heat and make the inside of the car extremely more hot,5
154107.0,using light colored paint because light colors reflect heat and dark colors attract heat,3
118459.0,using the light color fabric and the color paint it will reflect of the heat like color fabric,3
139775.0,because dark colors absorb laura should use a light colored paint on the outside so that it heat doesn t go into the car,3
136515.0,i think she should use light colored paint and fabric because lighter colors reflect heat unlike dark colors,3
139533.0,lighter colors reflect heat while darker colors absorb the heat and make the inside of the car hotter,4
136477.0,i put using light colored fabric on the inside of the car because light colors reflect,3
136377.0,i choose this because black absorbs more color and white reflects making the white things cooler and black hotter,4
136455.0,white light colors reflect light so black and dark shades would be a dangerous choice if you want to not be hot in the summer sun,4
136394.0,i picked light colored paint because it would reflect more light and absorb less light then black,4
154127.0,i chose light paint because darker colors absorb heat better than light colors and that means the paint won t absorb a lot of heat and energy therefore keeping it cool,4
136501.0,i think this because the light colors on the outside of her car would reflect back some of the solar radiation making it less hot also that would be the same for having light colored fabric inside of the car,4
136391.0,i think its black because light can reflect off all colors but black so if it does not reflect it would be going direct towards it and get kept there,4
153836.0,light colored materials such as paint and fabric attract less solar radiation than darker materials do,3
139833.0,light colors do not absorb as much heat as dark fabrics so if you use a light colored paint and a light color interior the car will not trap as much heat inside as a dark colored combination,3
136420.0,the light colors will reflect most of the heat back of the car but if you had dark colors than the heat would be absorbed into the car making it hot,4
139864.0,so the insides dont absorb heat but instead reflects it so that i leaves the car,4
150109.0,she should use a light colored paint on the outside because if you use a light colored paint it will reflect the heat,3
118482.0,because,2
118297.0,using light colored outside and inside paint will make it cooler than having the dark paint absorbing sun light and the make the car hot,4
150219.0,laura will want a light colored car because then it will not absorb heat it will reflect it,4
118556.0,it should be white because the black things absorb the sun and the white does not do that,3
136481.0,since dark colours like black navy blue and ect make things hotter by attracting heat people can change that by using light colours to reflect heat,2
139495.0,the light colors will cause the light to be reflected whereas dark colors will absorb the light causing the light energy to turn into heat,5
139865.0,the dark color paint would reflect some of the light out back towards the atmosphere the light colored fabric would reflect some of the light off inside the car,3
118437.0,light keeps the reflects the sun,3
118561.0,for example if the car is painted white on the outside the heat will bounce off it and if the fabric is white on the inside it won t absorb it,2
136564.0,using almost anything light colored helps because light colors have a high albedo so the light reflects and goes somewhere else besides the car dark colors have low albedos and so the heat would be absorbed making the car hotter,5
139775.0,light colors reflect the sun unlike dark colors which absorb the sun,4
149957.0,she should use light color paint on the outside and light fabric inside because light colored stuff bounces light off because it is already light while dark colored stuff absorbs the hot light and that makes it hot,5
139477.0,the light color paint and fabric will not absorb as much light as a dark color fabric,4
136453.0,i chose a and c because lighter colors reflect light meanwhile darker colors absorb light creating heat heating up the car,5
136362.0,the light color on the outside will reflect the heat the darker the object the warmer it is if the light is on the outside it will reflect outside so it will not reach inside the car,3
136425.0,you pick light colors because it reflects the sun s light which creates heat if she chose dark colors it would be hotter because dark colors black for instance absorbs heat,5
118450.0,i think laura should put light colored paint on her car because if you put dark colored paint on the car for example black paint the burning light heat from the sun would contrast with the dark paint and make the heat super strong if you have light color the sun would not have to contrast as much and the heat wouldn t be as much,2
154000.0,it would be smart because barker colors atract heat and absorb,3
139544.0,in order to keep the car nice and cool while it sits in the sun using a light color would be the best choice because light colors tend to absorb less heat and reflect all wavelengths of light,4
118352.0,the reason i choose the light colored paint and fabric rather then dark colored paint and fabric is because dark colors absorb more heat then light colors while light colors reflect more heat then dark colors,4
153837.0,i would want lighter colored paint and fabric because darker colors will absorb the heat and lighter colors will reflect the heat instead of absorbing it,4
118538.0,the light color fabric reflects the sun from getting hot,3
136505.0,i chose a and c because since white has a low albedo the white reflects off the sun and there will be not a lot of heat in the car where as black has a high albedo and would attract the sun therefore making the car hotter,2
118308.0,using a light colored paint will reflect more sun and a dark colored paint will absorb more sun and a light colored fabric will reflect and a dark colored fabric will absorb,4
139507.0,darker colors especially black absorb heat heat while lighter colors like white reflect heat so in an effort to try and keep the car cool while it sits in the sun laura should aim to use a light colored car with a light fabric interior,4
118320.0,i chose this because the paint doesn t matter about the heat inside the car if she uses dark colored fabric the sun will reflect on it then it will be very hot so if she uses light colored fabric it will stay a little cool in her car,2
151179.0,if she uses a darker color like black than the heat will be lured to the car heating it up more,2
139863.0,by using light colors it would reflect and absorb less heat rather than a darker color since a color such as black absorbs heat more than reflecting,4
139479.0,lighter colored material absorbs less light compared to darker colored materials,4
118400.0,i think the outside and inside of the car should be light colored because the dark colors really absorb a lot of solar energy and light colors do not,4
136399.0,the lighter color will not absorb as much sun radiation then the black color,4
136494.0,i chose the light colored paint and fabric because light colors like white reflect the light,3
139489.0,using a light colored fabric on the inside of the car and a light colored paint on the outside will cause the car to absorb less sunlight so the car will be less hot,4
136362.0,light color will reflect the light so it does not come in to the car and i see people put those inside the car to keep it from getting hot,4
118344.0,i chose a light colored fabric because the light fabric dose not obsorb the sun as much as the dark fabric,3
151223.0,the light paint and fabric will have the heat bounce off instead of being trapped,3
136492.0,i think this because the light colored paint will reflect the light back into the world,4
136504.0,i think it will be a light color outside because i makes the suns radiation reflect and not make the car as hot as a black or darker color if you change what is inside and the outside is dark the car will absorve the heat because its black even if the inside is cool it doesn t mean the outside is to,5
139785.0,light colored paint and fabric will increase the amount of reflectivity which will then be able to reflect a larger amount of solar radiation and make the car more cooler than a car with dark colors,4
136500.0,i chose this because light colors reflect the sunlight while black and dark colors absorb the sun light,5
136359.0,if you have a light colored paint on the outside your car will reflect heat instead of absorbing heat and if you have a light colored fabric inside your car the fabric won t get super hot,3
136387.0,the light colored car and fabrics will reflect most of the rays from the sun resulting as the car being cooler,4
154335.0,dark colers are fast to heat up because they atraked the sun,2
150122.0,i chose light colored paint and fabric because light colored stuff reflects heat instead of absorbing it like dark colored things do,3
136375.0,the color white or any light colord fabric dose not absorb any colors making it cool on the inside of the car,2
153919.0,i chose dark colored paint on the outside because radiation and heat have a harder time getting through darker things,3
118561.0,if she uses light colors she the heat will reflect of the fabric and paint,3
154108.0,i chose using light colored fabric and using a light colored paint because when the sun rays hit the light color it won t absorb as much as it would to a dark colored one for example if its a hot day and you re wearing a light colored shirt such as white it wont be as hot but if you wear a dark colored shirt such as black it will be very hot so when the sun rays go through the car windows it won t absorb the fabric as long as it is a light color,4
136501.0,i think this because light colors reflect heat more than dark colors so the light colored fabric and light colored paint will reflect the heat that would make the car warm hot,3
136685.0,using a light colored fabric and paint will not absorb a lot of light energy,3
118481.0,dark obsorbs heat,3
118567.0,you should use light colored paint and fabric for your car because light colored things reflect heat much more than dark colored things,3
118575.0,lighter colors like white deflect energy but dark colors like black absorbs energy,3
118413.0,the light colered fabric will help because it will reflect the sun where as black sunlight will obsorb the sunlight,5
118488.0,it will work because the dark fabric like black will eat the sunlight thing and light colored fabric like yellow wont,3
150079.0,because then on the inside the ligth colored fabric will reflect the sun not atract the sun,3
118548.0,laura should use light colored fabric on the inside because it wont obsorb heat like if you put dark fabric,3
136515.0,i think laura should use light colored paint and light colored fabric for her car because white reflects and black absorbs,4
136360.0,because that reflects the sun light which has heat,4
154214.0,keeping the whole car light and shiny reflects the sun s rays away from the car,4
154210.0,i chose this because the light colors will reflect and most likely won t absorb any heat,4
