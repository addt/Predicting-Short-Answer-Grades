153852.0,i chose black because it wont reflect and there is going to be no bright light inside the car and white will reflect and will make the sun come towards the car even more,3
136480.0,the reason why because of albedo albedo is for an example if you have a dark color on it gets extremely hot because darker colors absorbs more heat than lighter colors,3
139785.0,light colored paint and fabric will increase the amount of reflectivity which will then be able to reflect a larger amount of solar radiation and make the car more cooler than a car with dark colors,4
150230.0,my choice is keep the car light colored because heat reflects off light,3
154135.0,because it will stop the heat longer because it is thicker than the white color fabric so it will reflect,2
149960.0,the light color stuff reflects hot air away,3
150101.0,i chose using light colored fabric inside of the car because dark colored fabric is attracting heat but she doesn t want the car to be hot so the light colored fabric would deflect the heat from going inside the car,3
139882.0,using light colored fabric on the inside of the car will help keep the car cool because it doesn t absorb as much heat as dark colored fabric does,3
139863.0,using a dark color such as black will absorb more heat rather than using a lighter color which will reflect the heat,4
139768.0,the light colors makes the sunlight bounce off the car rather than absorbing it,5
136558.0,because dark colors make it hotter and light colors are less absorbent,2
136455.0,white and softer colored cars would be laura s best choices of staying cool because whiter shades reflect light while black absorbs it making summer days in the car almost unbearably hot inside,5
136498.0,well if you use light colored fabric or paint the heat will reflect off the colors of heat if you use dark colored fabric and paint the the heat will store the energy from the sun which will make the car hot,5
118539.0,tis reflects the light outwards,3
118510.0,dark colors hold more heat so if you use light colors the heat wont get absorbed as much,3
139871.0,lighter colored fabric on the inside of the car helps it to contract and if using dark colors the heat absorbs,4
139795.0,because using a dark colored paint or dark colored fabric can make the car hotter because dark colors absorb more energy or heat,4
139826.0,light colored paint reflects light waves being emitted from the sun so it will not absorb the sun s heat dark colors actually absorb heat therefore if the car were to be painted dark it would absorb the sun s heat and warm up,5
139521.0,light colored paint reflect most of the electromagnetic waves which mean it absorb less radiation from the sun this mean it absorb less heat,5
118341.0,using light colored paints and fabrics reflect the heat off of them instead of absorbing the heat like dark colors,4
139494.0,we would use light color on the outside because it would reflect it out instead of absorbing it and the dark color inside would trap the temperature,4
150133.0,if you use light color fabric on the inside it will get less hot because dark colors attract sun light,3
149956.0,light colors will not really get that hot compared to dark colors like black the sun will reflect off the black car making it hot with light colors the sun wont reflect off the car with light colors making it not as hot,2
136499.0,i say that laura should use a light colored paint on the outside because if the color of the car on the outside is light than the sun will reflect that the color such as white on the inside if the color of the fabric on the inside is dark it will absorb all the heat on the in side of the car,4
136391.0,i chose light color fabric because the darker the fabric like black the light can not reflect making it hot,4
150079.0,because then on the inside the ligth colored fabric will reflect the sun not atract the sun,3
118457.0,the light colored fabric would make solar radiation bounce off the fabric so the car will not get that hot,4
139809.0,if the colors are lighter than light will reflect and be less likely to be absorbed as heat,5
150245.0,i chose this because the lighter the paint the less heat it will absorb,3
136356.0,if you were to use paint to protect your car from the sun it wouldn t work because it doesn t really do anything besides reflecting the colors i would pick a light colored fabric to put around my car because it can act like a shade or like your under a tree also i would pick a light colored one not a dark colored one because the dark one is the closest to black and black absorbs the heat which would make the car hot,3
139543.0,this is because since white absorbs the least amount of heat the outside color would still make a difference but the inside is what really matters because the air is trapped inside with no opening,3
136493.0,dark colors absorb heat so her car would get hotter but light colors reflect heat so if she uses light colors her car will be cooler,4
136571.0,light colered things reflect most light,4
136456.0,since lighter colors have a high albedo the ability to reflect light the car would reflect the heat with lighter color fabric and paint,4
139524.0,light colors will reflect heat whereas darker colors will reflect it,3
136454.0,using a light color like white reflects the sun s heat from coming in to the car and becoming too hot,2
154153.0,so the sun light will reflect,4
139510.0,light colored items tend to reflect light more than dark colored objects which absorbs heat,5
136394.0,i picked light colored paint because it would reflect more light and absorb less light then black,4
118355.0,the heat reflects the light,3
136551.0,well when you have a lighter or white car the light reflects off of the white and plus she should put those aluminum covers,4
118338.0,usually dark colors attract the sun and light colors usually reflect off the sun so if you get or have a light colored car it will reflect off of the sun and will not attract the heat,3
136459.0,if your car isn t black it won t attract heat from the inside or outside of the car because the sun won t even want to look or point towards it if it isn t black or any dark color depending on the type of radiation that gets put down,2
139544.0,in order to keep the car nice and cool while it sits in the sun using a light color would be the best choice because light colors tend to absorb less heat and reflect all wavelengths of light,4
141559.0,well i think it should be dark inside and light inside because if light colors reflect heat most of it will deflect and if some heat does come in then the black can oxorb it and not deflect it all throu the car,4
150143.0,sun shines on dark colored thing but reflects off light colored things,3
150200.0,i chose this because bright colors reflect the heat away,3
139524.0,light colored fabrics reflect more light rays than darker colors which absorbs the suns rays,5
139523.0,i think light color fabric will help reflect some of the sun s radiation which will cool down the car or prevent it from getting hotter due to all the heat from the sun not being reflected,4
139836.0,using dark colors will heat up your cars faster than the lighter colored paints or fabric because dark colors absorbs more heat rather than reflecting it using a lighter color would reflect most of the heat because it does not need to absorbs the colors of the sun as much as the darker colo ones,4
136363.0,because the light colored paint would deflect some of the heat and the light colored fabric would help deflect some more,3
118440.0,you should use light colors on and in the car because the sun aborbs the the dark colors such as black if you have light colors the car will not get as hot that is why when you make solar ovens you use black paper,3
139497.0,lighter colors reflect sun rays while darker colors absorb them it would be wise for laura to use a light colored fabric on the inside and get a car than has a lighter shade in order to reflect sunlight,5
154308.0,i know that darker a color the more light it will absorb and heat so if you have the light color car youre not going to absorb that much heat,4
136363.0,because if it s darker the fabric will absorb the light but if it s lighter it will deflect it,5
136411.0,if you use a light color everything inside and out you are hoping that the heat will reflect and not absorb the light and heat,4
139510.0,light colored items do not absorb heat as easily has darker colored objects it reflects light,5
139501.0,light colored things reflect and does not absorb much heat but dark colored things absorb more heat so if you were to cool off a car you would use something light and not dark in color basically you would use something that would not absorb the heat but reflect the heat,4
151199.0,using light colored paint because dark colors absorb heat but if it is lihgt it wont abosorb,3
154195.0,first of all dark colors attract sunlight so the and answers would not work secondly light colors repel heat energy the answer must be or i think it is one because that would allow the heat to not enter in the first place if the dark colored paint on the outside attract the heat by the time it wants to escape because of the light seats it would already be trapped,3
118413.0,the light colered fabric will help because it will reflect the sun where as black sunlight will obsorb the sunlight,5
139811.0,light colors tend to reflect the suns rays more than dark fabric,4
140712.0,light is more attracted to darker colored paint than light the car will still get hot but it won t be as hot than if laura painted the car with a darker color,2
136451.0,if it is a light colered paint it will reflect the paint and if there is also a light colerad fabricant it will also reflect the solar heat,3
150128.0,light colors reflect heat so the car would stay cooler on the inside because it would reflect the suns rays,4
118438.0,you shouldn t use anything dark because black absorbs sun if you painted your car light it would still be hot due to the material of the car the best thing to do is put a light colored fabric over the car,3
139542.0,light colors reflect light and absorb less heat a car with a light color all around would be cooler than a black colored car,5
136499.0,she should use us light colored paint on the outside and a dark colored fabric on the inside the light colored paint wil reflect the sun s light and the dark colored fabric will absorb the heat on the inside of the car,4
118345.0,this is right because this paint will reflect the heat,2
118513.0,using light colored paint and fabric wont absorb heat as will using dark colored paint,3
136398.0,i picked these choices because dark colors like black are known to absorb heat light colors like white are known to reflect light this explains my choices,5
118368.0,use a light colored fabric to reflect all the heat back at the sun,3
139815.0,using lighter colors will not absorb as much radiation and heat as the darker colors would for an example black cars usually are hotter to touch then white,4
118601.0,she should use a light colored paint because it will reflect all the heat off the car,3
118555.0,using a dark color paint toward the inside of the car will make it cooler because the sun will reflect back on it and it will just bounce back up and it will make the car cooler,2
118585.0,using light fabric on the inside of the car helpes reflect the suns light back into the sun,4
136505.0,these are important because using light fabric and a light paint will make the car reflect sunlight which is reflecting some of the heat that may have gone into the car to make it warmer this is because white has a low albedo and reflect light but if you were to use black materials the car would get hotter beucase it absorbs light and gets hotter,5
154127.0,i chose light paint because darker colors absorb heat better than light colors and that means the paint won t absorb a lot of heat and energy therefore keeping it cool,4
150924.0,it will block the sunlight from going in the car,3
118456.0,i picked light colored paint and fabric because the sun reflects off of light colors and darker colors attract the heat,3
139834.0,that way the light is reflected off the car rather than absorbing it like a dark colored car would,4
136574.0,i think this is the best option because light colors are more related to white which reflects the light and dark colors are related to black which absorbs light,5
136388.0,light colors reflect most the color light for example a white car reflects all the light colors the car stays cool because it reflect all the light that came from the sun the sun is hot which makes me think the colors are hot when they aren t reflected or at anytime,2
154325.0,using black fabric and paint will make the car hotter the color will absorb heat quicker if it is a dark color because it is dark and dark colors don t deflect heat as well as light colors do light colors will deflect heat more because of their brightness,4
118465.0,light colors have very high reflectivity so they wouldn t absorb as much solar radiation,5
118604.0,dark colors absorb heat where as lighter colors reflect heat,3
154371.0,just couse,1
136564.0,using almost anything light colored helps because light colors have a high albedo so the light reflects and goes somewhere else besides the car dark colors have low albedos and so the heat would be absorbed making the car hotter,5
139842.0,because when the sun goes through the glass car the fabric inside the car will reflect out of the car,3
118616.0,i choice light colored fabric because the fabric will help the sun from reflecting heat into the car,2
139513.0,using a light colored fabric on the inside of the car will absorb less heat than that off a darker colored,3
118521.0,the fabric will reflect the light and heat away from the car to keep it cool and same with the paint i would use a light fabric over the car,4
139828.0,we would use light color on the outside because it would reflect it out instead of absorbing it and the dark color inside would trap the temperature inside,4
149963.0,i chose those two answers because anything with a light color like white reflects of the heat from the sun so it doesn t get as hot as dark colored things,4
150900.0,so it reflects off of the car,3
139522.0,since dark colors absorb heat it would be best to use a light colored fabric in addition using fabric can help block the sunlight,3
118296.0,dark colors obsord heat and light colors don t obsorb as much heat,3
136374.0,these heat sources will reflect most of the heat keeping her car cool,2
150204.0,the darker the color the more heat it takes in,2
139822.0,light colors do not absorb light as much as dark colors do,4
136390.0,i had chosen the third one to use light colored fabric and light colored paint because when you use light colored fabric it cools down the car and makes it cooler inside so you will be cooler when you use light colored paint on the outside of your car it wouldn t stay hot on the outside of the car,2
151195.0,light colors reflect heat so if heat dose hit her car it will reflect onto another car or back at the sun,3
118557.0,by using light colored paint on the outside it will reflect off more heat than a dark colored paint that will just absorb the heat by using a light colored fabric on the inside of the car it will also reflect off more heat than a dark colored fabric would,4
118349.0,light colors don t radiate as much heat as dark cars do,2
118550.0,using a dark color like black will absorb the heat to make laura s car more hot using a light color like gold will repel the heat,3
118583.0,because when you sit down your legs will not get burnt and light colors dont absorb that much heat,3
139816.0,light colors do not attract light energy heat as well as dark colors do so the light colored options are better for keeping the car cooler,2
136576.0,i think this will help keep her car cool because if she were to have dark colors it would heat up faster because black absorbs all colors of heat but if she were to paint it white or some other light color it will reflect the sun or absorb tiny bits of thus causing her car to be cool,4
136451.0,because if you put a darker color paint on the car it will absorb the solar energy why as the light color on the outside will reflect the solar energy,5
118315.0,because when making a solar oven my partner and i used dark colors but if you want to cool down your car you should use light colors so it reflects light so that way laura can keep your car from getting to hot,4
136570.0,light colors reflect ultraviolet if you have your car painted a light color like white then it will reflect ultraviolet waves therefore keeping it cool having light colored fabric will also help keep it cool,3
118538.0,the light fabric reflects the sun and heat from going inside the car,3
153823.0,light colored fabric because the lighter the color the less energy it will absorb meaning it won t get as hot,4
150172.0,i chose light colors cause dark colors absorb heat,3
136492.0,i think this because the light colored paint will reflect the light back into the world,4
139833.0,light colors do not absorb as much heat as dark fabrics so if you use a light colored paint and a light color interior the car will not trap as much heat inside as a dark colored combination,3
141559.0,well sins the albedo is high reflectivity the sun will reflect on the in side and the out side causeing it to be cooler than hotter,3
139836.0,using dark colors will heat up your cars faster than the lighter colored paints or fabric because dark colors absorbs more heat rather than reflecting it using a lighter color would reflect most of the heat because it does not need to absorbs the colors of the sun as much as the darker colored ones,4
136460.0,if it s really hot outside the sun is going to be beating down on laura s car the white paint will reflect the heat to help not enter the car the light colored seats will also help reflect the heat in case her windows are not reflective the seats can reflect hat back outside the car,3
136351.0,i is useful to use bright colors on the inside and outside of the car because they will reflect off the color but if it was dark the color would absorb the heat and it would go anywhere causing the car to get hotter,4
118461.0,the darker the color the more heat it attracts and so if the fabric and paint is light colors there will be less heat in the car,2
150215.0,if you have bright coler car it will reflect,3
118400.0,i think the outside and inside of the car should be light colored because the dark colors really absorb a lot of solar energy and light colors do not,4
136425.0,laura should use light colors because it doesn t absorb heat it reflects it if she were to use black it would absorb heat and it would be hot,4
136489.0,well if the inside and outside of her car was a darker color the heat would all be absorbed into the seats making it hot if the inside and outside of the car was a lighter color all the heat would reflect off of it instead,4
118357.0,because a back colored paint or fabric will absorb the heat,3
136453.0,i chose a and c because lighter colors reflect light meanwhile darker colors absorb light creating heat heating up the car,5
118339.0,dark colors draw heat to them so lighter colors are better,2
139544.0,using light colored paint and fabric outside the car inside allows heat to be reflected rather than it being absorbed,4
136405.0,i chose this because the dark paint would take in the sun s heat and the car would get hot with the lighter paint it will reflect more heat than absorb it this same things goes for the fabric,2
154194.0,the dark color paint will absorb most of the energy will the fabric will reflect more energy out of the car making it as cool as posible,5
136567.0,i chose this because the the dark stuff will absorbs all the heat,3
136387.0,light colors reflects light and results as something as being cooler or less hot if you have dark colors they will obsorb rayes from the sun resulting as the car being hot,5
136504.0,i think that she should get both the fabric and the paint because white is going to reflect the light and not make the car as hot as all black,4
136557.0,light reflects color but also some heat black absorbs all colors and absorbs heat fabric traps heat and it becomes very hot,4
136490.0,white and lighter colors reflect the light and does not heat up black and darker colors absorb almost all of the light that is hitting the car,5
139747.0,i think that using a light colored paint on the outside of the car will prevent the car getting hotter because the lighter the color will be the the shinier it is to bounce sun rays back to the atmosphere,4
118561.0,for example if the car is painted white on the outside the heat will bounce off it and if the fabric is white on the inside it won t absorb it,2
139856.0,dark color fabric on the inside and dark color paint absorbs heat so it would be best to use light color fabric and paint,3
118351.0,light colors reflect heat so she should get many light objects in her car,3
136457.0,light colored items have higher albedo so it can reflect sunlight better than dark colored item which have low albedo the lower the albedo it s more likely to absorb the sunlight and gain heat,5
150089.0,i chose a and c because they both represent light colors i know that light colors reflect the sun and dark colors obsorb the sun,4
136491.0,the light colored things will reflect the light and give off less heat,4
136513.0,because we ve learned that darker colors absorb heat and lighter colors reflect heat,4
136463.0,i chose light everything because they don t attract heat they reflect it,3
136481.0,the white paint will reflect the sun rays away from the car,4
154109.0,i choice light color for the inside fabric and the outside paint because if you use light color it will reflect the sun but if you use dark colors it will absorb the sun,4
118589.0,dark colors like black attract sunlight so light colored interior and paint on the outside will prevent that,3
140093.0,if you have a dark colored car than your car is more likely to be warmer when you leave your car out in the sun instead of a lighter colored car because the darker colored cars observe more sun energy,4
136368.0,the light colors will reflect the heat outside of the car to make it colder when it reflects the heat will not stay inside the car,3
136379.0,the lighter the it reflects light which makes heat go down,3
154211.0,i chose both lights because dark s absorb heat and lights reflect heat,4
139739.0,these arre important because if the color is lighter then it reflects the sun a lot better and doesn t absorb as much heat as the darker colors,4
150128.0,since light colors reflect heat it would be important to have light colored elements in the car,3
