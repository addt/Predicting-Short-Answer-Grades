118366.0,light colors reflect light,3
154107.0,doing a light colored paint on the outside and inside because dark colors attracts heat while light color reflects heat,3
136501.0,i think this because light colors reflect heat more than dark colors so the light colored fabric and light colored paint will reflect the heat that would make the car warm hot,3
136456.0,if she uses light colored fabric on the outside of her car the fabric will reflect the heat from the light keeping the car cool,3
118560.0,when you put dark colored fabric the sun reflects dark colored fabric,2
118366.0,the light cover will reflect the solar radiation,4
118619.0,light color don t absorb as much heat as darker color do so if her car has lighter colored car it won t won t get as hot as a darker colored car,3
154128.0,light is attracted to dark colors so by using light colors your car will not be as open to the radiation,3
118579.0,it will because it reflects light and heat,3
118561.0,for example if the car is painted white on the outside the heat will bounce off it and if the fabric is white on the inside it won t absorb it,2
139480.0,a light colored paint will allow for less radiation to be absorbed by the sun making the car feel cool even though it has been in the sun,4
150200.0,i chose those because when the color is light it reflects,3
154194.0,i chose this answer because the dark color paint will only make the metal hot on the outside when you have light color fabric on the inside the energy will come in through the glass but the fabric will not absorb as much energy as the dark fabric or paint and the energy would just bounce out of the car,5
136417.0,light colors are better because it will reflect the brightness of it,3
118356.0,the light colors reflect heat and light but when dark colors absorb heat and light,5
136393.0,if you have lighter colors the less light will be absorbed making it cooler inside the car,3
118446.0,light colored interiors and exteriors are important because darker colors absorb heat and lighter colors reflect it,4
139855.0,darker objects or colors absorbs more heat so the more light the object absorbs lighter colors reflects heat,5
136423.0,light color on the outside would reflect the radition off the car the dark color on the insade would make the heat stay in the fabric,4
139834.0,this means it reflects a lot of the light that hits it rather than absorb it,4
139506.0,the light colored fabric reflects the sunlight and prevents light from entering,4
150075.0,when using a light color the heat reflects off it but when using a dark color it absorbs the heat,4
118355.0,the heat reflects the light,3
150242.0,the bright colors reflect heat while dark ones absorb more heat,4
118352.0,a dark color such as black can absorb heat much faster while a light color doesn t absorb much heat faster but slower,3
154325.0,using black fabric and paint will make the car hotter the color will absorb heat quicker if it is a dark color because it is dark and dark colors don t deflect heat as well as light colors do light colors will deflect heat more because of their brightness,4
139870.0,with a lighter color like white the sun reflects its heat away more efficiently than with a darker color like black which absorbs heat,2
118585.0,because it will reflect the light back into the sun,2
118607.0,dark colors absorbs more light and heat than lighter colors which reflect light and heat more since lighter colors reflect heat and light more using lighter colors will keep her car cool,5
139747.0,i think that using a light colored paint on the outside of the car will prevent the car getting hotter because the lighter the color will be the the shinier it is to bounce sun rays back to the atmosphere,4
150648.0,using light colored things will not absorb the heat like dark colored things,4
139816.0,light colors do not attract light energy heat as well as dark colors do so the light colored options are better for keeping the car cooler,2
153916.0,lighter colors reflect heat and don t absorb heat,4
139495.0,because light colored fabric does not absorb light and reflects it,4
153860.0,i chose this because if it is a light color it won t attract the sunlight as much as a dark,3
154210.0,i chose this because the light colors will reflect and most likely won t absorb any heat,4
118539.0,tis reflects the light outwards,3
139822.0,light colors do not absorb light as much as dark colors do,4
150921.0,black absorbs all light and turns it into heat but white does not,5
118454.0,lighter colors reflect the sun away,3
153922.0,white things reflect the sun back up,3
136455.0,white light colors reflect light so black and dark shades would be a dangerous choice if you want to not be hot in the summer sun,4
118345.0,this is right because this paint will reflect the heat,2
150144.0,dark conducts heat light doesn t conduct heat,3
139795.0,because using a dark colored paint or dark colored fabric can make the car hotter because dark colors absorb more energy or heat,4
118608.0,the most important laura needs to do to keep her ca from the summer sun is to use light paint light paint because it wont absorbed the heat and so the car doesn t get hot she should also use light colored fabric inside the car so the car inside is not hot,3
150248.0,i picked this because then it won t reflect that much,3
150094.0,dark colers conduct heat,3
150054.0,light colored objects can reflect the light or keep it from getting warm,4
136500.0,i chose this because light colors reflect the sunlight while black and dark colors absorb the sun light,5
139506.0,since we are talking about the inside of the car we don t want to know about the outside material since using a light fabric is best because it reflects the most light and it also doesn t let the air particles heat up,4
149963.0,i chose those two answers because anything with a light color like white reflects of the heat from the sun so it doesn t get as hot as dark colored things,4
139826.0,light colored paint reflects light waves being emitted from the sun so it will not absorb the sun s heat dark colors actually absorb heat therefore if the car were to be painted dark it would absorb the sun s heat and warm up,5
136493.0,colors such as white and light colors light this reflects heat while colors such as black and dark colors absorb it,4
153843.0,dark atracts more sun light because dark atracts more sun light,3
136518.0,i think laura should use a light colored paint on the inside and outside of the car because light colors reflect heat and dark colors absorb heat if laura uses both light colors her car will reflect all the heat but if she uses dark colors her car will absorb all the heat,4
118439.0,dark attracts heat and light color reflects,3
118460.0,using a light colored fabric on the inside because if you put a dark colored one it can attract sunlight,3
118585.0,using light fabric on the inside of the car helpes reflect the suns light back into the sun,4
118514.0,dark colors attract more sunlight which makes it so that your car absorbs more sunlight than the cars next to you the more sunlight that your car absorbs the hotter the interior will get,4
136481.0,since dark colours like black navy blue and ect make things hotter by attracting heat people can change that by using light colours to reflect heat,2
136571.0,light colered things reflect most light,4
118525.0,light color would keep the car cooler because darkness absorbs more sunlight,4
136485.0,because if it s light colored it might basically not get your car to hot and might reflect back to the sun because of the light color,3
139488.0,dark colored fabric absorbs heat while light colored fabric reflects heat,4
139830.0,black cars tend to attract more sunlight and rise in temperature on the inside and outside of the car so switching to a lighter colored paint would make this not possible,2
136469.0,i think that using light colored fabric will help because it reflects heat and other colors using dark colored fabric would just aborbed the heat making it hotter,4
136388.0,light colors make the inside of the car cooler because the sun color lights are being reflected not absorbed it s like a sponge a sponge soaks up a lot of water and gets bigger and they mostly have color in a car the darker the color the more heat that is in the car,3
153912.0,dark colors get hotter than lighter colors dark colors attract radiation and lighter colors don t,3
136580.0,i think that the options that i chose are correct because if your car was dark color the dark color would absorb all of the heat but if the car was a light color it would reflect the heat,4
136412.0,the lighter color your car has the less color it obsorbs and the less color the car obsorbs the less heat it has,2
136352.0,the lighter the color the more light and heat gets reflected dark colors absorb more heat,4
136390.0,i think that she should use the light colored paint one the outside and the light colored fabric on the inside because dark colors absorb colors heat and light and the light colors reflect the light and heat,4
136457.0,light colored items have higher albedo so it can reflect sunlight better than dark colored item which have low albedo the lower the albedo it s more likely to absorb the sunlight and gain heat,5
139533.0,lighter colors reflect heat while darker colors absorb the heat and make the inside of the car hotter,4
139507.0,if laura wants to keep her car cool while it sits in the sun then it is best to avoid getting a car that has dark colors both inside and out dark colors like black absorb a lot more heat than lighter colors so that means if the car is dark inside and out it will get a lot warmer than a car than is lighter in color,3
139482.0,a light colored paint job would reflect the sunlight meaning the car would not absorb the heat,5
136395.0,light colors absorb less heat than dark colors therefore having ligher colors will help keep your car cooler,4
118465.0,light colors have very high reflectivity so they wouldn t absorb as much solar radiation,5
153909.0,light colors in general reflect the suns radiation back to the sun but dark colors do the opposite they attract heat that s why she need a light color paint and cloth rather then a dark paint and cloth,4
136367.0,i think that laura should by a light painted car and a light colored fabric because if you have a dark colored car the suns light will absorb the heat causing the inside to be warmer but if you use a light colored car the suns light will reflect the heat and the car wouldn t be so hot,5
139477.0,the light color paint and fabric will not absorb as much light as a dark color fabric,4
139769.0,dark colors absorb heat more than light colors using light colors will help reflect the light away from the car and the heat,5
136561.0,darker colors absorb more of the light spectrum and lighter reflects almost all of the light spectrum,5
118418.0,light colors would make it a little cooler because when you where something dark it absorbs more light,4
154126.0,i choose my answer because the dark fabric will shade out the sunlight,3
136476.0,i chose using a light colored paint on the outside of the car because light paint will reflect the sun as the dark paint will absorb the heat i also chose use light colored fabric on the inside of the car because of the same thing,4
153863.0,because if the outside was darker reflecting up it will get heat to no come in and if you use light color fabric in the inside it wont attract the sun light,3
118344.0,i chose the light covered fabric because dack stuff absorb the light and heat it up more,4
139481.0,when using a light colored paint and fabric it would mean that these colors would not absorb much of sun light rather than using a darker color such as black,4
151188.0,i think this because when i wear a black shirt all the heat soaks in and im hot so i know that laura should do a light colored paint so that way if she does do a dark color then it will be soaked in heat,3
139806.0,i suggest to use a light colored paint on the outside because light colors usually absorb less heat than the dark colors and i also suggest that use light colored fabric on the inside of the car is because fabric is a good insulator because the fabric has little fibers in it to keep the cool air in which means that the fabric is strong,3
150143.0,sun shines on dark colored thing but reflects off light colored things,3
151224.0,light colors such as white bounce or reflect sunlight some heat stays but it will not be as hot as where she uses black which absorbs heat,5
139812.0,the lighter fabric reflects the sun from hitting the car so basically it blocks heat from being moved into the car,3
118391.0,the light colored fabric will deflect the sun s rays from getting inside while the dark colored fabric will absorb the sun s rays and let it in the car,4
136359.0,it will help her because if she has a light colored car it will reflect heat but if she has a dark colored car it will absorb heat,4
150241.0,i chose to have a light color on the inside and a dark color on the outside because when you have a light color on the inside it will reflect the heat from the inside back to the outside,3
139834.0,that way the light is reflected off the car rather than absorbing it like a dark colored car would,4
149971.0,lololo,1
139526.0,to keep her car cool laura should use a light colored fabric because it won t absorb as much heat and reflect the light rays coming from the sun,4
118462.0,a dark color will obsorb the heat and the light color will reflect the heat there for you have a light color everything,4
118522.0,having a light color car will allow it not to obsorbe heat same thing with the inside it will get hot,3
118320.0,i chose this because the paint doesn t matter about the heat inside the car if she uses dark colored fabric the sun will reflect on it then it will be very hot so if she uses light colored fabric it will stay a little cool in her car,2
136411.0,if you use a light color everything inside and out you are hoping that the heat will reflect and not absorb the light and heat,4
139511.0,choosing a light color paint will help reflect some of that ultraviolet radiation from the sun because if you have a dark colored car the darker color will absorb a lot of the heat from the sun increasing the temperature paint color is a important factor for the temperature on the inside and outside of your car so chose a light colored paint for your car if you live in a warm place also depending on where you live will affect what paint type you want,2
150174.0,the light paint will deflect the heat,3
118488.0,dark fabric obsorbs the sun and light fabric doesnt,3
139538.0,darker colors absorb light more so than light colors so having a light colored paint on the outside will absorb less of the sunlight,4
118589.0,dark colors like black attract sunlight so light colored interior and paint on the outside will prevent that,3
136418.0,i think she should use this because it can keep her car colder and not so hot because its a light color and the sun bounces off light colors so if laura wants to keep her car cool that is what she needs,3
139866.0,darker colors will absorb heat so if there is a lighter color fabric inside it will cool down faster,3
139775.0,because dark colors absorb laura should use a light colored paint on the outside so that it heat doesn t go into the car,3
136456.0,since lighter colors have a high albedo the ability to reflect light the car would reflect the heat with lighter color fabric and paint,4
139534.0,using light color would keep the car cool because light colors don t absorb light energy very well they reflect it,5
136494.0,i said using a light colored paint on the outside of the car because then the car will reflect the light from going inside the car,4
150148.0,i choose light things because the sun just beams off of light clothes dark clothes soak up all the heat,4
150202.0,using light colors will not absorb the heat,4
150917.0,the sun s radiation is attracted to darker colors the car would get hotter if it had dark colors the car will still get hot with light colors but if you had darker colors the car would be really hot,3
150056.0,the color black absorbs heat and gets hotter quicker and the color white takes longer to get hotter,3
136564.0,using almost anything light colored helps because light colors have a high albedo so the light reflects and goes somewhere else besides the car dark colors have low albedos and so the heat would be absorbed making the car hotter,5
139865.0,the dark color paint would reflect some of the light out back towards the atmosphere the light colored fabric would reflect some of the light off inside the car,3
136461.0,the light is being reflected by the light colored things in the car and around it sending the light into the air making it hotter not the car,3
154314.0,if the paint and fabric of the car were black it would not be able to reflect paint away so light colored paint and fabric is good,3
150219.0,laura will want a light colored car because then it will not absorb heat it will reflect it,4
136481.0,the white paint will reflect the sun rays away from the car,4
136571.0,becasue dark things and black things all absorb light while light colored things reflect light,5
139510.0,light colored items do not absorb heat as easily has darker colored objects it reflects light,5
150059.0,it will help heat reflect off,3
153824.0,i chose this because if the car color was dark like black or dark red it would naturally take in more solar radiation if it is light colored less solar radiation would be absorbed making the atmosphere colder,4
136483.0,i chose the light colors because they will reflect the heat instead of absorbing it like the dark colors would do,4
139806.0,i think the dark color paint would absorb more heat for the sunlight,4
136360.0,because that reflects the sun light which has heat,4
118438.0,you shouldn t use anything dark because black absorbs sun if you painted your car light it would still be hot due to the material of the car the best thing to do is put a light colored fabric over the car,3
136483.0,i chose these answers because light colors such as white reflects light and keeps the car cooler then it would if you use dark colored things on your car,4
136379.0,using a light color fabric means it reflect light so it doesn t get hot,4
139536.0,light colored paint and fabric reflect radiation more than dark colored paint and fabric the less radiation is absorbed the less heat will be inside of the car,4
150148.0,light colors reflect the heat off of things while dark colors absorb the heat,4
118444.0,the light colored fabric will partially reflect the heat away from the car,3
139643.0,light color absorbs less heat thus the car will be cooler,3
118483.0,using light colored fabric is good because light colored fabric reflects heat,3
154846.0,laura should use light colored fabric for the inside and the outside of the car because light colors don t absorb heat as much as dark colors do,3
154340.0,i chose that one because its like tin foil so it just reflect of,3
139826.0,light colored objects reflect white light therefore if laura used light colored objects then the sun s rays would be reflected off the car and the car would not absorb heat,4
153839.0,if you have a dark color on he inside and outside of our car it will attract the car and absorb the heat,3
139508.0,the sun s rays provide heat energy through radiation using the same principles as light since these are electromagnetic waves we know that the light will be able to penetrate through the car especially on the windows because they are made of glass and are transparent allowing the light to go through light colors reflect light whereas dark colors absorb light meaning that the light colors are reflecting heat energy from the electromagnetic waves and the dark colors are absorbing them making the interior hotter through conduction the light colors in the inside of the car will help keep the car cool because it provides another layer of protection in a way where the fabric can help reflect the light that is able to penetrate through the car s exterior,5
154208.0,dark colors would not let in as much solar radiation as lighter colors would because it would be harder for solar energy to pass through dark colors,3
154319.0,i beleive this because darker colered things absorb more radiation from the sun and i know that becuse i have read it in science articles and been told off my brother went to osu,4
139839.0,light colors will bounce off the car which means it wont be absorbing as much energy so it wont be as hot,5
149960.0,the light color stuff reflects hot air away,3
136362.0,the light color on the outside will reflect the heat the darker the object the warmer it is if the light is on the outside it will reflect outside so it will not reach inside the car,3
139514.0,more of the sun s energy would be reflected so less light energy would be absorbed,5
118401.0,light colors don t obsorb as much light as the dark colors,4
136404.0,i belive painting the car a light color and having light colored fabric inside the car reduces heat because white or a light color reflects all light and solar energy so laura s car can stay cooler,4
118582.0,so the sun can reflect of the light sun pannel,2
149972.0,light colored paint will prevent most heat form entering the car because it s reflective dark colored fabric on the inside will let the heat escape more easily than light colored fabric,3
139513.0,using a light colored fabric on the inside of the car will absorb less heat than that off a darker colored,3
136413.0,she wouldn t want the inside of her car to get hot so she would put light colored fabric inside and it would not absorb it,2
153816.0,using a light colored fabric or paint would be coolest because darker colors absorb solar radiation,4
