136352.0,the lighter the color the more light and heat gets reflected dark colors absorb more heat,4
118531.0,i think you should use a light color because dark attracts the sun and light colors deflect the sun therefor it will be cooler inside because there are more lighter colors than dark colors,2
136454.0,if you use a light color fabric its will reflect all the heat that try s to come in the car,3
150174.0,the light paint will deflect the heat,3
150228.0,the light colored paint reflects the suns reflection,3
118444.0,the light color of the car will deflect some of the suns rays and any other heat that manages to get in will be reflected by the light colored seats,3
154138.0,because if it is dark it heats up faster then when it is lighter so that why she needs to have the paint lighter than darker its like if she wore black or any dark color it heats up faster than when she were any light color so the same thing happens to the car,2
118556.0,it should be white because the black things absorb the sun and the white does not do that,3
136382.0,light colors reflect more light than darker colors making the object not absorb as much heat so if she uses light fabrics and paints more heat will be reflected making the car cooler,4
139477.0,the light color paint and fabric will not absorb as much light as a dark color fabric,4
155053.0,her car has to be light because dark colors attract sunlight and she wants to keep her car cool,3
139505.0,a light colored fabric paint reflects more sunlight and the energy that comes along with it,4
150247.0,because the light reflects of light colers,4
139496.0,using any light colored paint or items would help out a lot because light colors like white doesn t absorb much heat from the sun this means that anything with light colors will be cooler on the other hand dark colors like black absorbs all the heat from the sun this means that anything with dark colors will be hotter,2
118590.0,light colored things reflect off the light and dark things absorb light,5
118318.0,to keep the car cool you should have a light colored fabric because it can keep the car cool and the sun cannot heat up the car,2
136512.0,black or other darker colors attract more light than white or other light colors,2
149972.0,having two layers of light colored things will let minimal heat in any heat that gets in won t get absorbed into the car because there is light colored fabric,3
139840.0,light because for dark colors absorbs the primary colors that are present,3
139518.0,the light colored fabric on the inside of a car will keep the car cool while it sits in the sun because the light color fabric doesn t absorb heat light dark colored fabric would,3
118478.0,darker colored cars absorb the suns radiation,4
118401.0,light colors don t obsorb as much light as the dark colors,4
118310.0,i think the car should be painted a light color and not a dark color so the sun is not a tracked to the cars dark paint and it wouldn t bleach the dark color off,2
139855.0,darker objects or colors absorbs more heat so the more light the object absorbs lighter colors reflects heat,5
154193.0,if the inside is white it wont keep the sun in the fabric it has but if its black it will totaly obsorbe the heat like a sponge,3
154126.0,i choose the light colored paint because the dark colored paint attracted light but the light colored paint repels light,3
118560.0,i choose the light colored because if it was dark the sun would reflect dark color,2
136400.0,the bright colors would reflect the sun s heat more and the dark colors would absorb the heat so the car would be warmer,2
150248.0,i picked this because then it won t reflect that much,3
139829.0,both will not absorb as much radiation and will make it cooler than it is outside dark colors absorb more heat and radiation which will not make the car cool,4
139496.0,using any dark colored items fabric or paint will absorb all the heat from the sun and everything will warm up as a result the opposite would be best to keep things cool in the sun,2
118538.0,the light fabric reflects the sun and heat from going inside the car,3
139855.0,she should use a light color because dark colors absorbs more heat than lighter colors they get the most heat light colors reflect heat from the sun which is why light colored clothes help us cool when its hot sunny,2
136368.0,well a light colored paint will reflect the heat from the sun if you put a dark colored paint on the car it would absorb the heat making your car hotter,2
139535.0,darker colors tend to attract more heat from the sun if the outside is a darker color the heat will be attracted to the outside if the interior is light it will absorb less heat and allow the interior to be cooler,2
153916.0,lighter colors reflect heat and don t absorb heat,4
136504.0,i think it will be a light color outside because i makes the suns radiation reflect and not make the car as hot as a black or darker color if you change what is inside and the outside is dark the car will absorve the heat because its black even if the inside is cool it doesn t mean the outside is to,5
136572.0,white will reflect the sun so you wouldn t get that hot the black will absorb the sun so she should chose a light color,4
154846.0,laura should use light colored fabric for the inside and the outside of the car because light colors don t absorb heat as much as dark colors do,3
153839.0,if you have a dark color on he inside and outside of our car it will attract the car and absorb the heat,3
118366.0,the light cover will reflect the solar radiation,4
136481.0,the white paint will reflect the sun rays away from the car,4
136516.0,light colors reflect heat dark colors absorb heat,4
136502.0,i think so because according to albedo heat reflects off of light colored things and dark colors aborcs heat,4
139863.0,using a dark color such as black will absorb more heat rather than using a lighter color which will reflect the heat,4
153831.0,the darker the color the more heat it will absorb if it is lighter it will not get as hot,3
139507.0,darker colors especially black absorb heat heat while lighter colors like white reflect heat so in an effort to try and keep the car cool while it sits in the sun laura should aim to use a light colored car with a light fabric interior,4
139841.0,a lighter color inside the car would mean the inside would be reflecting more sun than its absorbing,3
150899.0,i choose my answer because heat bounces off the light colors instead of dark colors because dark colors absorb heat,5
150915.0,dark colors absorb heat so i assume its the opposite with light colors,3
151176.0,dark colors attract the sunlight,3
154153.0,so the sun light will reflect,4
150648.0,using light colored things will not absorb the heat like dark colored things,4
136506.0,well light colored things reflect color and light while dark colored objects absorb light and color so that says that light colored objects will keep your car cooler,4
136382.0,if she uses a lot of light colors on her car all the solar radiation will be reflected not absorbed making the car cooler if she used dark colors a lot of heat would be absorbed making the car hotter,5
118450.0,i think laura should put light colored paint on her car because if you put dark colored paint on the car for example black paint the burning light heat from the sun would contrast with the dark paint and make the heat super strong if you have light color the sun would not have to contrast as much and the heat wouldn t be as much,2
118601.0,light colors reflect light so a light colored paint might help,3
118540.0,i think you should have a light colored paint on the outside because darker colors attract heat the seats on the inside should be a lighter colors to because dark colors attract heat,2
139529.0,using light color because it doesn t absorb heat more then black color,3
150134.0,light doesn t absorb the heat as much as dark does,4
139536.0,light colored objects tend to reflect more heat and not absorb heat,3
136381.0,i chose using a light colored paint on the outside and a light colored fabric on the inside because light colors reflect the light which makes it cooler and dark colors absorb all the light which makes it hotter,5
136394.0,i think using a light color paint would be better than a dark colored paint because the light color doesn t absorb that much light,4
136423.0,light colored paint on the outside would make the car cooler because light colors deflect the sun s radiation on the inside there should be dark colored fabric becuase then it won t deflect heat onto the inside of the car instead it will soak in the heat,5
136359.0,it will help her because if she has a light colored car it will reflect heat but if she has a dark colored car it will absorb heat,4
118457.0,the light colored fabric would make solar radiation bounce off the fabric so the car will not get that hot,4
118441.0,laura s car should have dark colored paint on the outside because the paint will absorb the heat instead of it heating up the car light colored fabric will reflect heat instead of absorbing it and heating up the car seats,3
136560.0,because it can reflect the sun from the car,3
136492.0,i think she should use a light colored paint outside the car because a lighter color reflects the sun s radiation and bounces off the car,4
118415.0,i chose these answers because light colors like white or sky blue don t attract or absorb much sunlight,3
136389.0,laura wants to make her car cooler on a hot day if she wants to do this the light colored paint and and fabric is what she should use the light colored paint and fabric will have more white in it and the white reflects the sun the heat and solar radiation will not go into the car but it will reflect it away if she used the dark colored paint and fabric it would absorb the solar radiation making the car warmer and that is not what she wants to do,5
153933.0,i think this is the right awnser because people usually put those sun reflecting tin foil colored things on their car window,2
118323.0,i belive light colors atract less sun light and darker colors atract more sunlight,3
153984.0,what i chose is correct because wearing a black or dark shirt or cloths will suck in the heat from the suns solar rays,3
139643.0,darker colors absorb more heat so by using a lighter colored paint and fabric which absorbs less heat this will help keep the car cooler,3
139537.0,light colors can reflect more light which means reflect more radiation that produces heat the more light it reflects the less heat that will reach in the car and the car will be cooler than a car that has a darker color,4
155334.0,because it can reflect the sun light from getting the car hot,4
149961.0,it does not attract sunlight,3
153979.0,a light color will make the sun reflect of the car so it will be a little warm but it will still work,3
153824.0,i chose this because if the car color was dark like black or dark red it would naturally take in more solar radiation if it is light colored less solar radiation would be absorbed making the atmosphere colder,4
136369.0,the lighter the color the more uv it reflects if she painted the inside or out of the car black it would absorb the heat making the car hotter,4
139798.0,since dark attracts the sun having both a light colored paint and fabric would be best for a car,2
139862.0,the darker colored materials paint absorbs heat better than lighter colors,3
150131.0,dark colored fabric is known to contract heat energy if she doesn t want to make her car hot by the end of the summer then she can use all light colored fabric or paint,3
136384.0,if the outside paint is a light color the sun will reflect off of the car before the heat can even get into the car this is why i think laura should go with the light colored paint on the outside,3
118437.0,light keeps the reflects the sun,3
150219.0,i chose to use light colored fabrics and paint because light colors reflect heat whereas darker colors tend to absorb the heat making the temperature hot,4
118320.0,i chose this because the paint doesn t matter about the heat inside the car if she uses dark colored fabric the sun will reflect on it then it will be very hot so if she uses light colored fabric it will stay a little cool in her car,2
139790.0,light colored paint bounces off the heat energy of the sun the dark will absorb it fabric also feels hotter than paint,5
139809.0,if the colors are lighter than light will reflect and be less likely to be absorbed as heat,5
139841.0,light colored fabric would allow for less radiation absorption,4
154371.0,just couse,1
118579.0,it will because it reflects light and heat,3
150170.0,i think she should use a light colored paint because it s not gonna look as bad if it fades over time,2
150098.0,this is because the color black or darker colors attract the sun and the color white or lighter colors reflect the sun,3
118456.0,i picked light colored paint and fabric because the sun reflects off of light colors and darker colors attract the heat,3
118456.0,i picked light colored paint and fabric because light colors reflect off the sun and dark colors attracts the heat,3
136553.0,because lighter colors don t adsorb as much as darker colors so and because lighter colors do the opposite of darker colors they reflect,4
139844.0,light colors on a hot day will make you less hot because dark colors absorb heat,3
136354.0,i chose thoughts because the solar radiation will not get absorbed and it will not get to hot,4
149950.0,because the sun reflects off bright colors,3
136555.0,i feel like dark colors are better at reflecting heat then light colors,2
136490.0,white and lighter colors reflect the light and does not heat up black and darker colors absorb almost all of the light that is hitting the car,5
154134.0,she should have a light colored car with a light colored fabric on the inside because sunlight is attracted to dark colored objects,3
151219.0,using a light color paint means it will not hit the light has much like dark color s,2
150129.0,lighter colers do not atract the sun but darker colers do,2
118600.0,light colors reflect and dark colors colect,3
153923.0,i think she should put a light colored fabric because if you put a dark color like black it will heat up because the sun radiation will go through and with light colors like white it will not,3
139861.0,it will reflect more light and it will not attract as much heat compared to a dark color,2
139856.0,dark color fabric on the inside and dark color paint absorbs heat so it would be best to use light color fabric and paint,3
154118.0,dark colors absorb the sun sunlight,4
139506.0,since we are talking about the inside of the car we don t want to know about the outside material since using a light fabric is best because it reflects the most light and it also doesn t let the air particles heat up,4
118338.0,i picked those choices because light colors usually reflect off the sun and dark colors absorb the sun so if you have a dark color the heat will stay in or on the car but if you use light colors it will knock the hat off of it,4
139497.0,lighter colors reflect light while darker colors absorb light using lighter colors will allow the car to remain the coolest,5
139737.0,light color really does not absorbs the heat not like black it will always feel hot,3
118350.0,use light colors because darker colors attract more heat and sunlight and light colors attract less,3
150061.0,i chose light colored fabric and light colored paint because the heat will bonce off of the car,3
136461.0,the light is being reflected by the light colored things in the car and around it sending the light into the air making it hotter not the car,3
139561.0,dark colored stuff like black absorbs more heat so it s better to use light colored stuff,3
136456.0,since lighter colors have a high albedo the ability to reflect light the car would reflect the heat with lighter color fabric and paint,4
149959.0,because if we used dark colored fabric it will absorb light and make the car hotter,4
136395.0,since white has a high albedo it will reflect most of the sunlight that hitsit therefore the white colors on the car will help keep the car cool because there will be very little heat absorbed,4
139542.0,light colors reflect light and absorb less heat a car with a light color all around would be cooler than a black colored car,5
118443.0,using darkly colored paint and fabric can heat up the car because the heat can be absorbed from the darkly colored fabric or paint,3
118452.0,i think that it is the right choice to put a lighter color paint on the outside because dark colors obsorb the sun,3
150069.0,you would need a light colored car because dark colors attract and absorb heat i know this because my dads car is always outside on the seats are dark colored it is always hot when you get in,3
154308.0,i know that darker a color the more light it will absorb and heat so if you have the light color car youre not going to absorb that much heat,4
151176.0,light colors make the sun reflect off it dark colors attract the sun,3
118339.0,dark colors absorbs heat so light colors are better unless it is cold,3
139544.0,in order to keep the car nice and cool while it sits in the sun using a light color would be the best choice because light colors tend to absorb less heat and reflect all wavelengths of light,4
118523.0,so it wont heat up as fast as darked color one,2
136480.0,because it s like if you wear dark closet you get hot like black closet so for it s the same for cars as well the reason why is because like dark colors has a low albedo and absorbs a lot of light and light colors are the same but it doesn t absorb it reflects,4
136411.0,if you use a light color everything inside and out you are hoping that the heat will reflect and not absorb the light and heat,4
136485.0,i choosed this for my answer because if you use dark fabric it will mostly contain and absorb the heat because when me an my teammates tested our solar oven our black paper was getting hotter when the foil reflected the light to our solar oven,3
150172.0,i chose light colors cause dark colors absorb heat,3
154194.0,i chose this answer because the dark color paint will only make the metal hot on the outside when you have light color fabric on the inside the energy will come in through the glass but the fabric will not absorb as much energy as the dark fabric or paint and the energy would just bounce out of the car,5
136503.0,these two choices reflect light and doesn t absorbs it,3
136561.0,darker colors absorb more of the light spectrum and lighter reflects almost all of the light spectrum,5
150060.0,heat soaks into darker colors,3
118296.0,dark colors obsord heat and light colors don t obsorb as much heat,3
150101.0,i chose using light colored fabric inside of the car because dark colored fabric is attracting heat but she doesn t want the car to be hot so the light colored fabric would deflect the heat from going inside the car,3
139513.0,using light color fabric on the insides will help prevent the solar radiation from the sun from being absorbed by the fabrics,4
136364.0,the light colors will reflect more light because the closer the color is to white the more the color will reflect keeping the car cooler inside,4
136384.0,light colors reflect the sun s rays whereas dark colors absorb it,5
149960.0,the light color stuff reflects hot air away,3
118473.0,becuse dark things atrack black things,2
136355.0,i chose to use a light colored paint on the outside and a light colored fabric on the inside of the car if you chose a light colored fabric all the colors will reflect it so it will be less hot,3
139775.0,because dark colors absorb laura should use a light colored paint on the outside so that it heat doesn t go into the car,3
154214.0,because light colors reflect heat and don t absorb heat,4
118401.0,light colors don t absorb as much energy from the sun as you can with dark colors,4
149961.0,light and light will not absorb the heat,3
150206.0,well light colores dont atract the sun,2
139513.0,using a light colored fabric on the inside of the car will absorb less heat than that off a darker colored,3
118313.0,lighter fabric will absorb less radiation than darker fabric so if i choose light fabric the car will stay colder than dark fabric,4
139477.0,the darker car paint and fabric then the more light will be absorbed making the car hotter,4
151198.0,light colors reflect the sun and dark colors attract the sun,3
136566.0,i chose this because white colored stuff reflects heat and a dark colored fabric on the inside because all the heat in the car will be absorb into the sun shade,4
139831.0,using light colors are significant in reducing heat in the car as it sits in the sun as light colors are more easy to release heat as dark colors retain heat better,2
139543.0,this is because since white absorbs the least amount of heat the outside color would still make a difference but the inside is what really matters because the air is trapped inside with no opening,3
150111.0,because dark coalars atracks heat like black,2
136425.0,you pick light colors because it reflects the sun s light which creates heat if she chose dark colors it would be hotter because dark colors black for instance absorbs heat,5
150143.0,sun shines on dark colored thing but reflects off light colored things,3
139865.0,the dark color paint would reflect some of the light out back towards the atmosphere the light colored fabric would reflect some of the light off inside the car,3
139815.0,using lighter colors will not absorb as much radiation and heat as the darker colors would for an example black cars usually are hotter to touch then white,4
136477.0,i think it will be light colored paint on the outside and light colored fabric on the inside of the car because it will make it reflect the heat outside and not inside,3
139510.0,light colored items tend to reflect light more than dark colored objects which absorbs heat,5
139521.0,light colored paint reflect most of the light from the solar radiation which less light is absorbed and less heat is stored by the conversion of light energy to heat energy,5
139826.0,light colored paint reflects light waves being emitted from the sun so it will not absorb the sun s heat dark colors actually absorb heat therefore if the car were to be painted dark it would absorb the sun s heat and warm up,5
136355.0,to keep the car cool you don t want a dark color because all it will do is absorb the heat also the lighter the color the less it absorbs heat,3
118467.0,using light colored fabric will not absorb the heat such as the dark colored fabric that will absorb the heat,3
118592.0,i am going to with light colored on the outside and also the inside because the light color wont atract the sun if you use the dark color you are making the suns heat go inside your car that is why i would use light colors in the inside and the outside the car,2
150065.0,light colors such as white reflect the sun s rays keeping the car cooler than a black car with dark leather because black and other dark colors absorb heat,5
153852.0,we chose the first answer because bright light reflects and it keeps the car from heating up,3
118293.0,you would want to use light colored paint and light colored fabric because dark colors absorbe heat and light colors don t,3
154109.0,i said using like color on the inside and outside because light color reflect,3
136391.0,i think its black because light can reflect off all colors but black so if it does not reflect it would be going direct towards it and get kept there,4
139541.0,less heat is absorbed when the color is light and more reflection occurs if the light is light rather than dark less heat will be absorbed and therefore it will keep the car cool,4
118313.0,light colored fabric takes less sunlight,3
141561.0,i picked this because if you have light colors on the outside you will have less heat trapped in the car because it will reflect the heat if you us light paint it reflects the heat from the outside also making it cooler,3
150066.0,well i picked both that has to do with light because black paper and paint will absorb the heat not reflect the heat,4
139522.0,using light colored fabric keeps the air cool and reflects the heat molecules,2
136360.0,so it reflects the suns heat,2
136564.0,i know this is the right choice because light colors have a high albedo darker colors have a low albedo and absorb heat which would make the car hotter the lighter color would reflect the heat,4
