139870.0,with a lighter color like white the sun reflects its heat away more efficiently than with a darker color like black which absorbs heat,2
139855.0,she should use a light color because dark colors absorbs more heat than lighter colors they get the most heat light colors reflect heat from the sun which is why light colored clothes help us cool when its hot sunny,2
139769.0,dark colors absorb heat more than light colors using light colors will help reflect the light away from the car and the heat,5
150069.0,you would need a light colored car because dark colors attract and absorb heat i know this because my dads car is always outside on the seats are dark colored it is always hot when you get in,3
139847.0,you should have light colored paint to reflect more light elsewhere rather then retain it in the car and you would have a larger area of high reflectivity than a light color fabric would on the inside,4
136485.0,because if it s light colored it might basically not get your car to hot and might reflect back to the sun because of the light color,3
139518.0,the light colored fabric on the inside of a car will keep the car cool while it sits in the sun because the light color fabric doesn t absorb heat light dark colored fabric would,3
154000.0,it would be smart because barker colors atract heat and absorb,3
154202.0,she should do this because light colored paint will reflect light the other direction,4
136503.0,these two choices reflect light and doesn t absorbs it,3
136481.0,since dark colours like black navy blue and ect make things hotter by attracting heat people can change that by using light colours to reflect heat,2
136406.0,sence light colars dont atrack heat and solor radiation as much as dark colars if the car had light colars in the inside out it could be less hot,2
118480.0,i think its important to have light paint on the outside because the it will make it reflect off the car if it were dark paint it would attract the sun instead of reflect it,2
154194.0,the dark color paint will absorb most of the energy will the fabric will reflect more energy out of the car making it as cool as posible,5
150076.0,i think using a light colored paint on the outside is important to keep the car cool while it sits in the sun because using dark colored paint will absorb more heat than light color ones,4
151209.0,i dot no,1
136394.0,i picked light colored paint because it would reflect more light and absorb less light then black,4
154330.0,light fabric on the car because the sun will reflect off of it also keeping the light fabric inside the car is better so it does not go in the c,3
136457.0,light colored items have higher albedo so it can reflect sunlight better than dark colored item which have low albedo the lower the albedo it s more likely to absorb the sunlight and gain heat,5
118401.0,light colors don t obsorb as much light as the dark colors,4
118452.0,light color does not absorb the sun dark colors do,3
150063.0,light colors reflect light so not as much heat will be absorbed meaning the car will not get too hot,4
150065.0,light colors reflect heat so she should have light colored thing inside and outside of your car,3
150170.0,i think she should use a light colored fabric in the car because if you used a dark colored fabric in the car it will get hot because darker colors absorb more heat,3
136464.0,the reason is that because light color does not absorb as much heat as dark color if she were to put a dark color in or outside of her car it would make the temperature increase but however with a light color it will reflect the heat and make the cars temperature cooler same instead of getting hot that is my reasoning for this question,4
136476.0,i chose using a light colored paint on the outside of the car because light colors reflect other colors i also chose using light colored fabric on the inside of the car because of the same reason,3
150144.0,dark conducts heat light doesn t conduct heat,3
139824.0,light colored fabric reflects heat whereas dark color fabric would absorb heat making the car hot,4
151223.0,the light paint and fabric will have the heat bounce off instead of being trapped,3
118561.0,if she uses light colors she the heat will reflect of the fabric and paint,3
139533.0,lighter colors reflect more sun rays than dark colors do so keeping everything light will allow the car to stay cooler since the heat is being reflected away,4
136395.0,since white has a high albedo it will reflect most of the sunlight that hitsit therefore the white colors on the car will help keep the car cool because there will be very little heat absorbed,4
154108.0,using light colors for both the inside and outside of the car is important because the light colors reflect the sunlight off,4
136417.0,light colors are better because it will reflect the brightness of it,3
118622.0,the darker colors are the more they attract rays of sun or for instance heat if the fabric and paint on the car are light colored it would reflect heat,3
154123.0,because dark color atrack heat so it will get much warmer,2
136423.0,light colored paint on the outside would make the car cooler because light colors deflect the sun s radiation on the inside there should be dark colored fabric becuase then it won t deflect heat onto the inside of the car instead it will soak in the heat,5
118339.0,dark colors absorbs heat so light colors are better unless it is cold,3
118321.0,if you put a light colored paint on he outside the car because if you put black on the outside it will get warm faster and if put light color fabric on the inside it will stay fresh and to warm,2
136467.0,a light colored paint would reflect the sunlight so it would keep the car cooler,4
139881.0,because light colors bounce out the heat from the sun,2
153978.0,scientists have proven that dark colors such as black attract heat therefore a light colored car and a light colored fabric are a better option if you don t want your car to get hot,2
136489.0,well since the light colors reflect the heat won t absorb it will reflect the heat out to the outside,3
118593.0,if the paint and fabric is light colored the car wont heat up as much,2
118444.0,the light color of the car will deflect some of the suns rays and any other heat that manages to get in will be reflected by the light colored seats,3
139768.0,the light colors makes the sunlight bounce off the car rather than absorbing it,5
118368.0,use a light colored fabric to reflect all the heat back at the sun,3
118311.0,because the dark fabric is more thick and it can handle a lot of heat,2
136469.0,i think that using light colored fabric will help because it reflects heat and other colors using dark colored fabric would just aborbed the heat making it hotter,4
136503.0,the light colored objects reflect heat so less heat is obsorbed there for the car dosen t get to hot,3
139774.0,using a light color will keep the car cool while it sits in the sun because darker colors make it hot and darker colors absorbs more heat while light colors helps us cool when its hot,3
139518.0,using light colored fabric on the inside of a car will help keep laura cool because the light colors absorb less of the light from the sun if the interior were black then all the energy from the sun s rays will be absorbed,4
154306.0,i know that lighter colors don t attract much heat as the darker ones so light paint and fabric will reduce the heat in the car,2
150101.0,i chose using light colored fabric inside of the car because dark colored fabric is attracting heat but she doesn t want the car to be hot so the light colored fabric would deflect the heat from going inside the car,3
118442.0,because light and heat is less attracted to lighter colors,2
151176.0,light colors make the sun reflect off it dark colors attract the sun,3
118539.0,the dark absorbs light in the inside but the light color will reflect the light so not that much light will get in,5
136387.0,the light colored car and fabrics will reflect most of the rays from the sun resulting as the car being cooler,4
118470.0,dark colors and black will attract more heat than lighter colors,2
118440.0,you should use light colors on and in the car because the sun aborbs the the dark colors such as black if you have light colors the car will not get as hot that is why when you make solar ovens you use black paper,3
136408.0,light colors reflect the light dark colors absorb the light,5
139501.0,light colored things reflect and does not absorb much heat but dark colored things absorb more heat so if you were to cool off a car you would use something light and not dark in color basically you would use something that would not absorb the heat but reflect the heat,4
139542.0,light colors reflect light and absorb less heat a car with a light color all around would be cooler than a black colored car,5
136415.0,color bounces light easily,2
118598.0,i think she should us light colors because it attracts less sunlight and heat,3
118452.0,i think that it is the right choice to put a lighter color paint on the outside because dark colors obsorb the sun,3
118561.0,for example if the car is painted white on the outside the heat will bounce off it and if the fabric is white on the inside it won t absorb it,2
118544.0,the darker the color the more heat it absorbs so the hotter it gets and the lighter the color the color it gets so the car wont get to hot on the inside if its a lighter color on the inside,3
150054.0,light colors inside can help support heat and using black for the outside can also help by extracting heat from outside,2
136375.0,the car will be cooler because dark colord fabrics absorb the heat so if you use a light colord fabric it dose not absorb the heat therefor if will be cooler,3
136560.0,because the light paint and the light colored fabric will keep her car cool because it reflesct sunligt,4
149588.0,i picked the third one because if you put a light color in the inside the it will reflect off it and won t get the car hot,3
150138.0,it will bounce off the light fabric back at the sun,3
150247.0,because the light reflects of light colers,4
139491.0,by using a light colored paint outside preventing the car form absorb too much heat from the sun and that could help the car cooler,2
118604.0,dark colors absorb heat where as lighter colors reflect heat,3
136409.0,white reflects all colors which makes white a colder color,3
118587.0,you should use a light colored car because dark color has more heat,2
136489.0,well if the inside and outside of her car was a darker color the heat would all be absorbed into the seats making it hot if the inside and outside of the car was a lighter color all the heat would reflect off of it instead,4
136508.0,i chose to use a light colored aint and fabric because light colors like white reflects light the car will be cool all day long if she used dark colored fabric and paint they will absorb the liight and will make the car too hot,5
150117.0,i picked the dark because he dark can reflect off the black fabric or paint,2
153909.0,light colors in general reflect the suns radiation back to the sun but dark colors do the opposite they attract heat that s why she need a light color paint and cloth rather then a dark paint and cloth,4
153916.0,lighter colors reflect the sunlight and will keep the car cooler,4
118485.0,the bright white works like a reflection panal and the sunlight bounces of the white,4
150200.0,i chose this because bright colors reflect the heat away,3
154846.0,laura should use light colored fabric for the inside and the outside of the car because light colors don t absorb heat as much as dark colors do,3
139481.0,when using a light colored paint and fabric it is not absorbing as much heat as a car with black paint and fabric,3
136453.0,i chose a and c because lighter colors reflect light meanwhile darker colors absorb light creating heat heating up the car,5
139785.0,light colored paint and fabric will increase the amount of reflectivity which will then be able to reflect a larger amount of solar radiation and make the car more cooler than a car with dark colors,4
118515.0,i think it should be a light colored fabric because according to other peoples solar ovens they used dark construction paper on the inside and it was way hotter on degrees than others so maybe the lighter the better,2
139516.0,the light colored objects absorbs less heat then the dark colored objects so the car would keep cooler if they use a lighter colored object,3
136476.0,i chose using a light colored paint on the outside of the car because light paint will reflect the sun as the dark paint will absorb the heat i also chose use light colored fabric on the inside of the car because of the same thing,4
153818.0,light colored material reflect more light an energy than dark colored materials,4
118338.0,usually dark colors attract the sun and light colors usually reflect off the sun so if you get or have a light colored car it will reflect off of the sun and will not attract the heat,3
136392.0,the lighter the color is the less hotter it will get since dark colors absorb more heat you ll want to have light colors for your car,3
136356.0,i picked using light colored fabric on the inside of the car i picked this because it is light colored and light colors help reflect solar radiation also the fabric will act like an insulator if some of the heat gets absorbed than the fabric will keep the heat from getting inside,4
154327.0,the light paint fabric will reflect off the sun s heat,3
118320.0,if she were to paint the outside of the car nothing would happen if she put dark colored fabric in the car the sun would reflect off of the fabric and it would be hot so that s why i chose light colored fabric,2
149959.0,because if we used dark colored fabric it will absorb light and make the car hotter,4
150168.0,why i chose the light colored answers is because light colored objects reflect the sun and does not heat up,3
118343.0,it should be a light color outside the car like white because light colors don t absorb the heat like dark colors do,3
139816.0,light colors do not attract light energy heat as well as dark colors do so the light colored options are better for keeping the car cooler,2
136361.0,light colored martial reflects heat and dark colored martial absorbs so if she uses light colored martial it will reflect the heat out of the car,4
154152.0,i chose dark cooler because the light one because the light is like the sun,2
150900.0,so it reflects off of the car,3
151217.0,i do not know,1
136405.0,i chose this because light colored things don t absorb all the colors making it less hot when you have a black car or seats it can make your car very hot from the heat because it s asborbing all colors,3
136416.0,because heats bounces off light colors so the car absorbeds less heat to the car,4
151208.0,i chose light colored fabric because it will reflect out of the car,3
139544.0,using light colored paint and fabric outside the car inside allows heat to be reflected rather than it being absorbed,4
153912.0,dark colors get hotter than lighter colors dark colors attract radiation and lighter colors don t,3
136396.0,i picked this answer because if its hot outside and the car paint is black the light colored seats stay cool and don t heat up,2
150241.0,i chose to have a light color on the inside and a dark color on the outside because when you have a light color on the inside it will reflect the heat from the inside back to the outside,3
151198.0,light colors reflect the sun and dark colors attract the sun,3
150908.0,light paint and fabric because if it is dark it will absorb the heat in the car,3
139517.0,the light colored paint will reflect the light from the sun better leading to the light from the sun having a harder time to enter the car making it cooler,4
150235.0,light colors will keep the car cooler because dark colors absorb sunlight,4
153978.0,scientists have shown that dark colors like black will attract heat therefor a light colored car is the best option,2
150238.0,the light fabric on the inside of the car might protect the car from heat and reflect it out in the open,3
136512.0,if she wants to keep her car cool then she would want to use a lighter color since lighter colors reflect and darker colors absorb,4
139866.0,darker colors will absorb heat so if there is a lighter color fabric inside it will cool down faster,3
139485.0,dark colored fabrics allow for the heat to be trapped for example if you were black colored clothing on a hot day you will get hotter instead of cooling off the light colored fabric in the inside of the car will allow the radiation to get trapped onto the fabric but it will not go any further than the fabric,3
118483.0,using light colored fabric is good because light colored fabric reflects heat,3
136460.0,a darker color would have absorbed most of the heat yet with a lighter colored paint the heat would be able to reflect off the paint if it would have absorbed the heat the car would be much more hot than the light colored car,4
139826.0,light colored paint reflects light waves being emitted from the sun so it will not absorb the sun s heat dark colors actually absorb heat therefore if the car were to be painted dark it would absorb the sun s heat and warm up,5
136391.0,i chose light color fabric because the darker the fabric like black the light can not reflect making it hot,4
149972.0,light colored paint will prevent most heat form entering the car because it s reflective dark colored fabric on the inside will let the heat escape more easily than light colored fabric,3
118469.0,the black on the inside absorbs the heat than can get in because the white outside reflects the heat away,4
139831.0,the pigment matters because the ones on the lighter side of the spectrum does not absorb uv light as well as the dark ones making it an effective choice to keeping the car cool,4
139539.0,the solar radiation bounces off and does not get absorbed because black does not have a heat wave than other colors the brighter the light is the more heat energy there is,3
154121.0,the sun will reflect,3
154107.0,doing a light colored paint on the outside and inside because dark colors attracts heat while light color reflects heat,3
139797.0,dark colored objects will absorb more heat than lighter colored objects because it absorbs all of the colors but lighter colored objects will not absorb as many colors,3
150093.0,i think light colored paint because if you use white then it will move away from the sun and if you use dark colors like black then that will attract the sun,3
150134.0,light doesn t absorb the heat as much as dark does,4
150174.0,the light paint will deflect the heat,3
153979.0,because light colors help the sun reflect of dark colors make the sun stay on for hours,2
118454.0,lighter colors reflect the sun away,3
136518.0,i think laura should use a light colored paint on the inside and outside of the car because light colors reflect heat and dark colors absorb heat i also think that she should get both the light colored fabric and paint because light colors are going to reflect the light and not make the car as hot as dark colors would if laura uses both light colors her car will reflect all the heat but if she uses dark colors her car will absorb all the heat,4
154107.0,using light colored paint because light colors reflect heat and dark colors attract heat,3
154109.0,i choice light color for the inside fabric and the outside paint because if you use light color it will reflect the sun but if you use dark colors it will absorb the sun,4
154325.0,dark colored paint will deflect light so it shines away from the car,3
150117.0,i picked light colored paint in the outside and light colored fabric in the inside because i think that light colors will not let the heat go in the car i think it will just bounce off the car and it won t be hot,3
136398.0,i picked these choices because dark colors like black are known to absorb heat light colors like white are known to reflect light this explains my choices,5
139819.0,using a light colored paint makes it so it doesn t absorb as much heat from the sun in comparison to dark colors,2
118545.0,by doing this the color on the outside will reflect more heat than the dark colored one if you use a light colored fabric on the inside it will reflect off more heat than the other fabric,3
136477.0,i put using light colored fabric on the inside of the car because light colors reflect,3
118321.0,if you put dark paint on the outside it will attract a lot of solar radiation and if you put light colored paint it won t attract any solar radiation do not use any dark colored fabric because it will attract a lot solar radiation and if you put light colored fabric it won t attract any solar radiation,3
150249.0,i see many people use it on the inside of the windshield,2
154330.0,because it will reflect of the light color and,3
118297.0,using light colored outside and inside paint will make it cooler than having the dark paint absorbing sun light and the make the car hot,4
153984.0,what i chose is correct because wearing a black or dark shirt or cloths will suck in the heat from the suns solar rays,3
154371.0,just couse,1
150092.0,dark ofodes the dark,2
136569.0,fabric is not as thin as paint and a light color would keep the car cooler,2
139498.0,since light colors doesn t absorb as much heat as dark colors using a light colored fabric might be necessary to keep the car cool while it sits in the sun,3
118445.0,since black objects absorb heat a light object wouldn t so it wouldn t heat up as much,3
136359.0,if you have a light colored paint on the outside your car will reflect heat instead of absorbing heat and if you have a light colored fabric inside your car the fabric won t get super hot,3
118468.0,light colored fabric makes it so you are cooler on warm days but black dark colors absorbs the heat making the car warmer,3
118372.0,if the color of the car is light then the heat will reflect and keep the inside cool,3
118459.0,using the light color fabric and the color paint it will reflect of the heat like color fabric,3
139643.0,darker colors absorb more heat so by using a lighter colored paint and fabric which absorbs less heat this will help keep the car cooler,3
118473.0,becuse dark things atrack black things,2
118338.0,i picked those choices because light colors usually reflect off the sun and dark colors absorb the sun so if you have a dark color the heat will stay in or on the car but if you use light colors it will knock the hat off of it,4
136395.0,light colors absorb less heat than dark colors therefore having ligher colors will help keep your car cooler,4
118341.0,using light colored paints and fabrics reflect the heat off of them instead of absorbing the heat like dark colors,4
118308.0,if you have dark leather in side like black it makes your car hotter cause black leather attracts sunlight,3
118299.0,well if you have a lighter shade of paint on your car and you were in the sun it reflect more to the sun but if you had a darker shade then it wouldnt,3
154311.0,if you put the fabric pn the car it prevents the heat gose in side and dark fabric is much better because is not going to reflect,2
139506.0,since we are talking about the inside of the car we don t want to know about the outside material since using a light fabric is best because it reflects the most light and it also doesn t let the air particles heat up,4
136375.0,the color white or any light colord fabric dose not absorb any colors making it cool on the inside of the car,2
139527.0,using light colored fabric on the inside of the car does not absorb heat like the dark colored fabric same goes for the light colored paint compared to dark colored paint,3
136467.0,using light colors means the colors reflect the sun if you chose darker colors the colors will absorb the suns heat,4
150648.0,using light colored things will not absorb the heat like dark colored things,4
136372.0,she should use a dark colored car and a dark fabric on the inside because a dark colored car will keep the heat in and will not bounce off another car which will bring more heat in and if she used a light colored fabric on the inside the heat would bounce of the seat making the car hotter,2
136517.0,i think this because the heat will bounce off and not get absorbed,2
136409.0,light colors reflect other colors which makes lighter colors cooler when in the sun,3
139510.0,light colored items do not absorb heat as easily has darker colored objects it reflects light,5
118346.0,because the light color fabric inside the car will not observe as many as the black one,3
