118364.0,the light colored paint will reflect the sun away,3
136413.0,she wouldn t want the inside of her car to get hot so she would put light colored fabric inside and it would not absorb it,2
118341.0,using light colored paints and fabrics reflect the heat off of them instead of absorbing the heat like dark colors,4
153823.0,light colored fabric because the lighter the color the less energy it will absorb,4
153816.0,dark colors conduct heat,2
118480.0,i think its important to have light paint on the outside because the it will make it reflect off the car if it were dark paint it would attract the sun instead of reflect it,2
139506.0,the light colored fabric reflects the sunlight and prevents light from entering,4
136363.0,because if it s darker the fabric will absorb the light but if it s lighter it will deflect it,5
118548.0,laura should use light colored fabric on the inside because it wont obsorb heat like if you put dark fabric,3
150921.0,black absorbs all light and turns it into heat but white does not,5
118391.0,the light colored fabric will deflect the sun s rays from getting inside while the dark colored fabric will absorb the sun s rays and let it in the car,4
136405.0,i chose this because the dark paint would take in the sun s heat and the car would get hot with the lighter paint it will reflect more heat than absorb it this same things goes for the fabric,2
136465.0,she should light colors because it reflect the heat,3
118533.0,light colors don t trap as much heat as dark color,2
136454.0,if you use a light color fabric its will reflect all the heat that try s to come in the car,3
139826.0,light colored paint reflects light waves being emitted from the sun so it will not absorb the sun s heat dark colors actually absorb heat therefore if the car were to be painted dark it would absorb the sun s heat and warm up,5
118536.0,dark colors absorb the heat energy making it hotter,4
150195.0,she should use light colored paint and fabric because dark colors such as black attract the sun while light colors like with reflect the sun,3
150077.0,light colors prevent heat from going inside and creating conduction dark colors take the heat and seal it so that it goes inside so if your car is hot it s probably because you have dark colors on the inside and or outside,4
136456.0,since lighter colors have a high albedo the ability to reflect light the car would reflect the heat with lighter color fabric and paint,4
118308.0,using a light colored paint will reflect more sun and a dark colored paint will absorb more sun and a light colored fabric will reflect and a dark colored fabric will absorb,4
118307.0,because dark colors are heated up faster,2
136560.0,because it can reflect the sun from the car,3
139536.0,light colored paint and fabric reflect radiation more than dark colored paint and fabric the less radiation is absorbed the less heat will be inside of the car,4
136513.0,because we ve learned that darker colors absorb heat and lighter colors reflect heat,4
139824.0,i chose light colored everything because darker colors absorb more light and heat than lighter colors,4
150219.0,laura will want a light colored car because then it will not absorb heat it will reflect it,4
139849.0,the car fabric conducts heat from the light outside,4
136422.0,using a light colored paint or fabric absorbs less heat than dark colored paint and fabric,3
149950.0,because the sun reflects off bright colors,3
136413.0,the light colored fabric would reflect the heat out of the car so the heat that got inside would leave if it was on the outside it could not do that,3
154324.0,the white will reflect the heat and black will attract heat,3
139495.0,because light colored fabric does not absorb light and reflects it,4
118514.0,if you paint your car a light color it will reflect more heat than a dark color dark colors absorb heat and that would let the heat pass into the car also if you parked next to a dark car that would attract more sunlight than your lightly painted car,5
154371.0,just couse,1
136485.0,because if it s light colored it might basically not get your car to hot and might reflect back to the sun because of the light color,3
139812.0,the lighter fabric reflects the sun from hitting the car so basically it blocks heat from being moved into the car,3
118445.0,since black objects absorb heat a light object wouldn t so it wouldn t heat up as much,3
118580.0,i choose that answer because it might reflect off the car using the light coverd paint,2
118345.0,this is right because this paint will reflect the heat,2
136417.0,light colors are better because it will reflect the brightness of it,3
118323.0,i belive light colors atract less sun light and darker colors atract more sunlight,3
150170.0,i think she should use a light colored fabric in the car because if you used a dark colored fabric in the car it will get hot because darker colors absorb more heat,3
118293.0,you would want to use light colored paint and light colored fabric because dark colors absorbe heat and light colors don t,3
118299.0,well if you had a dark colored fabric on the inside it would nor reflect as much as the light colored fabric and for the dark colored cars well that would help just a little but it would still reflect,3
150063.0,i chose my answer because light colors reflect heat,3
118346.0,the dark color will observe more heat,2
150917.0,the sun s radiation is attracted to darker colors the car would get hotter if it had dark colors the car will still get hot with light colors but if you had darker colors the car would be really hot,3
136549.0,you want the car to be lighter because when light hits white it absorbs all color making it cooler when you have dark items it makes the items hotter we have this in are notes when we write about the country and the city,2
139830.0,black cars tend to attract more sunlight and rise in temperature on the inside and outside of the car so switching to a lighter colored paint would make this not possible,2
153916.0,lighter colors reflect the sunlight and will keep the car cooler,4
118394.0,the light colors don t absorb heat dark colors like black make it hotter in the car because it absorbs heat,3
118344.0,i chose the light covered fabric because dack stuff absorb the light and heat it up more,4
150105.0,i think she should use light paint and light material because dark atracts heat and light doesn t,3
150061.0,i chose light colors because light colors reflects heat so if you have light colors in and on your car your car won t get so hot when it s in the sun,3
136499.0,she should use us light colored paint on the outside and a dark colored fabric on the inside the light colored paint wil reflect the sun s light and the dark colored fabric will absorb the heat on the inside of the car,4
118586.0,if you use light colored paint the heat will reflect the heat and if you use light colored fabric it will reflect the heat from the car,3
118515.0,i think it could be a lighter colored fabric because maybe the darker the fabric is the warmer your car will get,2
118355.0,the heat reflects the light,3
149972.0,having two layers of light colored things will let minimal heat in any heat that gets in won t get absorbed into the car because there is light colored fabric,3
118456.0,i picked light colored paint and fabric because the sun reflects off of light colors and darker colors attract the heat,3
118535.0,as everyone knows darker colors attracts more light than lighter colors so if she had a lighter paint and a lighter fabric the sun will not attract as much as a darker fabric and paint will and will also keep the car cool,2
154111.0,i think this because the heat will reflect right off the car,3
139882.0,using light colored fabric on the inside of the car will help keep the car cool because it doesn t absorb as much heat as dark colored fabric does,3
118473.0,becuse dark things atrack black things,2
118368.0,use a light colored fabric to reflect all the heat back at the sun,3
136367.0,i choose a and c because black absorbs heat and white dose not,2
136511.0,because white reflects all colors and black absorobs color,4
118602.0,i chose light colored paint because if the car was a dark colored pain like black it would attract the light and the car would heat up faster,3
118372.0,if the color of the car is light then the heat will reflect and keep the inside cool,3
154153.0,so the sun light will reflect,4
136379.0,using a light color fabric means it reflect light so it doesn t get hot,4
136501.0,i think this because the light colors on the outside of her car would reflect back some of the solar radiation making it less hot also that would be the same for having light colored fabric inside of the car,4
118467.0,using light colored fabric will not absorb the heat such as the dark colored fabric that will absorb the heat,3
118560.0,when you put dark colored fabric the sun reflects dark colored fabric,2
136368.0,well a light colored paint will reflect the heat from the sun if you put a dark colored paint on the car it would absorb the heat making your car hotter,2
136512.0,if she wants to keep her car cool then she would want to use a lighter color since lighter colors reflect and darker colors absorb,4
154214.0,keeping the whole car light and shiny reflects the sun s rays away from the car,4
118304.0,light colors deflect heat while dark colors absorb heat,4
150128.0,light colors reflect heat so the car would stay cooler on the inside because it would reflect the suns rays,4
136550.0,as we said a while back white items reflects light but black absorbs all of it so if she uses white it shouldn t get too hot,5
118438.0,you shouldn t use anything dark because black absorbs sun if you painted your car light it would still be hot due to the material of the car the best thing to do is put a light colored fabric over the car,3
153852.0,i chose black because it wont reflect and there is going to be no bright light inside the car and white will reflect and will make the sun come towards the car even more,3
150066.0,well i picked both that has to do with light because black paper and paint will absorb the heat not reflect the heat,4
139537.0,light colored paint on the outside tends to reflect more solar radiation because the light color of the paint tends to reflect more solar radiation than a dark colored painted car this will cause less solar radiation to become infrared radiation,5
139507.0,darker colors especially black absorb heat heat while lighter colors like white reflect heat so in an effort to try and keep the car cool while it sits in the sun laura should aim to use a light colored car with a light fabric interior,4
139643.0,light color absorbs less heat thus the car will be cooler,3
136553.0,because darker things adsorb and will get hotter and lighter things don t adsorb they reflect so if it reflect the sun light then it won t get hot,5
139501.0,light colored things reflect and does not absorb much heat but dark colored things absorb more heat so if you were to cool off a car you would use something light and not dark in color basically you would use something that would not absorb the heat but reflect the heat,4
150077.0,light colors don t absorb much heat unlike dark colors that do the light colors will prevent the sun from heating up too much,4
118622.0,dark colers attract heat so the light colers will reflect more solar radition rather than absorb it,5
139516.0,dark colors generally absorb more heat then light colors,3
139479.0,darker colors absorb larger amounts of energy from the sun,4
136482.0,black it the most absorbent of all of the colors therefore making dark colored paints and fabric more absorbent making the car hot on a sunny day,3
154914.0,she should use light colored materials because it reflects the light when dark colors absorb it and make it hotter,5
139822.0,light colors do not absorb light as much as dark colors do,4
136461.0,the light is being reflected by the light colored things in the car and around it sending the light into the air making it hotter not the car,3
118586.0,dark color absorbs sunlight and light color reflects sunlight,5
118560.0,i choose the light colored because if it was dark the sun would reflect dark color,2
136356.0,i picked using light colored fabric on the inside of the car i picked this because it is light colored and light colors help reflect solar radiation also the fabric will act like an insulator if some of the heat gets absorbed than the fabric will keep the heat from getting inside,4
154324.0,white reflects heat so if everything is white it should keep heat away better than black will black attracts heat,3
136460.0,a darker color would have absorbed most of the heat yet with a lighter colored paint the heat would be able to reflect off the paint if it would have absorbed the heat the car would be much more hot than the light colored car,4
136564.0,using almost anything light colored helps because light colors have a high albedo so the light reflects and goes somewhere else besides the car dark colors have low albedos and so the heat would be absorbed making the car hotter,5
153909.0,light colors in general reflect the suns radiation back to the sun but dark colors do the opposite they attract heat that s why she need a light color paint and cloth rather then a dark paint and cloth,4
136424.0,a light color reflects light better than a dark color,4
118600.0,light colors reflect and dark colors colect,3
136500.0,i chose this because light colors reflect the sunlight while black and dark colors absorb the sun light,5
118351.0,light colors reflect heat so she should get many light objects in her car,3
154330.0,because it will reflect of the light color and,3
136384.0,light colors reflect the sun s rays whereas dark colors absorb it,5
118320.0,i chose this because the paint doesn t matter about the heat inside the car if she uses dark colored fabric the sun will reflect on it then it will be very hot so if she uses light colored fabric it will stay a little cool in her car,2
118350.0,use light colors because darker colors attract more heat and sunlight and light colors attract less,3
154026.0,you want to use lighter colors because dark colors attract the heat if you have lighter colors then the heat bounces off the light colors,3
154195.0,first of all dark colors attract sunlight so the and answers would not work secondly light colors repel heat energy the answer must be or i think it is one because that would allow the heat to not enter in the first place if the dark colored paint on the outside attract the heat by the time it wants to escape because of the light seats it would already be trapped,3
118310.0,i think the car should be painted a light color and not a dark color so the sun is not a tracked to the cars dark paint and it wouldn t bleach the dark color off,2
139544.0,using light colored paint and fabric outside the car inside allows heat to be reflected rather than it being absorbed,4
154325.0,using black fabric and paint will make the car hotter the color will absorb heat quicker if it is a dark color because it is dark and dark colors don t deflect heat as well as light colors do light colors will deflect heat more because of their brightness,4
118487.0,a light colored paint would reflect the solar radiation,4
139514.0,more of the sun s energy would be reflected so less light energy would be absorbed,5
118444.0,the light colored fabric will partially reflect the heat away from the car,3
136457.0,light colors reflect reflects sunlight and they don t absorb much heat compared to dark colors they absorb a lot of heat and sunlight so using light colors would probably but still your car is a hunk of metal still going to heat up unless you find a tree to hind under,5
150116.0,light color paint will not attract heat like dark colored paint the light color will repel a little,3
136455.0,white and softer colored cars would be laura s best choices of staying cool because whiter shades reflect light while black absorbs it making summer days in the car almost unbearably hot inside,5
150168.0,why i chose the light colored answers is because light colored objects reflect the sun and does not heat up,3
149963.0,i chose those two answers because anything with a light color like white reflects of the heat from the sun so it doesn t get as hot as dark colored things,4
136451.0,because if you put a darker color paint on the car it will absorb the solar energy why as the light color on the outside will reflect the solar energy,5
139519.0,light colors reflect light so much of the sunlight that hits the car s surface can be reflected off,4
118601.0,she should use a light colored paint because it will reflect all the heat off the car,3
136569.0,fabric is not as thin as paint and a light color would keep the car cooler,2
154212.0,i think this because the solar oven that has the most heat had black paper inside so to get the oposite i did light colored paper,3
136555.0,i feel like dark colors are better at reflecting heat then light colors,2
154310.0,i think both because the fabric will block the sun and make it reflect it might depend on light or dark but i think the dark one will work because the construction paper,3
118444.0,the light color of the car will deflect some of the suns rays and any other heat that manages to get in will be reflected by the light colored seats,3
150109.0,she should use a light colored paint on the outside because if you use a light colored paint it will reflect the heat,3
155334.0,because it can reflect the sun light from getting the car hot,4
139527.0,light colors reflect heat more than darker colors which absorb heat,4
139487.0,light colored fabrics do not absorb energy as much as dark colored fabric the fabric being in the car will keep it cool as heat will not be trapped inside the car,4
118473.0,because people now that black attracts the suns heat and white reflects the suns heat,2
139511.0,choosing a light color paint will help reflect some of that ultraviolet radiation from the sun because if you have a dark colored car the darker color will absorb a lot of the heat from the sun increasing the temperature paint color is a important factor for the temperature on the inside and outside of your car so chose a light colored paint for your car if you live in a warm place also depending on where you live will affect what paint type you want,2
136378.0,the white colored paint would reflect the heat but if the white colored paint was in the inside the hot air would go in the car reflects off and gets trapped by the window so then the hot air would heat the car that is why i would put it on the outside,3
136403.0,if you use light colored things in or on your car like light colored fabric on the inside of the car and light colored paint on the outside then your car will stay cool because dark colored objects absorb the suns heat and become very hot so you should use light colored objects for your car in the summer in order for your car to stay cool,2
136576.0,i say that you use a light color paint on the outside and a light color for the fabric because dark colors attract heat and get hot very fast but if you use light colors they are known to reflect sun mostly and don t get as hot as fast as dark colors do,2
136370.0,i think this because using white will reflect the light and you want to have it on the outside because metal is a conductor,4
139841.0,light colored fabric would allow for less radiation absorption,4
118466.0,light things reflect heat and dark things attract heat,3
139778.0,the light colored paint will reflect the sunlight the heat will decrease then causing the temperature to be lower,4
136493.0,colors such as white and light colors light this reflects heat while colors such as black and dark colors absorb it,4
118298.0,the light colored paint on the outside will reflect the heat back out from the car also with the light colored fabric inside but if there was dark colored fabric and paint it will absorb the heat in the car,4
151224.0,light colors such as white bounce or reflect sunlight some heat stays but it will not be as hot as where she uses black which absorbs heat,5
153917.0,i think this because the light color don t prevent heat and dark colors do and i also think the light colored fabric will work also because it won t burn your behind,2
154325.0,dark colored paint will deflect light so it shines away from the car,3
153818.0,light colored things are more reflective and will heat up less,3
118461.0,the darker the color the more heat it attracts and so if the fabric and paint is light colors there will be less heat in the car,2
118406.0,the light color paint out side so the solar radiation would be less likely so seep through the metal under,3
136354.0,i chose toughs answers because the light colored stuff reflects the sun and the dark colors stuff obsorbes the light,5
136517.0,i think this because the heat will bounce off and not get absorbed,2
136505.0,these are important because using light fabric and a light paint will make the car reflect sunlight which is reflecting some of the heat that may have gone into the car to make it warmer this is because white has a low albedo and reflect light but if you were to use black materials the car would get hotter beucase it absorbs light and gets hotter,5
154128.0,light is attracted to dark colors so by using light colors your car will not be as open to the radiation,3
136415.0,color bounces light easily,2
149961.0,light and light will not absorb the heat,3
139497.0,lighter colors reflect light while darker colors absorb light using lighter colors will allow the car to remain the coolest,5
139539.0,using a dark colored paint on the outside of the car will not reflect or absorb light and so less light will travel inside the car,3
136558.0,because dark colors make it hotter and light colors are less absorbent,2
139790.0,all these light colored material will help bounce back the solar radiation,4
136514.0,i chose to use light colored paint on the outside because white reflects the sunlight that will make the car less hot since there is a light color on the outside so the car will not get super hot if there is a light colored paint on the outside of the car,4
154134.0,i said those were my chooses because sun rays are attracted to darker colored objects rather than lighter colored objects,3
139870.0,the lighter the color of the car both interior and exterior the more energy heat will be reflected keeping it cool,4
136362.0,light color will reflect the light so it does not come in to the car and i see people put those inside the car to keep it from getting hot,4
136367.0,i think that laura should by a light painted car and a light colored fabric because if you have a dark colored car the suns light will absorb the heat causing the inside to be warmer but if you use a light colored car the suns light will reflect the heat and the car wouldn t be so hot,5
154202.0,she should do this because light colored paint will reflect light the other direction,4
136492.0,i think she should use a light colored paint outside the car because a lighter color reflects the sun s radiation and bounces off the car,4
139806.0,i think the dark color paint would absorb more heat for the sunlight,4
136570.0,the car should have a light colored paint on the outside of the car because having a light colored paint will reflect the solar and uv radiation this is called albeto if some solar and uv rays do get in to car then the light colored fabric will reflect it back,4
118483.0,using light colored fabric is good because light colored fabric reflects heat,3
118544.0,the darker the color the more heat it absorbs so the hotter it gets and the lighter the color the color it gets so the car wont get to hot on the inside if its a lighter color on the inside,3
154000.0,it would be smart because barker colors atract heat and absorb,3
118561.0,if she uses light colors she the heat will reflect of the fabric and paint,3
154137.0,if laura wants to keep her car cool then she would want to have a plan like parking it under a tree or somewhere shady for example if laura had a black colored car it would be attracted to the sun i think if she has a light colored car and light colored fabric her car wouldn t get hot,2
