150248.0,i picked this because then it won t reflect that much,3
118538.0,the light color fabric reflects the sun from getting hot,3
136553.0,because lighter colors don t adsorb as much as darker colors so and because lighter colors do the opposite of darker colors they reflect,4
136522.0,i think using light colored fabric in the inside of the car is most important to keep the car not too hot because then it won t absorb a lot of heat and laura will probably want the inside of the car to kep cool and will not care very much about the outside being hot,3
118622.0,the darker colors are the more they attract rays of sun or for instance heat if the fabric and paint on the car are light colored it would reflect heat,3
139536.0,light colored objects tend to reflect more heat and not absorb heat,3
136391.0,i chose light color fabric because the darker the fabric like black the light can not reflect making it hot,4
153848.0,the lighter the color is the less the sun gets attracted too so when you have a dark shirt and your walking outside you will feel much more heat than when your outside and wearing lighter color shirt,2
139535.0,using light colored paint and fabric on the car will reflect radiation preventing heat from being able to penetrate and collect in the car,4
139491.0,by using a light colored paint outside preventing the car form absorb too much heat from the sun and that could help the car cooler,2
150153.0,light colors don t obsorb heat as well as dark colors,4
150235.0,light colors will keep the car cooler because dark colors absorb sunlight,4
139524.0,light colored fabrics reflect more light rays than darker colors which absorbs the suns rays,5
118561.0,if she uses light colors she the heat will reflect of the fabric and paint,3
154137.0,if laura wants to keep her car cool then she would want to have a plan like parking it under a tree or somewhere shady for example if laura had a black colored car it would be attracted to the sun i think if she has a light colored car and light colored fabric her car wouldn t get hot,2
118478.0,darker colored cars absorb the suns radiation,4
150062.0,i chose light colored fabric because if you use dark colored fabric it will absorb more heat so light colored fabric does not absorb as much heat as dark colored fabric,4
149963.0,i chose those two answers because anything with a light color like white reflects of the heat from the sun so it doesn t get as hot as dark colored things,4
150122.0,i chose light colored paint and fabric because light colored stuff reflects heat instead of absorbing it like dark colored things do,3
136413.0,she wouldn t want the inside of her car to get hot so she would put light colored fabric inside and it would not absorb it,2
139542.0,a lighter color would reflect heat,3
149956.0,light colors will not really get that hot compared to dark colors like black the sun will reflect off the black car making it hot with light colors the sun wont reflect off the car with light colors making it not as hot,2
118349.0,light colors don t radiate as much heat as dark cars do,2
139519.0,light colors reflect light so the solar radiation reflects off the cars surface preventing much of it from directly being absorbed into the car,5
139833.0,light colors will absorb less radiation so it will be cooler even if it is sitting in the sun,4
118320.0,i chose this because the paint doesn t matter about the heat inside the car if she uses dark colored fabric the sun will reflect on it then it will be very hot so if she uses light colored fabric it will stay a little cool in her car,2
154127.0,i chose light paint because darker colors absorb heat better than light colors and that means the paint won t absorb a lot of heat and energy therefore keeping it cool,4
139812.0,the lighter fabric reflects the sun from hitting the car so basically it blocks heat from being moved into the car,3
149961.0,it does not attract sunlight,3
118483.0,if you use light colored fabric inside the car the sun s heat will be reflected by the fabric,2
118525.0,light color would keep the car cooler because darkness absorbs more sunlight,4
139482.0,a light colored paint on the surface of your car will help reflect some of the radiation away from your car,4
139481.0,when using a light colored paint and fabric it would mean that these colors would not absorb much of sun light rather than using a darker color such as black,4
150204.0,dark colors attract more heat then lighter colors so if you don t want your car to get hot use warmer colors,3
118533.0,the light colored paint will reflect the heat light,4
154325.0,using black fabric and paint will make the car hotter the color will absorb heat quicker if it is a dark color because it is dark and dark colors don t deflect heat as well as light colors do light colors will deflect heat more because of their brightness,4
139520.0,having a light colored paint on the outside of the car will reduce the temperature of her car because light colored paint reflects more light reducing the temperature same thing with the light colored fabric inside the car the fabric will reflect light reducing the heat,4
139831.0,the pigment matters because the ones on the lighter side of the spectrum does not absorb uv light as well as the dark ones making it an effective choice to keeping the car cool,4
136399.0,the lighter color will not absorb as much sun radiation then the black color,4
136384.0,light colors reflect the sun s rays whereas dark colors absorb it,5
149590.0,because ussaly dark soaks up the heat,3
136505.0,i chose a and c because since white has a low albedo the white reflects off the sun and there will be not a lot of heat in the car where as black has a high albedo and would attract the sun therefore making the car hotter,2
118413.0,the light colered fabric will help because it will reflect the sun where as black sunlight will obsorb the sunlight,5
118444.0,the light color of the car will deflect some of the suns rays and any other heat that manages to get in will be reflected by the light colored seats,3
139544.0,in order to keep the car nice and cool while it sits in the sun using a light color would be the best choice because light colors tend to absorb less heat and reflect all wavelengths of light,4
139517.0,the light colored paint will reflect the light from the sun better leading to the light from the sun having a harder time to enter the car making it cooler,4
150065.0,light colors such as white reflect the sun s rays keeping the car cooler than a black car with dark leather because black and other dark colors absorb heat,5
139790.0,light colored paint bounces off the heat energy of the sun the dark will absorb it fabric also feels hotter than paint,5
136563.0,the light colors will reflect the heat so it won t get trapped in the sun,3
150242.0,the bright colors reflect heat while dark ones absorb more heat,4
139879.0,because light colored fabric will reflect the sun s rays not attract them,2
136492.0,i think this because the light colored paint will reflect the light back into the world,4
118607.0,dark colors absorbs more light and heat than lighter colors which reflect light and heat more since lighter colors reflect heat and light more using lighter colors will keep her car cool,5
118460.0,using a light colored fabric on the inside because if you put a dark colored one it can attract sunlight,3
139496.0,using any light colored paint or items would help out a lot because light colors like white doesn t absorb much heat from the sun this means that anything with light colors will be cooler on the other hand dark colors like black absorbs all the heat from the sun this means that anything with dark colors will be hotter,2
139478.0,darker colors such as black absorb the heat and sunlight more efficiently so it would cause laura s car to become hotter that is why using a lighter color paint for her care would be more efficinent because lighter colors reflect light and heat off better,5
118459.0,using the light color fabric and the color paint it will reflect of the heat like color fabric,3
150124.0,darker things absorb heat will lighter colored things dont atract heat,4
149972.0,light colored paint will prevent most heat form entering the car because it s reflective dark colored fabric on the inside will let the heat escape more easily than light colored fabric,3
139864.0,dark pigment absorbs more sunlight so you will feel more heat,4
153925.0,well if it is black it will absorbe the heat,3
118613.0,dark colors attract heat and light colors dont attract heat but reflect it,3
136395.0,since white has a high albedo it will reflect most of the sunlight that hitsit therefore the white colors on the car will help keep the car cool because there will be very little heat absorbed,4
118319.0,lighter colors do not absorb the heat but darker colors do absorb heat,3
150168.0,why i chose the light colored answers is because light colored objects reflect the sun and does not heat up,3
136450.0,the light color will reflect the heat on the inside and the outside,3
154121.0,the sun will reflect,3
136362.0,light color will reflect the light so it does not come in to the car and i see people put those inside the car to keep it from getting hot,4
136505.0,these are important because using light fabric and a light paint will make the car reflect sunlight which is reflecting some of the heat that may have gone into the car to make it warmer this is because white has a low albedo and reflect light but if you were to use black materials the car would get hotter beucase it absorbs light and gets hotter,5
118510.0,dark colors hold more heat so if you use light colors the heat wont get absorbed as much,3
139545.0,i think the light colored interior will help keep radiation from being absorbed because the dark colors attract radiation,2
136356.0,i picked using light colored fabric on the inside of the car i picked this because it is light colored and light colors help reflect solar radiation also the fabric will act like an insulator if some of the heat gets absorbed than the fabric will keep the heat from getting inside,4
139507.0,if laura wants to keep her car cool while it sits in the sun then it is best to avoid getting a car that has dark colors both inside and out dark colors like black absorb a lot more heat than lighter colors so that means if the car is dark inside and out it will get a lot warmer than a car than is lighter in color,3
150065.0,light colors reflect heat so she should have light colored thing inside and outside of your car,3
136367.0,i think that laura should by a light painted car and a light colored fabric because if you have a dark colored car the suns light will absorb the heat causing the inside to be warmer but if you use a light colored car the suns light will reflect the heat and the car wouldn t be so hot,5
136515.0,i think she should use light colored paint and fabric because lighter colors reflect heat unlike dark colors,3
118457.0,the light colored fabric would make solar radiation bounce off the fabric so the car will not get that hot,4
139497.0,lighter colors reflect light while darker colors absorb light using lighter colors will allow the car to remain the coolest,5
136497.0,white will reflect the heat andthe black would absorb the heat,4
136403.0,if you use light colored things in or on your car like light colored fabric on the inside of the car and light colored paint on the outside then your car will stay cool because dark colored objects absorb the suns heat and become very hot so you should use light colored objects for your car in the summer in order for your car to stay cool,2
150076.0,i think using a light colored paint on the outside is important to keep the car cool while it sits in the sun because using dark colored paint will absorb more heat than light color ones,4
136583.0,i thought this because white can reflect light instead of absorbing it,4
150061.0,i chose light colors because light colors reflects heat so if you have light colors in and on your car your car won t get so hot when it s in the sun,3
136360.0,so it reflects the suns heat,2
139490.0,darker colors are known to retain heat more than lighter colors which could apply to cars as well,2
118391.0,light colored fabric can reflect the sun light fact if you wear something that is a dark color it will absorb heat and won t let it escape,5
118408.0,the liter it is the less the sun atrks,2
139525.0,the light colored fabric inside of the car will not absorb as much heat as the dark colored fabric on the inside of the car,3
139487.0,using dark colored fabric on the inside of the car will absorb the heat more that is being emitted,2
136481.0,since dark colours like black navy blue and ect make things hotter by attracting heat people can change that by using light colours to reflect heat,2
136406.0,sence light colars dont atrack heat and solor radiation as much as dark colars if the car had light colars in the inside out it could be less hot,2
118488.0,it will work because the dark fabric like black will eat the sunlight thing and light colored fabric like yellow wont,3
139855.0,darker objects or colors absorbs more heat so the more light the object absorbs lighter colors reflects heat,5
136494.0,i said using a light colored paint on the outside of the car because then the car will reflect the light from going inside the car,4
118465.0,light colors have very high reflectivity so they wouldn t absorb as much solar radiation,5
136363.0,because the light colored paint would deflect some of the heat and the light colored fabric would help deflect some more,3
118355.0,the heat reflects the light,3
136485.0,i choosed this for my answer because if you use dark fabric it will mostly contain and absorb the heat because when me an my teammates tested our solar oven our black paper was getting hotter when the foil reflected the light to our solar oven,3
139787.0,light colored paint on the outside cause the color wont absorb that much heat than the darker colors,3
139493.0,by using light colors on the inside and the outside it is able to reflect more light because it reflects more light it causes the temperature of the car to be cooler,4
136495.0,it would be best for her to use all light colors because the light will reflect off of it if she use dark colors her car would absorb all heat and it would be extremely hot inside and on the outside of her car,5
139543.0,this is because since white absorbs the least amount of heat the outside color would still make a difference but the inside is what really matters because the air is trapped inside with no opening,3
139481.0,when using a light colored paint and fabric it is not absorbing as much heat as a car with black paint and fabric,3
118356.0,the light colors reflect heat and light but when dark colors absorb heat and light,5
118484.0,i did this because if it is hot light reflexs off of stuff,4
153844.0,i think it would have to be a light color because dark colors attrack and absorb heat so maybe a light color would do the oppisite,3
153852.0,we chose the first answer because bright light reflects and it keeps the car from heating up,3
139479.0,darker colors absorb larger amounts of energy from the sun,4
150077.0,light colors don t absorb much heat unlike dark colors that do the light colors will prevent the sun from heating up too much,4
136372.0,she should use a dark colored car and a dark fabric on the inside because a dark colored car will keep the heat in and will not bounce off another car which will bring more heat in and if she used a light colored fabric on the inside the heat would bounce of the seat making the car hotter,2
139819.0,using a light colored paint makes it so it doesn t absorb as much heat from the sun in comparison to dark colors,2
118590.0,light paint reflects sunlight,4
139855.0,she should use a light color because dark colors absorbs more heat than lighter colors they get the most heat light colors reflect heat from the sun which is why light colored clothes help us cool when its hot sunny,2
136553.0,because darker things adsorb and will get hotter and lighter things don t adsorb they reflect so if it reflect the sun light then it won t get hot,5
136419.0,since color is light and light comes from the sun the more color something reflects the the cooler it is so if she uses a light color paint and light color fabric the car will be cooler,3
153852.0,i chose black because it wont reflect and there is going to be no bright light inside the car and white will reflect and will make the sun come towards the car even more,3
150101.0,i chose using light colored fabric inside of the car because dark colored fabric is attracting heat but she doesn t want the car to be hot so the light colored fabric would deflect the heat from going inside the car,3
118544.0,because darker colors absorb more heat the lighter the color the cooler it stays,3
153916.0,lighter colors reflect heat and don t absorb heat,4
136392.0,the lighter the color is the less hotter it will get since dark colors absorb more heat you ll want to have light colors for your car,3
118298.0,the light colored paint on the outside will reflect the heat back out from the car also with the light colored fabric inside but if there was dark colored fabric and paint it will absorb the heat in the car,4
136572.0,light colers dont absorb the suns energy but black does,4
136457.0,light colors reflect reflects sunlight and they don t absorb much heat compared to dark colors they absorb a lot of heat and sunlight so using light colors would probably but still your car is a hunk of metal still going to heat up unless you find a tree to hind under,5
150128.0,since light colors reflect heat it would be important to have light colored elements in the car,3
136416.0,because heats bounces off light colors so the car absorbeds less heat to the car,4
154214.0,keeping the whole car light and shiny reflects the sun s rays away from the car,4
136546.0,dark colored material has more albedo than a light colored material black or dark material would get hotter with the amount of albedo content in it,2
139809.0,if the colors are lighter than light will reflect and be less likely to be absorbed as heat,5
118411.0,if you used dark colored items they would absorb the heat,3
118307.0,because light colors absorb less heat,3
139875.0,dark attracts more energy and heat than light color does,2
139526.0,to keep her car cool laura should use a light colored fabric because it won t absorb as much heat and reflect the light rays coming from the sun,4
150123.0,i choose the light colored ones because the dark ones attract heat and absorbs it,3
149964.0,she should use light colored paint on the inside and outside of her car because it will attract less sunlight,3
153818.0,light colored material reflect more light an energy than dark colored materials,4
118366.0,the light cover will reflect the solar radiation,4
154153.0,so the sun light will reflect,4
136503.0,these two choices reflect light and doesn t absorbs it,3
153839.0,if you have a dark color on he inside and outside of our car it will attract the car and absorb the heat,3
139871.0,lighter colored fabric on the inside of the car helps it to contract and if using dark colors the heat absorbs,4
136359.0,if you have a light colored paint on the outside your car will reflect heat instead of absorbing heat and if you have a light colored fabric inside your car the fabric won t get super hot,3
139506.0,since we are talking about the inside of the car we don t want to know about the outside material since using a light fabric is best because it reflects the most light and it also doesn t let the air particles heat up,4
136366.0,white has a higher albeodo than black because white reflects light while black exorbes it so when you have black fabric in your car the seats will be super hot so thats why you should have whiite fabric and a white paint,4
136492.0,i think she should use a light colored paint outside the car because a lighter color reflects the sun s radiation and bounces off the car,4
153909.0,light colors in general reflect the suns radiation back to the sun but dark colors do the opposite they attract heat that s why she need a light color paint and cloth rather then a dark paint and cloth,4
136355.0,i chose to use a light colored paint on the outside and a light colored fabric on the inside of the car if you chose a light colored fabric all the colors will reflect it so it will be less hot,3
139800.0,light colored paint will absorb less heat because it reflects light waves from the sun unlike using dark colors that absorb heat and will cause the car to warm up,5
136489.0,well since the light colors reflect the heat won t absorb it will reflect the heat out to the outside,3
139876.0,because using a light colored paint on the outside helps the car to reflect the sun s heat therefore it won t be absorbed a,3
154208.0,dark colors would not let in as much solar radiation as lighter colors would because it would be harder for solar energy to pass through dark colors,3
139488.0,dark colored fabric absorbs heat while light colored fabric reflects heat,4
136382.0,light colors reflect more light than darker colors making the object not absorb as much heat so if she uses light fabrics and paints more heat will be reflected making the car cooler,4
139521.0,light colored paint reflect most of the electromagnetic waves which mean it absorb less radiation from the sun this mean it absorb less heat,5
136576.0,i say that you use a light color paint on the outside and a light color for the fabric because dark colors attract heat and get hot very fast but if you use light colors they are known to reflect sun mostly and don t get as hot as fast as dark colors do,2
139523.0,using a light colored fabric on the inside and outside of the the car would help the most because the light color paint would help reflect some the solar radiation outside and inside the car in addition the light color does not give out as much radiation as the darker colors which would help keeps her dogs cool,4
6971.0,when its a hot day you would like to wear white because it keeps you cooler because the white is a more lighter color if you wear black the sun will reflect and make you hotter that is why i choose using a light colored paint on the outside,2
136390.0,i think that she should use the light colored paint one the outside and the light colored fabric on the inside because dark colors absorb colors heat and light and the light colors reflect the light and heat,4
150122.0,i chose light colored car paint and light colored fabric because light colors ubsorb less heat,3
136364.0,the light colors will reflect more light because the closer the color is to white the more the color will reflect keeping the car cooler inside,4
118394.0,the light colors don t absorb heat dark colors like black make it hotter in the car because it absorbs heat,3
139769.0,the lighter colors will not absorb heat as much,3
154303.0,i think using a light colored paint on the outside will help it to make it cool because light colors don t attract the heat but with a dark color for example the color black since black is a dark color it absorbs more heat,3
118549.0,i think that she should us a light colored paint because the dark colored paint will absorb the heat,3
118452.0,i think that it is the right choice to put a lighter color paint on the outside because dark colors obsorb the sun,3
139819.0,light colors reflect light more than dark colors,4
150199.0,dark would not work because the sun is attracted to dark colors not light colors so the sun will bounce off the light colors,3
136425.0,laura should use light colors because it doesn t absorb heat it reflects it if she were to use black it would absorb heat and it would be hot,4
136424.0,if it is light it will reflect more light keeping it cool,4
150161.0,i reflects the sun,3
118401.0,light colors don t absorb as much energy from the sun as you can with dark colors,4
151199.0,using light colored paint because dark colors absorb heat but if it is lihgt it wont abosorb,3
136517.0,i think this because the light colored fabric pushes all the heat away and doesn t take any and absorb it,3
139808.0,i know she should get a light color car because if she were to get a dark color car the dark color will absorb more sun light and make the temp of the car increase,4
136380.0,darker colors absorb the light so it will make her car hotter lighter colors reflect the light making her car cooler so if she does not want her car to be hot then choose the lighter colors,5
118544.0,the darker the color the more heat it absorbs so the hotter it gets and the lighter the color the color it gets so the car wont get to hot on the inside if its a lighter color on the inside,3
118480.0,i think its important to have light paint on the outside because the it will make it reflect off the car if it were dark paint it would attract the sun instead of reflect it,2
139505.0,a light colored fabric paint reflects more sunlight and the energy that comes along with it,4
