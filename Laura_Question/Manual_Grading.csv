118585.0,because it will reflect the light back into the sun,2
118544.0,the darker the color the more heat it absorbs so the hotter it gets and the lighter the color the color it gets so the car wont get to hot on the inside if its a lighter color on the inside,3
118544.0,because darker colors absorb more heat the lighter the color the cooler it stays,3
151223.0,the sun and heat bounces off of light things as for dark things the heat is absorbed making it hot,4
154211.0,dark things heat up faster and absorb it light things do that but at a much slower pace and don t get as got,3
136407.0,light colors absorb more heat than dark colors,2
118534.0,because if you use a light colored paint the suns solar heat will bleed through the light color paint while the dark color will not have heat pouring through,2
139478.0,darker colors such as black absorb the heat and sunlight more efficiently so it would cause laura s car to become hotter that is why using a lighter color paint for her care would be more efficinent because lighter colors reflect light and heat off better,5
150089.0,i chose a and c because they both represent light colors i know that light colors reflect the sun and dark colors obsorb the sun,4
139854.0,nan,1
153925.0,well if it is black it will absorbe the heat,3
136363.0,because the light colored paint would deflect some of the heat and the light colored fabric would help deflect some more,3
154194.0,i chose this answer because the dark color paint will only make the metal hot on the outside when you have light color fabric on the inside the energy will come in through the glass but the fabric will not absorb as much energy as the dark fabric or paint and the energy would just bounce out of the car,5
150112.0,light colers bounce the light right off,4
118466.0,light things reflect heat and dark things attract heat,3
150109.0,she should use a light colored paint on the outside because if you use a light colored paint it will reflect the heat,3
139508.0,the sun s rays provide heat energy through radiation using the same principles as light since these are electromagnetic waves we know that the light will be able to penetrate through the car especially on the windows because they are made of glass and are transparent allowing the light to go through light colors reflect light whereas dark colors absorb light meaning that the light colors are reflecting heat energy from the electromagnetic waves and the dark colors are absorbing them making the interior hotter through conduction the light colors in the inside of the car will help keep the car cool because it provides another layer of protection in a way where the fabric can help reflect the light that is able to penetrate through the car s exterior,5
139841.0,light colored fabric would allow for less radiation absorption,4
150072.0,i chose light colored objects because the sun doesn t go on light colored objects often,2
136507.0,light colors absorb less heat than dark ones this would cause the heat from the sun to be less effective in heating the car overall,2
139775.0,light colors reflect the sun unlike dark colors which absorb the sun,4
150122.0,i chose light colored car paint and light colored fabric because light colors ubsorb less heat,3
118583.0,because when you sit down your legs will not get burnt and light colors dont absorb that much heat,3
136480.0,because it s like if you wear dark closet you get hot like black closet so for it s the same for cars as well the reason why is because like dark colors has a low albedo and absorbs a lot of light and light colors are the same but it doesn t absorb it reflects,4
118313.0,light colored fabric takes less sunlight,3
150163.0,because light colored things reflect heat,3
139477.0,the light color paint and fabric will not absorb as much light as a dark color fabric,4
150076.0,i think using a light colored paint on the outside is important to keep the car cool while it sits in the sun because using dark colored paint will absorb more heat than light color ones,4
136415.0,color bounces light easily,2
118315.0,i agree with my choice because for example light reflects off of light colors like white or lighter colors where as colors like black take in light making it heated,4
136515.0,i think laura should use light colored paint and light colored fabric for her car because white reflects and black absorbs,4
154319.0,i beleive this because darker colered things absorb more radiation from the sun and i know that becuse i have read it in science articles and been told off my brother went to osu,4
139851.0,nan,1
151192.0,i have heard that lighter colors don t absorb as much heat and therefore it wouldn t be as hot,3
150124.0,darker things absorb heat will lighter colored things dont atract heat,4
150245.0,i chose this because the lighter the paint the less heat it will absorb,3
139528.0,if you use a dark color more heat will be attracted to the car this is because black does not reflect light meaning that it will absorb the heat while white reflects all the color light that is coming from the sun,2
153864.0,you should use the light colerd choices because they don t absorb heat where if you have a dark colerd car it will absorb heat,3
118513.0,using light colored paint and fabric wont absorb heat as will using dark colored paint,3
154914.0,she should use light colored materials because it reflects the light when dark colors absorb it and make it hotter,5
136520.0,one scientific theory suggests that lighter tones of color absorb less light than dark tones of color,3
136391.0,i chose light color fabric because the darker the fabric like black the light can not reflect making it hot,4
139482.0,a light colored paint job would reflect the sunlight meaning the car would not absorb the heat,5
139863.0,using a dark color such as black will absorb more heat rather than using a lighter color which will reflect the heat,4
118482.0,because,2
136404.0,i belive painting the car a light color and having light colored fabric inside the car reduces heat because white or a light color reflects all light and solar energy so laura s car can stay cooler,4
118440.0,you should use light colors because when you use light colors the sun reflects off of the car if your car is dark the sun will atract it and it will heat your car up,3
139517.0,the light colored paint will reflect the light from the sun better leading to the light from the sun having a harder time to enter the car making it cooler,4
118521.0,the fabric will reflect the light and heat away from the car to keep it cool and same with the paint i would use a light fabric over the car,4
150085.0,i chose these answers because i have learned previously that light fabrics or materials don t absorb as much heat as dark colored fabrics,3
154109.0,i choice light color for the inside fabric and the outside paint because if you use light color it will reflect the sun but if you use dark colors it will absorb the sun,4
136467.0,using light colors means the colors reflect the sun if you chose darker colors the colors will absorb the suns heat,4
153832.0,the light fabric makes the seat reflect the sun and not absorb it,4
150148.0,i choose light things because the sun just beams off of light clothes dark clothes soak up all the heat,4
154126.0,i choose my answer because the dark fabric will shade out the sunlight,3
139881.0,nan,1
153852.0,i chose black because it wont reflect and there is going to be no bright light inside the car and white will reflect and will make the sun come towards the car even more,3
150230.0,sun and heat reflect of light colors,3
141561.0,i picked this because if you have light colors on the outside you will have less heat trapped in the car because it will reflect the heat if you us light paint it reflects the heat from the outside also making it cooler,3
136417.0,light colors are better because it will reflect the brightness of it,3
154195.0,first of all dark colors attract sunlight so the and answers would not work secondly light colors repel heat energy the answer must be or i think it is one because that would allow the heat to not enter in the first place if the dark colored paint on the outside attract the heat by the time it wants to escape because of the light seats it would already be trapped,3
139543.0,this is because since white absorbs the least amount of heat the outside color would still make a difference but the inside is what really matters because the air is trapped inside with no opening,3
136461.0,the light would be reflected only making the outside of the car hotter and the inside just fine,4
150092.0,dark reflects,2
118484.0,i did this one because light reflect the light and dark odserb,4
136389.0,laura wants to make her car cooler on a hot day if she wants to do this the light colored paint and and fabric is what she should use the light colored paint and fabric will have more white in it and the white reflects the sun the heat and solar radiation will not go into the car but it will reflect it away if she used the dark colored paint and fabric it would absorb the solar radiation making the car warmer and that is not what she wants to do,5
153983.0,i say light colored fabric because black attracts the heat and heat bounces off of light colors,3
154135.0,because it will stop the heat longer because it is thicker than the white color fabric so it will reflect,2
136553.0,because darker things adsorb and will get hotter and lighter things don t adsorb they reflect so if it reflect the sun light then it won t get hot,5
139855.0,she should use a light color because dark colors absorbs more heat than lighter colors they get the most heat light colors reflect heat from the sun which is why light colored clothes help us cool when its hot sunny,2
118614.0,i chose those answers because if you have a dark colored car and lets say leather seat your car is automatically absorbing heat from the sun which makes your car hot,2
139544.0,using light colored paint and fabric outside the car inside allows heat to be reflected rather than it being absorbed,4
136406.0,sence light colars dont atrack heat and solor radiation as much as dark colars if the car had light colars in the inside out it could be less hot,2
118344.0,i chose a light colored fabric because the light fabric dose not obsorb the sun as much as the dark fabric,3
118457.0,the light colored fabric would make solar radiation bounce off the fabric so the car will not get that hot,4
136424.0,if it is light it will reflect more light keeping it cool,4
118308.0,if you have dark leather in side like black it makes your car hotter cause black leather attracts sunlight,3
136411.0,if you use a light color everything inside and out you are hoping that the heat will reflect and not absorb the light and heat,4
150242.0,the bright colors reflect heat while dark ones absorb more heat,4
153928.0,i decided to pick those choices because i learned that darker color will attract more radiation ad heat that will create hot convection inside,3
150215.0,if you have bright coler car it will reflect,3
139739.0,these arre important because if the color is lighter then it reflects the sun a lot better and doesn t absorb as much heat as the darker colors,4
154107.0,doing a light colored paint on the outside and inside because dark colors attracts heat while light color reflects heat,3
150060.0,heat soaks into darker colors,3
118448.0,the darker the color the more heat it absorbs and the lighter the color the more heat it reflects so a light colored fabric and paint would make the car cooler than a dark colored fabric and paint,4
139830.0,black cars tend to attract more sunlight and rise in temperature on the inside and outside of the car so switching to a lighter colored paint would make this not possible,2
136456.0,since lighter colors have a high albedo the ability to reflect light the car would reflect the heat with lighter color fabric and paint,4
118601.0,light colors reflect light so a light colored paint might help,3
153917.0,i think this because the light color don t prevent heat and dark colors do and i also think the light colored fabric will work also because it won t burn your behind,2
136379.0,the lighter the it reflects light which makes heat go down,3
136456.0,if she uses light colored fabric on the outside of her car the fabric will reflect the heat from the light keeping the car cool,3
139508.0,dark colors tend to absorb heat and using light colors would help reflect some of the electromagnetic radiation penetrating through the car s windows if more radiation is being reflected then that means that more infrared radiation is being reflected too,5
136485.0,because if it s light colored it might basically not get your car to hot and might reflect back to the sun because of the light color,3
139769.0,dark colors absorb heat more than light colors using light colors will help reflect the light away from the car and the heat,5
118471.0,light colored things reflect heat and darker things absorb heat,4
139483.0,the light colored fabric will reflect the solar radiation more and therefore allows less chance for the car to absorb the the radiation and warm up,5
139513.0,using a light colored fabric on the inside of the car will absorb less heat than that off a darker colored,3
153843.0,dark atracts more sun light because dark atracts more sun light,3
136351.0,i is useful to use bright colors on the inside and outside of the car because they will reflect off the color but if it was dark the color would absorb the heat and it would go anywhere causing the car to get hotter,4
139774.0,using a light color will keep the car cool while it sits in the sun because darker colors make it hot and darker colors absorbs more heat while light colors helps us cool when its hot,3
118412.0,because having a dark colored painted car atracts more sunlight as well as dark colored fabric,3
118362.0,nan,1
118304.0,dark colors absorb heat and light colors deflect heat so it is wise to have a light colored car to keep it cool,3
136502.0,i think so because according to albedo heat reflects off of light colored things and dark colors aborcs heat,4
136419.0,since color is light and light comes from the sun the more color something reflects the the cooler it is so if she uses a light color paint and light color fabric the car will be cooler,3
139840.0,darker colors absorbs more heat faster,3
154330.0,light fabric on the car because the sun will reflect off of it also keeping the light fabric inside the car is better so it does not go in the c,3
118393.0,my choices where to use a light color inside and outside because it doesn t obsorb as much as a dark color,3
139494.0,using a dark colored fabric on the inside of the car will keep the car cool because dark colors attract more heat so the fabric will absorb all the heat from the sun when it hits the car,2
154134.0,i said those were my chooses because sun rays are attracted to darker colored objects rather than lighter colored objects,3
150220.0,the darker material receives more radiation than the white material,3
139880.0,nan,1
150172.0,i chose light colors cause dark colors absorb heat,3
118393.0,i said for my answer using a light color fabric on the inside of the car because if you have a dark color fabric it will take in the heat of the sun even more than a light color fabric,2
139489.0,using light colored fabric on the inside of the car will cause the inside of the car to have a higher reflectivity i saw in one of the wise activity that having a higher reflectivity will lower the temperature because it cause more radiation to be bounced off the surface,4
139495.0,the light colors will cause the light to be reflected whereas dark colors will absorb the light causing the light energy to turn into heat,5
139525.0,the light colored fabric inside of the car will not absorb as much heat as the dark colored fabric on the inside of the car,3
136422.0,i think she should us a light colored paint on the outside of her car because if her car is black heat absorbs into black and if its white heat reflects,4
150153.0,light colors don t obsorb heat as well as dark colors,4
118444.0,the light colored fabric will partially reflect the heat away from the car,3
118454.0,lighter colors reflect the sun away,3
136480.0,the reason why because of albedo albedo is for an example if you have a dark color on it gets extremely hot because darker colors absorbs more heat than lighter colors,3
118401.0,light colors don t obsorb as much light as the dark colors,4
136414.0,i chose those things because white reflects the sun,3
136420.0,the light colors will reflect most but the darker colors will absorb most,4
118577.0,because light fabric reflects light,4
118593.0,if the paint and fabric is light colored the car wont heat up as much,2
149970.0,light colors don t attract sun light,2
154327.0,the light paint fabric will reflect off the sun s heat,3
139828.0,we would use light color on the outside because it would reflect it out instead of absorbing it and the dark color inside would trap the temperature inside,4
150069.0,you would need a light colored car because dark colors attract and absorb heat i know this because my dads car is always outside on the seats are dark colored it is always hot when you get in,3
118579.0,it will because it reflects light and heat,3
136564.0,using almost anything light colored helps because light colors have a high albedo so the light reflects and goes somewhere else besides the car dark colors have low albedos and so the heat would be absorbed making the car hotter,5
118601.0,she should use a light colored paint because it will reflect all the heat off the car,3
139873.0,light colors don t absorb heat as much as the darker colors,3
118634.0,nan,1
139769.0,the lighter colors will not absorb heat as much,3
139808.0,nan,1
139481.0,when using a light colored paint and fabric it is not absorbing as much heat as a car with black paint and fabric,3
136422.0,using a light colored paint or fabric absorbs less heat than dark colored paint and fabric,3
136391.0,i think its black because light can reflect off all colors but black so if it does not reflect it would be going direct towards it and get kept there,4
150077.0,light colors prevent heat from going inside and creating conduction dark colors take the heat and seal it so that it goes inside so if your car is hot it s probably because you have dark colors on the inside and or outside,4
136583.0,i thought this because white can reflect light instead of absorbing it,4
151222.0,i think that using a dark colored fabric on the inside of the car would be best because what if it s windy out side and the fabric can fly away and if the fabric is on the inside of laura s car it wouldn t fly away and then she wouldn t have to worry about her car being hot,2
139812.0,the lighter fabric reflects the sun from hitting the car so basically it blocks heat from being moved into the car,3
139533.0,lighter colors reflect heat while darker colors absorb the heat and make the inside of the car hotter,4
139510.0,light colored items tend to reflect light more than dark colored objects which absorbs heat,5
139498.0,since light colors doesn t absorb as much heat as dark colors using a light colored fabric might be necessary to keep the car cool while it sits in the sun,3
154340.0,i chose that one because its like tin foil so it just reflect of,3
136474.0,light colors don t absorb as much heat colors as darker colors do,4
139526.0,to keep her car cool laura should use a light colored fabric because it won t absorb as much heat and reflect the light rays coming from the sun,4
136500.0,i choose these options because of albedo dark colors absorb the sun which makes the car hotter lighter colors reflect the light making the car less hot,5
149966.0,light colors do not attract sunlight as much as darker colors do,3
139816.0,light colors do not attract light energy heat as well as dark colors do so the light colored options are better for keeping the car cooler,2
139514.0,more of the sun s energy would be reflected so less light energy would be absorbed,5
139879.0,because light colored fabric will reflect the sun s rays not attract them,2
136404.0,anything light colored reflects solar energy this is called having a high albedo albedo is how much an objects reflects if laura wanted a hot car she would use black paint and black fabric because black absorbs solar energy rather than reflecting it,5
139496.0,using any dark colored items fabric or paint will absorb all the heat from the sun and everything will warm up as a result the opposite would be best to keep things cool in the sun,2
118443.0,dark colors in the sun will obsorbe the heat around it lightly colored paint fabric etc will keep the car more cooled than darkly colored paint fabric etc will,3
118539.0,tis reflects the light outwards,3
149961.0,light and light will not absorb the heat,3
150167.0,the car will reflect the sunlight and keep cool inside,4
139483.0,laura should use a light colored paint and light colored fabric inside her car because those colors tend o absorb less radiation from the sun making it harder for the car to heat up as quickly if her interior and exterior color scheme were dark,4
118469.0,the black on the inside absorbs the heat than can get in because the white outside reflects the heat away,4
139533.0,lighter colors reflect more sun rays than dark colors do so keeping everything light will allow the car to stay cooler since the heat is being reflected away,4
118345.0,this is right because this paint will reflect the heat,2
118443.0,using darkly colored paint and fabric can heat up the car because the heat can be absorbed from the darkly colored fabric or paint,3
118366.0,light colors reflect light,3
118510.0,dark colors hold more heat so if you use light colors the heat wont get absorbed as much,3
139853.0,a light colored fabric will help it cool because it won t absorb as much heat from the inside which will keep the car cool,3
118624.0,first i chose using light colored paint on the outside because dark colors can heat things up colors like black increase an object s temperature when it is is under the sun second i chose using light colored fabric on the inside because the darker the color the more the temperature will increase,2
118590.0,light paint reflects sunlight,4
118438.0,you shouldn t use anything dark because black absorbs sun if you painted your car light it would still be hot due to the material of the car the best thing to do is put a light colored fabric over the car,3
139643.0,darker colors absorb more heat so by using a lighter colored paint and fabric which absorbs less heat this will help keep the car cooler,3
136520.0,nan,1
139871.0,lighter colored fabric on the inside of the car helps it to contract and if using dark colors the heat absorbs,4
118466.0,heat bounces off of light colored things and is attracted to dark things,2
118356.0,light colored things reflects light and heat when dark colors absorb light and heat,5
154108.0,i chose using light colored fabric and using a light colored paint because when the sun rays hit the light color it won t absorb as much as it would to a dark colored one for example if its a hot day and you re wearing a light colored shirt such as white it wont be as hot but if you wear a dark colored shirt such as black it will be very hot so when the sun rays go through the car windows it won t absorb the fabric as long as it is a light color,4
118318.0,nan,1
150059.0,it will help heat reflect off,3
136558.0,because dark colors make it hotter and light colors are less absorbent,2
136369.0,if she chose a dark color like black its going to absorb lot of heat causing the car to get very hot if she used a light color like white it would reflect most of the heat causing the car not to get to hot,4
136368.0,the light colors will reflect the heat outside of the car to make it colder when it reflects the heat will not stay inside the car,3
