150128.0,light colors reflect heat so the car would stay cooler on the inside because it would reflect the suns rays,4
136475.0,i choose using a light colored paint on the outside and using light colored fabric on the inside of the car because the darker the color it is it will be hotter,2
136372.0,she should use a dark colored car and a dark fabric on the inside because a dark colored car will keep the heat in and will not bounce off another car which will bring more heat in and if she used a light colored fabric on the inside the heat would bounce of the seat making the car hotter,2
118543.0,i chose that because the light color will reflect the heat but the dark colored will observed the heat and it will cause to heat up,4
136362.0,the light color on the outside will reflect the heat the darker the object the warmer it is if the light is on the outside it will reflect outside so it will not reach inside the car,3
136460.0,a darker color would have absorbed most of the heat yet with a lighter colored paint the heat would be able to reflect off the paint if it would have absorbed the heat the car would be much more hot than the light colored car,4
150899.0,i choose my answer because heat bounces off the light colors instead of dark colors because dark colors absorb heat,5
139747.0,light fabric because weather forecaster advise people to wear a light shirts if its too hot because it is very reflective and does not absorb heat,4
139536.0,light colored paint and fabric reflect radiation more than dark colored paint and fabric the less radiation is absorbed the less heat will be inside of the car,4
153916.0,lighter colors reflect heat and don t absorb heat,4
136567.0,i chose this because the the dark stuff will absorbs all the heat,3
136412.0,the lighter color your car has the less color it obsorbs and the less color the car obsorbs the less heat it has,2
150134.0,i chose the light colored seats and car because if you have black seating it obsorbs the heat,3
118439.0,dark attracts heat and light color reflects,3
153830.0,use light colored fabric and paint because dark fabric and dark paint will absorb heat which will make the car really hot,3
150174.0,the light paint will deflect the heat,3
118536.0,dark colors absorb the heat energy making it hotter,4
150155.0,well darker things trap all the heat so you want lighter things if you want to keep your car cool,3
118517.0,light dosnt attract heat but dark like black does attract heat,2
150167.0,light will reflect heat,3
153837.0,i would want lighter colored paint and fabric because darker colors will absorb the heat and lighter colors will reflect the heat instead of absorbing it,4
139522.0,since dark colors absorb heat it would be best to use a light colored fabric in addition using fabric can help block the sunlight,3
118437.0,light keeps the reflects the sun,3
118372.0,if the color of the car is light then the heat will reflect and keep the inside cool,3
150207.0,the light colors will prevent the heat from absorbing,3
139870.0,with a lighter color like white the sun reflects its heat away more efficiently than with a darker color like black which absorbs heat,2
118480.0,i think its important to have light paint on the outside because the it will make it reflect off the car if it were dark paint it would attract the sun instead of reflect it,2
136395.0,since white has a high albedo it will reflect most of the sunlight that hitsit therefore the white colors on the car will help keep the car cool because there will be very little heat absorbed,4
136361.0,black adsorbs and white reflects so light cloth must reflect the heat,4
150144.0,black attracts heat so if she doesn t want her car to heat up she can use light colors and light fabrics,2
118415.0,i chose these answers because light colors like white or sky blue don t attract or absorb much sunlight,3
136515.0,i think laura should use light colored paint and light colored fabric for her car because white reflects and black absorbs,4
150245.0,i chose this because the lighter the paint the less heat it will absorb,3
139768.0,lighter colors bounce light off while darker absorbs the heat making it hotter,4
118598.0,i think she should us light colors because it attracts less sunlight and heat,3
154325.0,using black fabric and paint will make the car hotter the color will absorb heat quicker if it is a dark color because it is dark and dark colors don t deflect heat as well as light colors do light colors will deflect heat more because of their brightness,4
139823.0,light colored materials would not absorb as much heat as dark colored materials,3
154311.0,if you put the fabric pn the car it prevents the heat gose in side and dark fabric is much better because is not going to reflect,2
118557.0,by using light colored paint on the outside it will reflect off more heat than a dark colored paint that will just absorb the heat by using a light colored fabric on the inside of the car it will also reflect off more heat than a dark colored fabric would,4
149961.0,light and light will not absorb the heat,3
136380.0,the darker a color is the closer it is to black black absorbs the heat so her car will be hotter if you have a white or lighter color your car may still be hot according to the temperature but it won t be as hot as a black car have seats that are a light color help make it cooler because it won t absorb the heat,3
139861.0,the lighter color does not absorbs as much light heat compared to a dark color,4
118619.0,light color don t absorb as much heat as darker color do so if her car has lighter colored car it won t won t get as hot as a darker colored car,3
150077.0,light colors don t absorb much heat unlike dark colors that do the light colors will prevent the sun from heating up too much,4
136505.0,i chose a and c because since white has a low albedo the white reflects off the sun and there will be not a lot of heat in the car where as black has a high albedo and would attract the sun therefore making the car hotter,2
139643.0,light color absorbs less heat thus the car will be cooler,3
150172.0,i chose light colors cause dark colors absorb heat,3
118452.0,light color does not absorb the sun dark colors do,3
118456.0,i picked light colored paint and fabric because light colors reflect off the sun and dark colors attracts the heat,3
136522.0,i think using light colored fabric in the inside of the car is most important to keep the car not too hot because then it won t absorb a lot of heat and laura will probably want the inside of the car to kep cool and will not care very much about the outside being hot,3
136520.0,one scientific theory suggests that lighter tones of color absorb less light than dark tones of color,3
150108.0,hit was c,1
150054.0,light colored objects can reflect the light or keep it from getting warm,4
136417.0,light colors are better because it will reflect the brightness of it,3
139492.0,light colored materials do not absorb as much heat as the dark colored materials,3
136503.0,the light colored objects reflect heat so less heat is obsorbed there for the car dosen t get to hot,3
149972.0,having two layers of light colored things will let minimal heat in any heat that gets in won t get absorbed into the car because there is light colored fabric,3
153982.0,black collects heat so it is good to have a light colored fabric in the inside of the car,2
139544.0,using light colored paint and fabric outside the car inside allows heat to be reflected rather than it being absorbed,4
151217.0,i do not know,1
154306.0,white and light colors will reflect most of the sunlight from going in the car,4
118592.0,i am going to with light colored on the outside and also the inside because the light color wont atract the sun if you use the dark color you are making the suns heat go inside your car that is why i would use light colors in the inside and the outside the car,2
150168.0,why i chose the light colored answers is because light colored objects reflect the sun and does not heat up,3
118456.0,i picked light colored paint and fabric because the sun reflects off of light colors and darker colors attract the heat,3
118343.0,it should be a light color outside the car like white because light colors don t absorb the heat like dark colors do,3
154318.0,it is,1
150202.0,using light colors will not absorb the heat,4
136571.0,light colered things reflect most light,4
139538.0,darker colors absorb light more so than light colors so having a light colored paint on the outside will absorb less of the sunlight,4
139498.0,since light colors doesn t absorb as much heat as dark colors using a light colored fabric might be necessary to keep the car cool while it sits in the sun,3
136366.0,white has a higher albeodo than black because white reflects light while black exorbes it so when you have black fabric in your car the seats will be super hot so thats why you should have whiite fabric and a white paint,4
150069.0,you would need a light colored car because dark colors attract and absorb heat i know this because my dads car is always outside on the seats are dark colored it is always hot when you get in,3
150917.0,the sun s radiation is attracted to darker colors the car would get hotter if it had dark colors the car will still get hot with light colors but if you had darker colors the car would be really hot,3
139769.0,dark colors absorb heat more than light colors using light colors will help reflect the light away from the car and the heat,5
149972.0,light colored paint will prevent most heat form entering the car because it s reflective dark colored fabric on the inside will let the heat escape more easily than light colored fabric,3
139862.0,dark colors retain heat more well than lighter colors,3
150900.0,so it reflects off of the car,3
154304.0,i chose this because dark colors trap heat so you don t want them in your car,2
136405.0,i chose this because the dark paint would take in the sun s heat and the car would get hot with the lighter paint it will reflect more heat than absorb it this same things goes for the fabric,2
150059.0,it will help heat reflect off,3
118350.0,my choices are the best answers because lighter colors attract less light and darker colors attract more light this happens because to make black the color absorbs all colors and doesnt let any out and white reflects all light to make it look white and therefore less hot,5
136384.0,light colors reflect the sun s rays whereas dark colors absorb it,5
149959.0,because if we used dark colored fabric it will absorb light and make the car hotter,4
150167.0,the car will reflect the sunlight and keep cool inside,4
136502.0,i think so because according to albedo heat reflects off of light colored things and dark colors aborcs heat,4
139875.0,dark attracts more energy and heat than light color does,2
139538.0,since black colored objects absorb heat better the lighter colored objects would help decrease the amount of heat being absorbed allowing the car to become less hotter,3
153822.0,i think lighter things work better because dark fabrics and dark objects tend to pick up more heat andd get hotter,2
118484.0,i did this one because light reflect the light and dark odserb,4
139790.0,all these light colored material will help bounce back the solar radiation,4
136576.0,i say that you use a light color paint on the outside and a light color for the fabric because dark colors attract heat and get hot very fast but if you use light colors they are known to reflect sun mostly and don t get as hot as fast as dark colors do,2
136379.0,the lighter the it reflects light which makes heat go down,3
136576.0,i think this will help keep her car cool because if she were to have dark colors it would heat up faster because black absorbs all colors of heat but if she were to paint it white or some other light color it will reflect the sun or absorb tiny bits of thus causing her car to be cool,4
150170.0,i think she should use a light colored fabric in the car because if you used a dark colored fabric in the car it will get hot because darker colors absorb more heat,3
136489.0,well since the light colors reflect the heat won t absorb it will reflect the heat out to the outside,3
154194.0,i chose this answer because the dark color paint will only make the metal hot on the outside when you have light color fabric on the inside the energy will come in through the glass but the fabric will not absorb as much energy as the dark fabric or paint and the energy would just bounce out of the car,5
118622.0,the darker colors are the more they attract rays of sun or for instance heat if the fabric and paint on the car are light colored it would reflect heat,3
139539.0,using a dark colored paint on the outside of the car will not reflect or absorb light and so less light will travel inside the car,3
149969.0,darker colors soak up heat and get really hot,3
118525.0,light color would keep the car cooler because darkness absorbs more sunlight,4
139541.0,less heat is absorbed when the color is light and more reflection occurs if the light is light rather than dark less heat will be absorbed and therefore it will keep the car cool,4
150117.0,i picked the dark because he dark can reflect off the black fabric or paint,2
136457.0,light colored items have higher albedo so it can reflect sunlight better than dark colored item which have low albedo the lower the albedo it s more likely to absorb the sunlight and gain heat,5
153823.0,light colored fabric because the lighter the color the less energy it will absorb,4
139782.0,light color paint because darker colors attract more of the heat and light colors is less,2
154371.0,just couse,1
153918.0,since black absorbs heat i would think its beter,3
139479.0,darker colors absorb larger amounts of energy from the sun,4
136375.0,the car will be cooler because dark colord fabrics absorb the heat so if you use a light colord fabric it dose not absorb the heat therefor if will be cooler,3
118583.0,because when you sit down your legs will not get burnt and light colors dont absorb that much heat,3
136553.0,because lighter colors don t adsorb as much as darker colors so and because lighter colors do the opposite of darker colors they reflect,4
150206.0,well the light colors reflects the sun and that may help for her,3
118406.0,the light color paint out side so the solar radiation would be less likely so seep through the metal under,3
136456.0,if she uses light colored fabric on the outside of her car the fabric will reflect the heat from the light keeping the car cool,3
118473.0,becuse dark things atrack black things,2
139815.0,using lighter colors will not absorb as much radiation and heat as the darker colors would for an example black cars usually are hotter to touch then white,4
153830.0,dark colored things absorb heat so if you use a light colored thing it won t absorb heat you would use the fabric inside because it will keep the inside nice and cool because the energy won t really go through the outside of the car,4
150127.0,she should use lighter colored paint because darker colors are more likely to attract the sun more,2
136364.0,the light colors will reflect more light because the closer the color is to white the more the color will reflect keeping the car cooler inside,4
153916.0,lighter colors reflect the sunlight and will keep the car cooler,4
118394.0,the light colors don t absorb heat dark colors like black make it hotter in the car because it absorbs heat,3
139519.0,light colors reflect light so the solar radiation reflects off the cars surface preventing much of it from directly being absorbed into the car,5
118307.0,because light colors absorb less heat,3
150056.0,you want a lighter color because black atracks a lot of heat which gets hotter faster than the color white,2
139517.0,solar light reflects off of brighter colors more than darker colors so if the car is a brighter color it would help reflect some of the light,4
136499.0,she should use us light colored paint on the outside and a dark colored fabric on the inside the light colored paint wil reflect the sun s light and the dark colored fabric will absorb the heat on the inside of the car,4
139864.0,so the insides dont absorb heat but instead reflects it so that i leaves the car,4
136558.0,because dark colors make it hotter and light colors are less absorbent,2
139533.0,lighter colors reflect heat while darker colors absorb the heat and make the inside of the car hotter,4
154330.0,light fabric on the car because the sun will reflect off of it also keeping the light fabric inside the car is better so it does not go in the c,3
136456.0,since lighter colors have a high albedo the ability to reflect light the car would reflect the heat with lighter color fabric and paint,4
150200.0,i chose those because when the color is light it reflects,3
136561.0,darker colors absorb more of the light spectrum and lighter reflects almost all of the light spectrum,5
150061.0,i chose light colored fabric and light colored paint because the heat will bonce off of the car,3
136559.0,i chose light paint and dark insides because if the car still does get hot it will be absorbed by the seats and the windows hopefully wont explode,2
136408.0,light colors reflect the light dark colors absorb the light,5
118349.0,light colors don t radiate as much heat as dark cars do,2
139853.0,a light colored fabric will help it cool because it won t absorb as much heat from the inside which will keep the car cool,3
153839.0,if you have a dark color on he inside and outside of our car it will attract the car and absorb the heat,3
139775.0,light colors reflect the sun unlike dark colors which absorb the sun,4
150063.0,i chose my answer because light colors reflect heat,3
136380.0,darker colors absorb the light so it will make her car hotter lighter colors reflect the light making her car cooler so if she does not want her car to be hot then choose the lighter colors,5
139822.0,light colors do not absorb light as much as dark colors do,4
118468.0,light colored fabric makes it so you are cooler on warm days but black dark colors absorbs the heat making the car warmer,3
118366.0,light colors reflect light,3
118598.0,the light colors reflect sunlight and heat while the dark colors absorb it,5
150215.0,if you have bright coler car it will reflect,3
118321.0,if you put dark paint on the outside it will attract a lot of solar radiation and if you put light colored paint it won t attract any solar radiation do not use any dark colored fabric because it will attract a lot solar radiation and if you put light colored fabric it won t attract any solar radiation,3
118593.0,if the paint and fabric is light colored the car wont heat up as much,2
153864.0,you should use the light colerd choices because they don t absorb heat where if you have a dark colerd car it will absorb heat,3
150076.0,i think using a light colored paint on the outside is important to keep the car cool while it sits in the sun because using dark colored paint will absorb more heat than light color ones,4
136491.0,the light colored things will reflect the light and give off less heat,4
136355.0,i chose to use a light colored paint on the outside and a light colored fabric on the inside of the car if you chose a light colored fabric all the colors will reflect it so it will be less hot,3
136403.0,if you use light colored things in or on your car like light colored fabric on the inside of the car and light colored paint on the outside then your car will stay cool because dark colored objects absorb the suns heat and become very hot so you should use light colored objects for your car in the summer in order for your car to stay cool,2
118308.0,using a light colored paint will reflect more sun and a dark colored paint will absorb more sun and a light colored fabric will reflect and a dark colored fabric will absorb,4
