118296,"I think dark colors would not work because they make think more warm than light colors. I also think she should get light colored leather and not fabric because fabric stains easily, and if the stains are dark they will make the seats even warmer. I think it is more important to have a light color on the outside because it would keep the inside of the car cooler. If it had a dark outside and a light inside it would not stay as cool.

118300,I chose using using dark colored fabric inside the car because if you were a white colored shirt then you will get sunburn.The car will burn up if you put light colored fabric.,2
118302,My choice is a fabulous idea because a darker color will attract the solar heat from the sun to the car. She should also use the light colored fabric inside the car because it most likely not going to get the inside of the car hot.,2
118310,I think by using the light-color paint on the outside of the car will make the car car cooler.,2
118304,Light colors deflect heat while dark colors absorb heat.,4
118313,Light colored fabric takes less sunlight.,3
118319,because a dark color like black attract the heat but light colors like wight reflect the heat.,3
118297,Dark colors attract sun so you need light colors.,2
118298,"Well if you use dark colored paint on the outside it will be hot on the outside, if you put light colored paint on the outside it will be cold on the outside. But if you you use dark colored fabric it will make it hot on the outside, and if you use light colored fabric it will be cold on the inside.",2
118311,because the dark fabric is more thick and it can handle a lot of heat.,2
118305,"laura should use a light-colerd fabric on the inside of the car because it will keep the car not that hot durring the summer.
",2
118293,I chose these awnsers because dark colors trap heat and tend to get warmer and but light colors don't tend to do that.,2
118299,Well if you have a lighter shade of paint on your car and you were in the sun it reflect more to the sun.But if you had a darker shade then it wouldnt  ,3
118309,probraly it would cover son,2
118307,Because dark colors are heated up faster.,2
118306,using/wearing dark colored objects gets you/it more hot that is why i think laura might want to use only light colored things,2
118308,"If you have dark leather in side like black, it makes your car hotter cause black leather attracts sunlight",3
118321,"If you put a light colored paint on he outside the car because if you put black on the outside it will get warm faster,and if put light  color fabric on the inside it will stay fresh and to warm.",2
118312,Using a light colored paint on the outside will help it stay cool.,2
118318,to keep the car cool you should have a light colored fabric because it can keep the car cool and the sun cannot heat up the car.,2
118303, I think that the light-colored fabric because the color makes it cool in side of the car.   ,2
118314,becoue with a dark coler paint it wont get to haot,2
118301,I think the light colored car would be the best because dark colors attract the sun.And for a light colored fabric inside the car wouldn't attract the sun as much.Thats how I think she should keep her car cool.,2
118316, laura should use light colored fabric because that doses not attract heat as much. ,2
118320,"I chose this because the paint doesn't matter about the heat inside the car.If she uses dark colored fabric,the sun will reflect on it,then it will be very hot.So, if she uses light colored fabric it will stay a little cool in her car.",2
118294,0,1
118315,i agree with my choice because for example light reflects off of light colors like white or lighter colors where as colors like black take in light making it heated,4
118323,I belive light colors atract less sun light and darker colors atract more sunlight.,3
118482,because ,2
118478,Darker paint heats up the car faster,2
118479,the sun will not make the in side hot and there is no use to put it outside ,2
118480,"I think its important to have light paint on the outside, because the it will make it reflect off the car. If it were dark paint it would attract the sun instead of reflect it.",2
118473,becuse dark things atrack black things,2

118483,If you use light-colored fabric inside the car the Sun's heat will be reflected by the fabric.   ,2
118470,Dark colors and black will attract more heat than lighter colors.   ,2
118472,0,1
118468,Light-colored things make it so the deflect/resist heat and black/dark colors obsorb heat so you get warmer.,3
118475,Dark colors absorb and contain heat more.,3
118477,My choices were the third and first one because if you have have any dark color on your car the sun will instantly hit your car because of the colors it has same goes to the fabric.,2
118465,"Dark colors attract heat and light, making dark colored things hotter.",3
118487,light colors reflect the sun,3
118488,It will work because the dark fabric like black will eat the sunlight thing and light colored fabric like yellow wont ,3
118486,I chose that because when you were light colors you don't get as hot as you do when you were dark colors.,2
118484,I did this one because light reflect the light and dark odserb ?,4
118485,"I think it should have white colored paint because,if she used something black it would make it hotter because the white could be used as a reflector, and black could be used as a heater when its hot, that also works with t-shirts.",3
118490,i think its okay to have the car a light colored car because the dark colors like black react to the sun and make it hot inside and when its light colored like white its cool inside or it keeps it not hot,2
118467,Using light colored fabric can make the car cool because the sun goes to dark colors and gets hot.,2
118471,Light colored things reflect heat and and dark colored things absorb heat.,4
118469,The light color with reflect the heat.,3
118466,heat bounces off of light colored things and is attracted to dark things.,2
118543,you can have the light frabic inside your car so all the heat would go in there would be something blocking it,2
118515,i think it could be a lighter colored fabric because maybe  the darker the fabric is the warmer your car will get.,2
118517,"Because the darker the color is then the more hot it will be so light colors would attract the sun less. 
",2
118533,light colors don't trap as much heat as dark color. ,2
118518,The black or dark colors attract heat and contain it unlike light colors that don't attract as much heat.,2
118548,I think that you should use light colored paint because lighter colored cars seem to be colder inside that dark colored cars. ,2
118522,dark color obsorbes the heat,3
118562,i think they should use light colored paint because dark colored paint will make the car hot,2
118526,I picked this because the sun likes darker colors like black or dark blue.,2
118567,"you should use light colored paint and fabric in and out of the car,because light colored things don't absorb heat.dark colored things do,though",3
118516,I think you should use light colored paint because dark colored paint attracts more heat.,2
118521,it will keep the sun from directly hitting the car and its light colored so that the sun will not be attracted.,2
118520,"You know how football players wear black paint under their eyes,it's so the sun doesn't get in their eyes and the same method can be used for this.",2
118514,Dark colors attract more sunlight which makes it so that your car absorbs more sunlight than the cars next to you. The more sunlight that your car absorbs the hotter the interior will get.,4
118512,Light colors attract less heat.,2
118509,The sun is attracted to dark colors and you are trying to keep the inside cool so you would use light colors so the sun won't be attracted to it.,2
118534,because if you use a light colored paint the suns solar heat will bleed through the light color paint while the dark color will not have heat pouring through,2
118519,because with the inside of the car will get really hot and in the outside the color would change over the summer,2
118511,well if you choose a light color for a car it might not get so hot because if you choose a dark colored car it might heat up faster and stay really hot.,2
118542,I think iou use light colored paint and fabric inside the car then it won't attrack to much heat because black color,2
118537,I think Laura should use a light-colored paint on the outside because it will not get to hot because the color on the outside won't let it get hot cause the color isn't dark.,2
118529,I think that she should use the light colored fabric because if it was a dark color the sun would obsorve the color and with a light color it won't have a lot to obsorve. ,3
118536,"Dark attracts heat and warms the car, so with bright colors, it's the opposite.",2
118523,so it wont heat up as fast as darked color one,2
118530,"i think she should paint the car dark, so if theres dark lights it will be cool inside the car i think..",2
118510,"Dark colors like black or navy blue hold more heat. If you use light colors it will hold less heat. Like on a hot day when you are wearing black, its hotter than when wearing white.",2
118513,Dark colors attract too much heat.,2
118556,Getting the light color things will help not getting the car so hot because the dark colored things attract the heat and the light colored thing do not.,2
118549,i think that that dark colored fabric because the fabric will block the from hit the car with heat there for the car will stay cool,2
118607,"dark colors absorbs more light and heat than lighter colors which reflect light and heat more. since lighter colors reflect heat and light more, using lighter colors will keep her car cool",5
118622,"The darker colors are the more they attract rays of sun or for instance, heat.If the fabric and paint on the car are light colored it would reflect heat. ",3
118604,dark colors absorb heat where as lighter colors reflect heat,3
118614,i chose this answer because if the fabric is darker than the sun if will make it cooler.,2
118628,"Dark colors attract the heat, but light colors repel the heat.",2
118632,0,1
118602,i chose light colored paint because if the car was a dark colored pain like black it would attract the light and the car would heat up faster.,3
118600,Light colors reflect and dark colors colect.,3
118623,She should choose light colored paint because the sun is attracted to dark colors.,2
118613,dark colors attract heat and light colors dont attract heat but reflect it,3
118610,"well,the darker the color is the more heat it obsorbs ",3
118618,"I think that if it is a really hot day, then it would be best to have a light colored car because black absorbs heat. I think the same for the fabric inside of the car.",3
118626," I think that because if it is light-colored paint it will let the sunshine pass through the car and make it more hot, and the dark-colored will not let the sunshine pass through the car.",2
118621,0,1
118611,0,1
118606,dark colors attract heat ,2
118620,because dark fabrics attract sun.,2
118616,I choice light colored fabric because the light color wont effect the sun as much as a dark shade would.,2
118601,Light colors reflect light so a light colored paint might help.,3
118615,I choose that answer because that is going to help the car from getting hot.,2
118624,0,1
118634,0,1
118609,well the fabric will be blocking the heat,2
118612,porque cubre y protege,2
118947,0,1
118344,I chose the light covered fabric because dack stuff absorb the light and heat it up more.,4
118337,I picked my answer because I know that dark colors attract and light colors repel.,2
118358,"Because the sun only puts to much heat on dark things not light things.
",2
118350,My choices are the best answers because lighter colors attract less light and darker colors attract more light. This happens because to make black the color absorbs all colors and doesnt let any out and white reflects all light to make it look white and therefore less hot.,5
118353,I think that because dark colors hold in heat that is why people say do not wear black on a hot day.,2
118346,The dark color will observe more heat.,2
118366,light colors reflect light,3
118352,A dark color such as black can absorb heat much faster while a light color doesn't absorb much heat faster but slower. ,3
118355,light colors keep heat out and dark keeps it in.,2
118338,"Usually dark colors attract the sun, and light colors usually reflect off the sun, so if you get, or have a light colored car, it will reflect off of the sun and will not attract the heat.",3
118348,I chose that one because bright lights reflect of so it won't be as hot.,2
118349,light colors don't radiate as much heat as dark cars do,2
118354,I would use bark inside and outside because the heat wont come in,2
118351,A dark color fabric would absorb the light and light color fabric would push the light off.,4
118361,0,1
118345,You should use these two because the light color will reflect the light while the dark color will absorb the light and heat.,5
118341,"Using light colored paints and fabrics reflect the heat off of them, instead of absorbing the heat like dark colors. ",4
118367,because it can be more cooler ,2
118343,"She should use a fabric because the paint of the car doesn't matter and if you use fabric, (for example) the steering wheel will not get hot. ",2
118357,because the bark coller would soke up the heat,2
118369,Using dark-colored fabric so it will give the car shade.,2
118339,Dark colors draw heat to them so lighter colors are better.,2
118372,I would choose to get a car with light colored fabric on the inside beacouse light reflects off of light colord things.,3
118360,if it is dark the dark brown and black will atract heat and make it hotter.,2
118356,Light colored things reflects light and heat when dark colors absorb light and heat,5
118347,Dark colors could trap heat inside and dark paint could make the same effect .,2
118371,"I  Choose a lighter coler paint because a darker color atraks the heat like black , but a light coloer like white does not get to hot.",2
118368,using adark colored fabric,2
118364,dark colored paint will exsorb more heat,3
118362,It absorbs less heat.,2
118397,I think that using a dark-colored paint on the outside keeps it cool and using a light-colored fabric on the inside keeps it cool because my mom has a car with that stuff and it is always cool in the car.,2
118393, I said for my answer using a light color fabric on the inside of the car because if you have a dark color fabric it will take in the heat of the sun even more than a light color fabric.,2
118417,because the dark colored car would take all the sun lights heat why`ll the inside with light colored fabric will not take that much heat,2
118403,if Laura uses a light colored paint on the outside it wont attract the sun as much as a dark color .,2
118410,the light color dosent take eney light in,2
118392,I choose a light color because a dark color absorbs most of the heat and a light color would take along time to get hot,3
118394,"The light colors don't absorb heat, dark colors like black make it hotter in the car because it absorbs heat",3
118413,I chose this because light colored fabric is the only valuable that reflects the light. All of the other choices either absorb the light or don't matter or don't do anything.   ,3
118408,in would be cooler was liter the sun would not atrct,2
118409,i would put it in side of my car  to make it less hotter,2
118401,Light colors don't absorb as much energy from the sun as you can with dark colors.,4
118405,it should be light colored because so the sun does not heat the car because when it's dark colored it it heats up . she should also have light colored fabric because it wont heat up as fast as dark colored fabric .,2
118402,Because the sun goes after dark objects,2
118406,Laura should paint her car in dark-colored so the outside will take all the heat and leave the inside some what cooler.,2
118400,I chose that she should use light colors on her car because dark colors attract the sun.,2
118415,"I chose these answers because light colors like white or sky blue, don't attract or absorb much sunlight.",3
118398,I think to use a dark paint because it will reflec from the sun,2
118395,I chose light color fabric and paint because dark colors attract the sun.,2
118412,since dark colored paint atracts more heat and light colored fabric would not help light colored paint dosent atract as much heat.,2
118391,The light colored fabric will deflect the sun's rays from getting inside while the dark colored fabric will absorb the sun's rays and let it in the car.,4
118411,If you used dark colored items they would absorb the heat.,3
118407,Dark things attract heat and light things don't attract that much heat.,2
118414,Dark colors collect heat,2
118418,"Light colors would make it a little cooler because when you where something dark, it absorbs more light.",4
118416,I think Laura should have a light color car because the sun is atractide to the sun. ,2
118396,you can have tented window ,2
118419,Using a dark colored fabric on the inside of the car because it can keep it cool or park your car in a shade part so your car want be as hot.,2
118404,if is a dark color the sun shine more in a dark color like black,2
118439,The dark fabric and paint absorbs the suns energy and the light colored fabric and paint usually reflects the light.,5
118437,dark colored paint keeps the sun from shinning on it.,2
118438,"We all know that dark colors attract sun heat, so the car has to be a light color. If Laura were to paint her car a light color it would not work because the material of the car will always attract the sun. If you put a light colored fabric over the car it will not make the car hot.",2
118443,"Dark colors in the sun will obsorbe the heat around it. Lightly colored  paint, fabric, etc. will keep the car more cooled than darkly colored paint, fabric, etc. will.",3
118456,I picked light colored paint and fabric because light colors reflect off the sun and dark colors attracts the heat.,3
118455,light colors absorb less heat because black or brown or any dark color absorbs heat and lets it go so it will get hot.,3
118446,Laura should have a light colored interior and exterior because darker colors like black attract heat and paler colors like white reflect heat.,4
118440,you should use light colors because when you use light colors the sun reflects  off of the car. if your car is dark the sun will atract it and it will heat your car up.,3
118451,The dark colored paint warm up faster.,2
118462,"when you are out in the sun,and you are in dark colors, you are more likely to get hotter.  when you were light colors in the sun you are more likely to get less hot than if you are wearing dark color.  so there for if you want to keep your car cooler in the summer get a light shaded car with a light shaded fabric",2
118442,using light colors will help because dark colors capture heat more.,2
118447,Dark colors conduct more heat from the sun.,2
118441,Dark colored paint will absorb the heat on the outside while on the inside the light colored fabric will deflect heat.,3
118452,I think that it is the right choice to put a lighter color paint on the outside because dark colors obsorb the sun.,3
118461,Heat is attracted to darker colors so if she uses light colors the car won't get as hot.,2
118460,Because then she can cover her car so the sun wont hit to much.,2
118464,you should have light colored car so then it is not hot .the inside of the car should be light to.,2
118453,"I would choose light colored paint on the outside to keep it cool in the day, also to support that a dark colored fabric to keep the cool air in.",2
118458,The white fabric will block the heat instead of the the black fabric obsorving the heat.,3
118454,Lighter colors reflect the sun away.,3
118457,light colored fabric is gonna block the heat from getting in the car ,2
118445,"I choose these because the black paint absorbs the heat on the outside and the light colored fabric wont absorb the heat in the car, not letting the heat leave the seat and out into the air.",3
118450,I think Laura should put light-colored paint on her car because if you put dark-colored paint on the car for example black paint the burning light heat from the sun would contrast with the dark paint and make the heat super strong. If you have light color the sun would not have to contrast as much and the heat wouldn't be as much.,2
118459,light color fabric is the anser by the light color bounce of not like the dark fabric because it collects the heat.,2
118463,because the light colored paint could reflect the suns heat,2
118448,"The darker the color the more heat it absorbs and the lighter the color the more heat it reflects so, a light colored fabric and paint would make the car cooler than a dark colored fabric and paint.",4
118444,"the light color of the car will deflect some of the suns rays, and any other heat that manages to get in will be reflected by the light-colored seats.",3
118476,I choose use a light colored fabric on the inside of the car because I heard that dark colors make it even more hot then it already is so that is how I know why I should not be wearing dark clothes on hot days and that is my answer for Lauras car.,2
118481,dark obsorbs heat,3
118535,As everyone knows darker colors attracts more light than lighter colors. so if she had a lighter paint and a lighter fabric the sun will not attract as much as a darker fabric and paint will and will also keep the car cool.,2
118540,I think you should use a light color on the outside and inside because black (or a really dark color) attracts heat.,2
118544,because darker colors absorb more heat the lighter the color the cooler it stays,3
118527,Well I think the light color on the inside will keep it cool because dark colors a tract the sun/heat so if it is dark colors on the inside it would get really hot.,2
118557,By using a light colored paint on the outside of the car it will not atract heat as easily as a dark colored car would.By using a light colored fabric on the inside of the car it will also keep the car cooler than a dark colored fabric car would.,2
118528,"light colors collect the least amount of heat
",2
118531,"I think you should use a light color because dark attracts the sun and light colors deflect the sun. Therefor, it will be cooler inside because there are more lighter colors than dark colors",2
118524,Using a light-colored paint on the outside and having light-colored fabric on the interior will keep the car cool while in the sun apposed to dark paint and dark fabric because dark colors attract the sun.,2
118545,it makes sense because the lighter the cooler. If you have dark cloth than it will be hotter,2
118558,It should be a light covered because a black colored fabric attracts the sun and a light covered fabric doesn't.Same with the paint.,2
118561,"For example if the car is painted white on the outside the heat will bounce off it,and if the fabric is white on the inside it won't absorb it.",2
118525,light color would keep the car cooler because darkness absorbs more sunlight,4
118539,"the dark absorbs light in the inside but the light color will reflect the light so not that much light will get in


",5
118554,the color will make it warm,2
118566,Dark colors make in cars or even cloths make things hotter or make people swet more.,2
118565,0,1
118550,"Using a dark color, like black, will absorb the heat to make Laura's car more hot! Using a light color, like gold, will repel the heat.",3
118551,I think that you should use light colors because the sun won't blend with the light colors.,2
118547,because the sun does not hit the car,2
118560,I choose the light colored because if it was dark the sun would reflect dark color,2
118568,prque esta enel sol,2
118553,"you want it be more dark because the sun doesn't like the dark stuff like windows that cover the passenger's seat so it's not hot.
",2
118546,I chose this because the color on the outside of the car doesn't matter but if you have a light colored fabric that covers your normally dark colored seats the car won't become as hot. ,2
118538,The light color fabric reflects the sun from getting hot.,3
118552,i don't know,1
118563,Dark colors absorb more heat than light colors.,3
118555,It will be using dark-colerd fabric on the inside of the car.,2
118569,I think that if you use light colored paint your car will not be as hot in the inside than dark colored cars.,2
118571,the dark colored paint will act like shade ,2
118559,i dont know,1
118564,A light-colored because black will get hot. ,2
118570,0,1
118585,"because it will reflect the light back into the sun
",2
118590,Light paint reflects sunlight,4
118575,lighter colors like white deflect energy but dark colors like black absorbs energy.,3
118594,because if you put the dark color it wont turn hot and inside the darkness will keep it cool,2
118586,dark color  absorbs sunlight and light color reflects sunlight,5
118595,it would help the car be cool when she come ln because the bright colors afects the sun to come in the car.,2
118578,the darker the color the more heat it attracts. So if she has a lighter interior and exterior she should have a cooler car.,2
118593,Since it is a light color and light fabric it will not heat up as much.,2
118582,so the sun can reflect of the light sun pannel,2
118587,i think your car should be a light colored paint because the sun makes the sun hot.,2
118588,Because dark colors obsorb heat better than light colors.,3
118589,Dark colors like black attract sunlight so light colored interior and paint on the outside will prevent that.,3
118579,The reason I chose light colors is because light colors absorb less heat making it cooler.,2
118603,"cause the less sun light there is the car won't be as hot.



",3
118592,I choose that choice beacuse ex:when people wear black the get hot. That is also why cars get hot too.,2
118584,Light colors on everything will keep the car cool because dark colors attract heat,2
118576,Light colors don't attract the sun but dark colors do. ,2
118599,It is better because if you have dark color like black it will be more hot inside and if you have light colors it wont heat that much.,2
118577,"because light fabric reflects light
",4
118591,I chose that one because it might reflect off the glass or metal,2
118580,I choose that answer because it might reflect off the car using the light coverd paint.,2
118598,The light colors reflect sunlight and heat while the dark colors absorb it.,5

118630,if she get the dark colored paint because it is good for the car and keep the car cool.,2
118583,so it does not etract the heat,2
118637,because if it was black it would keep the heat in and if it was light color it would not,2
119017,Light colors doesn't attracted heat.,2
118296,Dark colors obsord heat and light colors don't obsorb as much heat.  ,3
118300,Because you don't want the sun heating your car so put on light colored fabric.,2
118302,"A light colored paint and light colored fabric on the inside of the car would work because dark colors such as black, navy blue, and ect would be a bad choice for the car since dark colors absorb heat. But light colors don't absorb heat.",3
118310,I think the  car should be painted a light color and not a dark color so the sun is not a tracked to the cars dark paint and it wouldn't bleach the dark color off.,2
118304,Dark colors absorb heat and light colors deflect heat so it is wise to have a light-colored car to keep it cool.,3
118313,"Lighter fabric will absorb less radiation than darker fabric. So if I choose light fabric, the car will stay colder than dark fabric.",4
118319,lighter colors do not absorb the heat but darker colors do absorb heat.,3
118297,Using light colored outside and inside paint will make it cooler than having the dark paint absorbing sun light and the make the car hot.,4
118298,"The light colored paint on the outside will reflect the heat back out from the car, also with 
the light colored fabric inside. But if there was dark colored fabric and paint it will
absorb the heat in the car.",4

118305,it would get hotter if sh e used a dark colored paint outside,2
118293,You would want to use light colored paint and light colored fabric because dark colors absorbe heat and light colors don't.,3
118299,Well if you had a dark colored fabric on the inside it would nor reflect as much as the light colored fabric. And for the dark colored cars well that would help just a little but it would still reflect.,3
118309,the fabric can block the sun heat from the window.,2
118307,Because light colors absorb less heat. ,3
118306,"dark colors attract the lite but light colors do not attract sun light.
That is why i chose to use light colors.",3
118308,using a light colored paint will reflect more sun and a dark colored paint will absorb more sun and a light colored fabric will reflect and a dark colored fabric will absorb.,4
118321,"If you put dark paint on the outside it will attract a lot of solar radiation ,and if you put light colored paint it won't attract any solar radiation.Do not use any dark colored fabric because it will attract a lot solar radiation and if you  put light colored fabric it won't attract any solar radiation",3
118312,Using a light colored fabric on the inside of the car will keep the car cool because the dark colors (black) are the ones who attract heat than using a light color.,2

118301,I chose the colored the light stuff to keep the sun not exactly shining onto the car because dark colors attract the sun.,2
118316,sun is not attracted to light colars as much as dark colars.,2
118320,"If she were to paint the outside of the car nothing would happen.If she put dark colored fabric in the car,the sun would reflect off of the fabric and it would be hot.So that's why I chose light colored fabric.",2
118294,The lighter the color is the more reflective it is. So if the outside of the car is more reflective. The less heat gets trapped  inside.,3
118315,because when making a solar oven my partner and I used dark colors but if you want to cool down your car you should use light colors so it reflects light so that way laura can keep your car from getting to hot.,4
118323,she should use light colored paint because light colors reflect more sun light.,4
118482,i think she should put a dark colored fabric  on the inside so the light wont get in the inside of the car.,2
118478,Darker colored cars absorb the suns radiation.,4
118479,When the sun hits its the sun won't go inside the car.,2
118480,I think she should use a light color so that it does not attract the Sun.,2
118473,because people now that black attracts the suns heat and white reflects the suns heat.,2
118474,if you have a dark collard car the car will heat up ,2
118483,Using light-colored fabric is good because light-colored fabric reflects heat.,3

118475,Dark colors absorb heat more than light colors do.,3
118477,The reason why I chose using a light color on the outside of the car was because if you have a dark color on the outside dark colors attracts the sun to automatically hit you r car so its better to get a light color. Same goes with the inside color it should also be better to choose a light color as well.,2
118465,"Light colors have very high reflectivity, so they wouldn't absorb as much solar radiation. ",5
118487,a light colored paint would reflect the solar radiation,4
118488,Dark fabric obsorbs the sun and light fabric doesnt.,3
118486,I chose that because light colors don't really absorb the heat so it won't get really hot inside the car as dark colors do absorb the heat and it will get really hot inside the car.,3
118484,I did this because if it is hot light reflexs off of stuff!!!,4
118485,the bright white works like a reflection panal and the sunlight bounces of the white.,4
118490,i think almost everything that is made with the car should be light because if its dark it will observe the heat leaving it hot and the light ones wont be bad or make it really hot inside,3
118467,using light colored fabric will not absorb the heat such as the dark colored fabric that will absorb the heat.,3
118471,Light-colored things reflect heat and darker things absorb heat.,4

118466,light things reflect heat and dark things attract heat.,3
118543,I chose that because the light color will reflect the heat but the dark colored will observed the heat and it will cause to heat up ,4
118515,I think it should be a light colored fabric because according to other peoples solar ovens they used dark construction paper on the inside and it was way hotter on degrees than others so maybe the lighter the better.,2
118517,light dosnt attract heat but dark like black does attract heat.,2
118533,the light colored paint will reflect the heat/light.,4
118518,If you were to use dark colors on the car you will attract heat because of the colors and what they are made of the darker colors will attract heat more than the light colors do.,2
118548,Laura should use light colored fabric on the inside because it wont obsorb heat like if you put dark fabric.,3
118522,having a light color car will allow it not to obsorbe heat.same thing with the inside it will get hot. ,3
118562,i think using a light colored fabric to cover the car and a light colored paint becuse it will keep the car cool,2
118526,I picked these answers because the sun likes darker colors not lighter colors so if she dose lighter colors the it won't be as hot in the car.,2
118567,You should use light-colored paint and fabric for your car because light-colored things reflect heat much more than dark-colored things.,3
118516,You should use a light colored fabric on the seats because a color besides black will not attract heat to the car.,2

118519,Because dark colors attracks the sun and in the car it will be really hot inside the car.And  the light colors don't attrack the sun a lot.,2

118608, The most important Laura needs to do to keep her ca from the summer sun is to use light paint. light paint because it wont absorbed the heat and so the car doesn't get hot. she should also use light colored fabric inside the car so the car inside is not hot.,3
118597,she needs to keep light things inside so it dose not get really hot.,2
118630,0,1
118583,because when you sit down your legs will not get burnt. and light colors dont absorb that much heat.,3
118637,because if it was dark it will keep the heat inside but if it was light it wont keep the heat inside.,2
119017,Sun/heat is attracted to dark colors.,2
136389,"Darker things absorb heat and energy. This makes it warmer. If you use lighter colors, like white, then it will reflect the heat and energy. This makes the car, in this situation, cooler. The light car and fabric will reflect heat and energy making the car cool on a hot day",4
136362,Light color will reflect the light. So it does not come in to the car and I see people put those inside the car to keep it from getting hot.,4
136368,Well a light colored paint will reflect the heat from the sun.If you put a dark colored paint on the car it would absorb the heat making your car hotter.,2
136372,"If you use a dark colored paint it would absorb the heat and go through the roof, and if you had light colored fabric, it would reflect from the fabric and spread the heat around the car.",3
136352,"The lighter the color, the more light and heat gets reflected. Dark colors absorb more heat.",4
136382,"Light colors reflect more light than darker colors, making the object not absorb as much heat. So if she uses light fabrics and paints, more heat will be reflected making the car cooler.",4
136374,These heat sources will reflect most of the heat keeping her car cool.,2
136356,If you were to use paint to protect your car from the sun it wouldn't work because it doesn't really do anything besides reflecting the colors. I would pick a light colored fabric to put around my car because it can act like a shade or like your under a tree. Also I would pick a light colored one not a dark colored one because the dark one is the closest to black and black absorbs the heat which would make the car hot.,3
136370,Using the light color paint on the outside is her best choice because the colors refects off white but they all go to black.,3
136354,I chose toughs answers because the light colored stuff reflects the sun and the dark colors stuff obsorbes the light.,5
136367,i choose A and C because black absorbs heat and white dose not.,2
136388,"Light colors reflect most the color light. For example, a white car reflects all the light colors. The car stays cool because it reflect all the light that came from the sun. The sun is hot which makes me think the colors are hot when they aren't reflected or at anytime.",2
136683,be case the sun revlects off of light things but if she was to yous the dark thing it would ubzorm all of the light and that would case the car to get hoter ,4
136369,"the lighter the color the more uv it reflects, if she painted the inside or out of the car black it would absorb the heat making the car hotter.",4
136378,When you use a bright light color t shirt outside you will be hot and sweating but when you are wearing a dark color t shirt you will be hot warm and sweaty.,2
136359,"It will help her because if she has a light-colored car it will reflect heat but if she has a dark colored car it will absorb heat.
",4
136390,"I had chosen the third one ( to use light colored fabric, and light colored paint ) because when you use light colored fabric it cools down the car and makes it cooler inside so you will be cooler. When you use light colored paint on the outside of your car it wouldn't stay hot on the outside of the car.  ",2
136375,The color white or any light colord fabric dose not absorb any colors making it cool on the inside of the car. ,2
136384,Light colors reflect the sun's rays. Whereas dark colors absorb it.,5
136387,Light colors reflects light and results as something as being cooler or less hot.  If you have dark colors they will obsorb rayes from the sun resulting as the car being hot.,5
136366,Because using white or light colors wont attrack the suns heat as much and keep the car cool.,2
136363,Because if it's darker the fabric will absorb the light but if it's lighter it will deflect it.,5
136373,I chose something light because dark colors can cause warm and if you use a light color it wont cause a lot of heat so laura's car wont warm up as much as she wants it to.,2
136360,Because that reflects the sun light which has heat.,4
136364,The light colors will reflect more light because the closer the color is to white the more the color will reflect keeping the car cooler inside.,4
136380,The darker a color is the closer it is to black. Black absorbs the heat so her car will be hotter. If you have a white or lighter color your car may still be hot (according to the temperature) but it won't be as hot as a black car. have seats that are a light color help make it cooler because it won't absorb the heat.,3
136391,I think its black because light can reflect off all colors but black so if it does not reflect it would be going direct towards it and get kept there. ,4
136379, Using a light color fabric means it reflect light so it doesn't get hot.,4
136377,i choose a and c because when you are wearing a light colored shrit you don't get as hot as when you use a a dark colored shirt ,2
136381,"I chose using a light-colored paint on the outside, and a light-colored fabric on the inside because light colors reflect the light which makes it cooler, and dark colors absorb all the light, which makes it hotter.",5
136361,Black adsorbs and white reflects. So light cloth must reflect the heat.,4
136685,It will absorb the less light.,3
136419,"Since color is light and light comes from the sun, the more color something REFLECTS the the cooler it is so if she uses a light color paint and light color fabric the car will be cooler. ",3
136415,color bounces light easily.,2
136395,Light colors absorb less heat than dark colors. Therefore having ligher colors will help keep your car cooler.,4
136393,"If you have lighter colors, the less light will be absorbed, making it cooler inside the car. ",3
136408,Darker colors absorb heat. Lighter colors reflect heat.,4
136421,"Light colors reflect colors and the more colors it reflects, the more it stays cold.",2
136404,I belive painting the car a light color and having light colored fabric inside the car reduces heat because white (or a light color) reflects all light and solar energy- so Laura's car can stay cooler.,4
136420,The light colors will reflect most but the darker colors will absorb most.,4
136414,I chose those things because they are ways to prevent the from getting hot while it's in the sun. ,2
136392,"The lighter the color is, the less hotter it will get. Since dark colors absorb more heat you'll want to have light colors for your car.",3
136397,I think that useing a light color will help because dark color attract more heat.,2
136424,A light color reflects light better than a dark color. ,4
136423,"Light colored paint on the outside would make the car cooler because light colors deflect the sun's radiation. On the inside, there should be dark colored fabric becuase then it won't deflect heat onto the inside of the car.Instead it will soak in the heat.",5
136403,"When you use light colors it doesn't feel as hot, because dark colors collect more heat than light colors.",2
136412,"using a light color, will atract less heat than, if you were to have a dark colored car.",2
136407,Light colors absorb more heat than dark colors.,2
136411,BECAUSE INSIDE IS WERE IT GETS REALLY HOT AND BLACK LOCATES MORE HEAT THAN TAN.,2
136402,If it's dark it will get hotter. The darkness attracts heat so it will become hotter.  ,2
136400,Because light colored things don't heat up as much.,2
136406,If the car has light-colored paint on it there is chances that it will get less hot and if there is dark fabric on the car the shade will have it not hot.,2
136405,I chose this because light colored things don't absorb all the colors making it less hot. When you have a black car or seats it can make your car very hot from the heat because it's asborbing all colors. ,3
136416,dark attracts heat and light colors reflect heat,2
136409,White reflects all colors which makes white a colder color.,3
136398,"I picked these choices because, dark colors like black are known to absorb heat. Light colors like white are known to reflect light. This explains my choices.",5
136418,I think she should use this because it can keep her car colder and not so hot because its a light color and the sun bounces off light colors so if laura wants to keep her car cool that is what she needs ,3
136399,The lighter color will not absorb as much sun radiation then the black color  ,4
136417,I said that because when there is light colors there is less heat to be hot.,2
136425,"You pick light colors because it reflects the sun's light which creates heat. If she chose dark colors, it would be hotter because dark colors, black for instance, absorbs heat.",5
136394,I think using a light color paint would be better than a dark colored paint because the light color doesn't absorb that much light.,4
136422,I think she should us a light colored paint on the outside of her car because if her car is black heat absorbs into black and if its white heat reflects.,4
136410,bacouse dark colors absorb all of the light and heat while light colors reflect them when light is absorbed it makes the object absorbing it hotter.,5
136396,Because the dark colors like black attract more heat than light colors do ,2
136426,"Cause wight cools down sough, on the other hand, black makes sough hotter. ",2
136413,She wouldn't want the inside of her car to get hot so she would put light colored fabric inside and it would not absorb it.,2
136453,"I chose A and C because lighter colors reflect light. Meanwhile darker colors absorb light creating heat, heating up the car.",5
136451, If it is a light colered paint it will reflect the paint and if there is also a light colerad fabricant it will also reflect the solar heat,3
136462,White absorbs more color than black. Black does not reflect heat,2
136481,"Since dark colours like black, navy blue, and ect. make things hotter by attracting heat, people can change that by using light colours to reflect heat.",2
136460,"A darker color would have absorbed most of the heat. Yet, with a lighter colored paint the heat would be able to reflect off the paint. If it would have absorbed the heat the car would be much more hot than the light colored car.  ",4
136457,"Light colors reflect reflects sunlight, and they don't absorb much heat. Compared to dark colors, they absorb a lot of heat and sunlight. So using light colors would probably, but still. Your car is a hunk of metal, still going to heat up unless you find a tree to hind under.",5
136459,I think that it is a light colored paint because the sun is attracted to black and lighter colors it's not to fond of so if you have a light colored car you have better chances of the sun not hitting you or your car!!,2
136476,I chose using a light-colored paint on the outside of the car because light colors reflect other colors. I also chose Using light-colored fabric on the inside of the car because of the same reason.,3
136456,"If she uses light colored fabric on the outside of her car, the fabric will reflect the heat from the light, keeping the car cool.",3
136483,I chose these answers because light colors such as white reflects light and keeps the car cooler then it would if you use dark colored things on your car.,4
136463,Laura would want to have a light color on her car so it doesn't attract heat.,2
136450,The light color will reflect the heat on the inside and the outside.,3
136482,If you use dark colored paint or fabric for the inside and outside of your car it would suck up all of the sun light like how black does and if you use light colored paint or fabric for the inside and outside of your car then if would act like white and reflect the sun light.,4
136467,Using light colors means the colors reflect the sun. If you chose darker colors the colors will absorb the suns heat.,4
136454,if you use a light color fabric its will reflect all the heat that try's to come in the car. ,3
136465,You need something bright to reflect the heat. ,2
136477,I put  Using light-colored fabric on the inside of the car because light colors reflect.,3
136468,If the car has dark fabric and dark paint on the outside it might be cooler but if she gets light colored paint and fabric the car will get cooler.,2
136461,the light is being reflected by the light colored things in the car and around it sending the light into the air making it hotter not the car,3
136475,When you use lighter colors you feel cooler and when you use darker colors you do not feel that cool you feel hotter.,2
141559,well i think it should be dark inside and light inside because if light colors reflect heat most of it will deflect and if some heat does come in then the black can oxorb it and not deflect it all throu the car,4
136485,Because if it's light colored it might basically not get your car to hot and might reflect back to the sun because of the light color.,3
136452,"Light colors reflect light, while darker colors absorb light.",4
136471,because white reflects an black absorbs,4
136474,Light colors don't absorb as much heat/ colors as darker colors do.,4
141560,,1
136469,I choose this because the dark colered fabric will keep the sun from getting in your car but it will make it hotter.,2
141561,I picked this because if you use light fabric the inside of the car will be colder because light colors reflect the sun.,3
136480,"Because it's like if you wear dark closet you get hot, like black closet, so for it's the same for cars as well. The reason why is because, like dark colors has a low albedo and absorbs a lot of light, and light colors are the same but it doesn't absorb, it reflects.",4
136464,The reason is that because light color does not absorb as much heat as dark color. If she were to put a dark color in or outside of her car it would make the temperature increase. But however with a light color it will reflect the heat and make the cars temperature cooler/same instead of getting hot. That is my reasoning for this question.,4
136455,"White and softer colored cars would be Laura's best choices of staying cool because whiter shades reflect light, while black absorbs it, making summer days in the car almost unbearably hot inside.",5
136492,I think she should use a light colored paint outside the car because a lighter color reflects the sun's radiation and bounces off the car.,4
136500,I chose this because light colors reflect the sunlight while black and dark colors absorb the sun light.,5
136494,"I chose the light colored paint and fabric because light colors, like white, reflect the light.",3
136495,"It would be best for her to use all light colors because the light will reflect off of it. If she use dark colors, her car would absorb all heat and it would be extremely hot inside and on the outside of her car.",5
136499,"I say that Laura should use a light colored paint on the outside because if the color of the car on the outside is light, than the sun will reflect that the color such as white. On the inside if the color of the fabric on the inside is dark it will absorb all the heat on the in side of the car.",4
136489,"Well, if the inside and outside of her car was a darker color, the heat would all be absorbed into the seats, making it hot. If the inside and outside of the car was a lighter color, all the heat would reflect off of it instead.",4
136498,"Well, if you use light colored fabric or paint,the heat will reflect off the colors of heat. If you use dark colored fabric and paint, the the heat will store the energy from the sun which will make the car hot. ",5
136503,These two choices reflect light and doesn't absorbs it.,3
136509,Light colors don't asorb that much heat but dark colors asorb a lot of heat so that is why Laura could use Light colors to cool her cars down.,3
141563,If she puts light colored frabric inside then the light wont get the sun alot. if she puts it inside then it wont be hot it will be room temp.,2
136504,I think It will be a light color outside because I makes the suns radiation reflect and not make the car as hot as a black or darker color . If you change what is inside and the outside is dark the car will absorve the heat because its black . Even if the inside is cool  it doesn't mean the outside is to .,5
136490,White and lighter colors reflect the light and does not heat up. Black and darker colors absorb almost all of the light that is hitting the car.,5
136516,Light colors reflect heat. Dark colors absorb heat.,4
136507,"Light colors absorb less heat than dark ones, this would cause the heat from the sun to be less effective in heating the car overall.",2
136515,I think Laura should use light-colored paint and light-colored fabric for her car because white reflects and black absorbs. ,4
136501,"I think this because the light colors on the outside of her car, would reflect back some of the solar radiation, making it less hot. Also, that would be the same for having light colored fabric inside of the car.",4
136505,"I chose a and c, because, since white has a low albedo, the white reflects off the sun, and there will be not a lot of heat in the car, where as black has a high albedo, and would attract the sun, therefore making the car hotter.",2
,,0
136491,The light-colored things will reflect the light and give off less heat.,4
136511,because white reflects all colors and black  absorobs color.,4
136513,Because we've learned that darker colors absorb heat and lighter colors reflect heat.,4
136502,Because since a light colored paint will reflet the heat it will keep her car cool.,3
136508,I chose to use a light colored aint and fabric because light colors like white reflects light. The car will be cool all day long. If she used dark colored fabric and paint they will absorb the liight and will make the car too hot.,5
136493,Colors such as white and light colors light this reflects heat while colors such as black and dark colors absorb it.,4
,,1
136518,"I think Laura should use a light colored paint on the inside and outside of the car because light colors reflect heat and dark colors absorb heat. If Laura uses both light colors, her car will reflect all the heat. But, if she uses dark colors, her car will absorb all the heat. ",4
136512,Black or other darker colors attract more light than white or other light colors.,2
136506,"Well, if you pick anything black to use then it's going to suck in lots of heat because of all the colors going into it. So, in the end it will be hotter. But if you picked colored equipment then all colors but that certain color won't go in the object. So, colored objects are cooler than black objects.",2
136497,That is becuase I know for a fact that White keeps you cool and black keeps you hot. So you should choose the lighter color.,2
136514,I chose to use light colored paint on the outside because white reflects the sunlight that will make the car less hot since there is a light color on the outside so the car will not get super hot if there is a light colored paint on the outside of the car.,4
136519,I choose that because of albido if you have some color that is darker most lickly the car will be hotter.,2
136522,"She wants the car not to be hot, but it will be the most uncomfortable if the inside is hot. The outside being hot does not matter. ",2
136496,white keeps things cool.,2
136517,I think this because the heat will bounce off and not get absorbed.,2
136520,,1
136571,Becasue dark things and black things all absorb light while light colored things reflect light.,5
136550,The light color will make it cooler then a darker color.,2
136557,"Light reflects color, but also some heat. Black absorbs all colors and absorbs heat. Fabric traps heat and it becomes stuffy.",4
136566,the sun's heat can not be absorb by white stuff.,2
136558,Because dark colors make it hotter and light colors are less absorbent. ,2
136555,I feel like dark colors are better at reflecting heat then light colors.,2
136563,They will stay cool because of the low Albeto.,2
136556,I chose light colored cloth because of the Alfredo light color gives.  ,2
136569,"fabric is not as thin as paint, and a light color would keep the car cooler.",2
136574,I think this is the best option because light colors are more related to white which reflects the light and dark colors are related to black which absorbs light.,5
136565,,1
136561,Darker colors absorb more of the light spectrum and lighter reflects almost all of the light spectrum.,5
136583,I thought this because white can reflect light instead of absorbing it.,4
136551,well when you have a lighter or white car the light reflects off of the white and plus she should put those aluminum covers  ,4
136549,"The inside of the car would get hotter if it had lighter colored paint, and fabric instead of dark paint and light fabric because, if the outside was wight and the inside was wight the sun wouldn't absorb the light but instead reflects, and that would get stick in the car, but black paint would absorb the light, and your furniture stays cold.  ",3
136570,"Light colors reflect ultraviolet. If you have your car painted a light color like white then it will reflect ultraviolet waves, therefore keeping it cool. Having light colored fabric will also help keep it cool.",3
136560,Because the light paint and the light colored fabric will keep her car cool because it reflesct sunligt,4
136572,Light colers dont absorb the suns energy but black does  ,4
136559,I chose light paint and dark insides because if the car still does get hot it will be absorbed by the seats (and the windows hopefully wont explode).,2
136564,"I know this is the right choice because light colors have a high albedo.  Darker colors have a low albedo and absorb heat, which would make the car hotter.  The lighter color would reflect the heat.",4
136567,I picked this because the dark ones get hotter and the others stay cool .,2
136553,Because lighter colors don't adsorb as much as darker colors so and because lighter colors do the opposite of darker colors they reflect.  ,4
136546,Dark colored material has more albedo than a light colored material. Black or dark material would get hotter with the amount of albedo content in it. ,2
136580,"I think that the options that I chose are correct because if your car was dark color the dark color would absorb all of the heat, but if the car was a light color it would reflect the heat.",4
136576,i think this will help keep her car cool because if she were to have dark colors it would heat up faster because black absorbs all colors of heat but if she were to paint it white or some other light color it will reflect the sun or absorb tiny bits of thus causing her car to be cool.,4
136355,"I chose to use a light-colored paint on the outside and a  light-colored fabric on the inside of the car. If you chose a light-colored fabric, all the colors will reflect it so it will be less hot.",3
136351,I is useful to use bright colors on the inside and outside of the car because they will reflect off the color. But if it was dark the color would absorb the heat and it would go anywhere causing the car to get hotter.,4
136389,"Laura wants to make her car cooler on a hot day. If she wants to do this, the light colored paint and and fabric is what she should use. The light colored paint and fabric will have more white in it and the white reflects the sun. The heat and solar radiation will not go into the car but it will reflect it away. If she used the dark colored paint and fabric, it would absorb the solar radiation making the car warmer and that is not what she wants to do. ",5
136373,I said light colored fabric because if you use a dark color it would get hot and not cold.But if you use a light color it wont get a hot.And the car wont get heated.,2
136377,I choose this because black absorbs more color and white reflects making the white things cooler and black   hotter.,4
136366,"White has a higher albeodo than black because white reflects light while black exorbes it. 
So when you have black fabric in your car the seats will be super hot so thats why you should have whiite fabric and a white paint.",4
136356,I picked using light-colored fabric on the inside of the car. I picked this because It is light colored and light colors help reflect solar radiation. Also the fabric will act like an insulator. If some of the heat gets absorbed than the fabric will keep the heat from getting inside.,4
136363,Because the light-colored paint would deflect some of the heat and the light-colored fabric would help deflect some more.,3
136375,"The car will be cooler because, dark colord fabrics absorb the heat so if you use a light colord fabric it dose not absorb the heat therefor if will be cooler. ",3
136370,I think this because using white will reflect the light and you want to have it on the outside because metal is a conductor.,4
136391,I chose light color fabric because the darker the fabric like black the light can not reflect making it hot.,4
136404,"Anything light colored reflects solar energy, this is called having a high albedo. Albedo is how much an objects reflects. If Laura wanted a hot car, she would use black paint and black fabric because black absorbs solar energy rather than reflecting it. ",5
136411,if you use a light color everything inside and out you are hoping that the heat will reflect and not absorb the light and heat. ,4
136400,"The bright colors would reflect the sun's heat more, and the dark colors would absorb the heat so the car would be warmer.",2
136460,If it's really hot outside the sun is going to be beating down on Laura's car the white paint will reflect the heat to help not enter the car. The light colored seats will also help reflect the heat in case her windows are not reflective the seats can reflect hat back outside the car. ,3
136476,I chose using a light-colored paint on the outside of the car because light paint will reflect the sun as the dark paint will absorb the heat. I also chose use light-colored fabric on the inside of the car because of the same thing.,4
136462,I chose a light colored paint because the white absorbes abeto so it won`t get too hot. Then I chose the dark fabric inside because the black absorbes the sun rays so it won`t heat up. ,4
136504," I think that she should get both the fabric and the paint because white is going to reflect the light and not make the car as hot as all black ,. ",4
136500,I choose these options because of albedo. Dark colors absorb the sun which makes the car hotter. Lighter colors reflect the light making the car less hot.,5
136490,Light colors like white reflect the light. ,4
136505,"These are important, because using light fabric and a light paint, will make the car reflect sunlight, which is reflecting some of the heat that may have gone into the car to make it warmer. This is because white has a low albedo, and reflect light. But, if you were to use black materials, the car would get hotter, beucase it absorbs light and gets hotter.",5
136509,Because light-colored paint does not asorb heat that much than dark-colored paint.,3
136519,I picked this because of albedo and dark colors attract more sun.,2
136495,"There should be all light colors on her car because it will reflect the sunlight and heat. If she used dark colors, they would absorb all the heat and make the inside of the car extremely more hot.",5
136550,"As we said a while back, white items reflects light but black absorbs all of it, so if she uses white it shouldn't get too hot.",5
136572,White will reflect the sun so you wouldn't get that hot. The black will absorb the sun so she should chose a light color,4
136557,"Light reflects color, but also some heat. Black absorbs all colors and absorbs heat. Fabric traps heat and it becomes very hot.",4
136563,The light colors will reflect the heat so it won't get trapped in the sun.,3
136518,"I think Laura should use a light colored paint on the inside and outside of the car because light colors reflect heat and dark colors absorb heat. I also think that she should get both the light colored fabric and paint because light colors are going to reflect the light and not make the car as hot as dark colors would. If Laura uses both light colors, her car will reflect all the heat. But, if she uses dark colors, her car will absorb all the heat. ",4
136381,"A light-colored paint will help Laura keep her car cool because if she had a dark-colored paint, the paint will absorb all the heat, thus making it hot. The light-colored paint will just reflect off the heat, thus making it cooler.",4
136359,If you have a light colored paint on the outside your car will reflect heat instead of absorbing heat and if you have a light colored fabric inside your car the fabric won't get super hot.,3
136372,"She should use a dark colored car, and  a dark fabric on the inside because a dark colored car will keep the heat in,and will not bounce off another car which will bring more heat in, and if she used a light colored fabric on the inside, the heat would bounce of the seat, making the car hotter.",2
136382,"If she uses a lot of light colors on her car all the solar radiation will be reflected, not absorbed, making the car cooler. If she used dark colors a lot of heat would be absorbed making the car hotter.",5
136683,i chose all the lighter partes because if it was darker more heat would be adsorbed and mack the car hotter,3
136390,"I think that she should use the light colored paint one the outside and the light colored fabric on the inside because dark colors absorb colors,heat,and light and the  light colors reflect the, light ,and heat. ",4
136388,"Light colors make the inside of the car cooler because the sun color lights are being reflected not absorbed. It's like a sponge. A sponge soaks up a lot of water and gets bigger and they mostly have color. In a car the darker the color, the more heat that is in the car.",3
136362,The light color on the outside will reflect the heat. The darker the object the warmer it is. If the light is on the outside it will reflect outside so it will not reach inside the car.,3
136374,"Because this will reflect the majority of the light than absorb it, keeping it nice and cool.",3
136380,Darker colors absorb the light so it will make her car hotter. Lighter colors reflect the light making her car cooler so if she does not want her car to be hot then choose the lighter colors. ,5
136378,The white colored paint would reflect the heat but if the white colored paint was in the inside the hot air would go in the car reflects off and gets trapped by the window so then the hot air would heat the car. That is why i would put it on the outside.,3
136367,"I think that Laura should by a light painted car and a light colored fabric because if you have a dark colored car the suns light will absorb the heat causing the inside to be warmer, but if you use a light colored car the suns light will reflect the heat and the car wouldn't be so hot.",5
136352,Lighter colors reflect more light and heat while darker colors absorb more light an heat.,5
136360,so it reflects the suns heat.,2
136379, The lighter the it reflects light which makes heat go down.,3
6971,When its a hot day you would like to wear white because it keeps you cooler because the white is a more lighter color. If you wear black the sun will reflect and make you hotter. that is why i choose Using a light-colored paint on the outside. ,2
136368,The light colors will reflect the heat outside of the car to make it colder.When it reflects the heat will not stay inside the car.,3
136364,The light colored objects will reflect more light because light colored objects reflect light more. ,4
136384,If the outside paint is a light color the sun will reflect off of the car before the heat can even get into the car. This is why I think Laura should go with the light-colored paint on the outside.,3
136393,"If she uses a light colored paint on the outside, more light will be reflected away, unlike a dark color of paint, which will absorb the light, turning into heat. If she uses a dark fabric on the inside, the car will absorb the heat, making it hotter. If she uses a light colored fabric inside, the more heat will reflect out. ",4
136413,"The light colored fabric would reflect the heat out of the car, so the heat that got inside would leave, if it was on the outside it could not do that.",3
136394,I picked light colored paint because it would reflect more light and absorb less light then black.,4
136405,I chose this because the dark paint would take in the sun's heat and the car would get hot. With the lighter paint it will reflect more heat than absorb it. This same things goes for the fabric.  ,2
136423,light color on the outside would reflect the radition off the car. the dark color on the insade would make the heat stay in the fabric.,4
136398,"I chose these answers because using light or white materials will reflect light. If you used black or dark materials, they will heat up more quickly.",4
136414,I chose those things because white reflects the sun.,3
136408,Light colors reflect the light. Dark colors absorb the light.,5
136420,The light colors will reflect most of the heat back of the car but if you had dark colors than the heat would be absorbed into the car making it hot.,4
136419,"The white paint on the outside of the car will reflect the light and heat, and the dark fabric on the inside will absorb light and heat.",5
136424,If it is light it will reflect more light keeping it cool,4
136392,Since light colors reflect off light the paint that is white or another light-color will reflect most of the light out instead of absorbing like how dark colors do.,5
136426,"when you have a dark-colored paint on the outside of your car, it will absorb the most heat. and the  light-colored fabric on the inside of the car will not absorb a lot of the heat.
",4
136685,Using a light colored fabric and paint will not absorb a lot of light energy. ,3
136403,"If you use light colored things in or on your car like light-colored fabric on the inside of the car and light-colored paint on the outside, then your car will stay cool, because dark colored objects absorb the suns heat and become very hot. So you should use light-colored objects for your car in the summer in order for your car to stay cool.",2
136422,Using a light colored paint or fabric absorbs less heat than dark colored paint and fabric. ,3
136416,because heats bounces off light colors so the car absorbeds less heat to the car,4
136425,Laura should use light colors because it doesn't absorb heat it reflects it. If she were to use black it would absorb heat and it would be hot. ,4
136395," Since white has a high albedo, it will reflect most of the sunlight that hitsit. Therefore, the white colors on the car will help keep the car cool because there will be very little heat absorbed.",4
136474,The light-colored exterior and interior will reflect light away from the car.,4
136467,A light-colored paint would reflect the sunlight so it would keep the car cooler.,4
136463,"I chose light everything because, they don't attract heat, they reflect it.",3
136483,I chose the light colors because they will reflect the heat instead of absorbing it like the dark colors would do.,4
136461,The light would be reflected only making the outside of the car hotter and the inside just fine.,4
136465,She should light colors because it reflect the heat. ,3
136459,If your car isn't black it won't attract heat from the inside or outside of the car because the sun won't even want to look or point towards it if it isn't black or any dark color depending on the type of radiation that gets put down. ,2
136485,I choosed this for my answer because if you use dark fabric it will mostly contain and absorb the heat because when me an my teammates tested our solar oven our black paper was getting hotter when the foil reflected the light to our solar oven .,3
136455,"White (light colors) reflect light, so black and dark shades would be a dangerous choice if you want to not be hot in the summer sun.",4
136453,A light-colored paint would reflect the sunlight preventing it from creating heat.,4
136477,"I think it will be light-colored paint on the outside and light-colored fabric on the inside of the car
because it will make it reflect the heat outside and not inside.",3
136517,I think this because the light colored fabric pushes all the heat away and doesn't take any and absorb it.,3
136496,White keeps things cool.,2
136489,"Well, since the light colors reflect, the heat won't absorb. It will reflect the heat out to the outside.",3
136511,because black or close to black which is dark colors attract lots of heat and lighter colors closer to white reflect heat.,3
136499,"She should use us light colored paint on the outside and a dark colored fabric on the inside. The light colored paint wil reflect the sun's light and, the dark colored fabric will absorb the heat on the inside of the car.",4
136506,"Well, light colored things reflect color and light, while dark colored objects absorb light and color. So, that says that light colored objects will keep your car cooler.",4
136497,White will reflect the heat andthe black would absorb the heat.,4
136508,I chose using light colors because light colors will reflect the light and it will make the car cooler. The paint out on the outside would reflect the light and te carwould be cool.,4
141563,if you use a light colored fabric you dont atraced to it but if you have dark color it will atraccd the sun.,2
136501,"I think this because, light colors reflect heat, more than dark colors, so the light colored fabric and light colored paint will reflect the heat that would make the car warm/hot.",3
136493,"Dark colors absorb heat, so her car would get hotter. But light colors reflect heat so if she uses light colors her car will be cooler.",4
136512,If she wants to keep her car cool then she would want to use a lighter color since lighter colors reflect and darker colors absorb.,4
136503,The light colored objects reflect heat so less heat is obsorbed there for the car dosen't get to hot.,3
136498,"If you use light colors for the inside and outside of the car, it will make the car cool instead of using dark colors to make the car hot. ",2
136520,One scientific theory suggests that lighter tones of color absorb less light than dark tones of color.,3
136494,I said using a light-colored paint on the outside of the car because then the car will reflect the light from going inside the car.,4
136514,I chose to put light-colored paint on the outside and light-colored fabric on the inside of the car because using light colors such as white can reflect sunlight letting heat reflect off of the car making sure that the car does not get hot so using light colored fabric and light colored paint on the inside and outside will for sure make sure that the car is not hot due to the reflection of heat.,4
136522,I think using light-colored fabric in the inside of the car is most important to keep the car not too hot because then it won't absorb a lot of heat and Laura will probably want the inside of the car to kep cool and will not care very much about the outside being hot. ,3
136558,Because dark colored objects absorb heat.,3
136567,I chose this because the the dark stuff will absorbs all the heat.,3
136555,Light colors are good at reflecting heat but dark colors are good at getting heat but Laura want the car to be cool so she should use light colors.,3
136571,Light colered things reflect most light.,4
136551,the dark color absorbs the heat for there for it would be the best solution ,3
136566,I chose this because white colored stuff reflects heat. And a dark colored fabric on the inside because all the heat in the car will be absorb into the sun shade.,4
136549,"You want the car to be lighter because when light hits white it absorbs all color making it cooler, when you have dark items it makes the items hotter. We have this in are notes, when we write about the country and the city.",2
136355,"To keep the car cool, you don't want a dark color, because all it will do is absorb the heat. Also the lighter the color, the less it absorbs heat.",3
136492,I think this because the light colored paint will reflect the light back into the world.,4
136361,Light colored martial reflects heat and dark colored martial absorbs. So if she uses light colored martial it will reflect the heat out of the car.,4
136354,I chose thoughts because the solar radiation will not get absorbed and it will not get to hot.,4
136387,The light colored car and fabrics will reflect most of the rays from the sun resulting as the car being cooler.,4
136369,If she chose a dark color like black its going to absorb lot of heat causing the car to get very hot. If she used a light color like white it would reflect most of the heat causing the car not to get to hot.,4
136351,I chose to have light colors because they reflect heat and darker colors absorb it. ,4
136421,The light color (lets say white) will reflect the heat rays from the sun.,3
136397,"I think laura can keep her car cool by using a light color paint on the outside, because the light paint can b used as a conductor for the car.",2
136412,"The lighter color your car has the less color it obsorbs, and the less color the car obsorbs the less heat it has.",2
136399,the lighter color is not going to get as hot as the darker color.,2
136402,"We all know dark colors attract heat, if there are light colors it won't attract heat.",2
136396,I picked this answer because if its hot outside and the car paint is black the light colored seats stay cool and don't heat up.,2
136407,"The thingy called Albedo shows how the lighter colors have a lower temp, and the darker colors have a higher temp.",2
136406,Sence light colars dont atrack heat and solor radiation as much as dark colars if the car had light colars in the inside out it could be less hot.,2
136417,Light colors are better because it will reflect the brightness of it. ,3
136410,they will reflect the heat rather than absorb it.,3
136409,light colors reflect other colors which makes lighter  colors cooler when in the sun.,3
136450,We experienced that the darker colors make things hotter and the lighter colors make things cooler.,2
136451,Because  if you put a darker color paint on the car it will absorb the solar energy why as the light color on the outside will reflect the solar energy.,5
136468,With light paint on the car its better because it sometimes keeps the car nice and cool but it really doesn't matter because my family has a dark car and its always hot on a hot day. And on the light paint its the same as the dark paint its always HOT like the dark.,2
136480,"The reason why because of albedo. Albedo is for an example, if you have a dark color on it gets Extremely hot because darker colors absorbs more heat, than lighter colors.",3
136482,"Black it the most absorbent of all of the colors, therefore making dark colored paints, and fabric more absorbent making the car hot on a sunny day.",3
136457,"Light colored items have higher albedo. So it can reflect sunlight better than dark colored item which have low albedo. The lower the albedo, it's more likely to absorb the sunlight and gain heat.",5
136456,"Since lighter colors have a high albedo, the ability to reflect light, the car would reflect the heat with lighter color fabric and paint.",4
136454,Using a light color like white reflects the sun's heat from coming in to the car and becoming too hot.,2
141561,I picked this because if you have light colors on the outside you will have less heat trapped in the car because it will reflect the heat. If you us light paint it reflects the heat from the outside also making it cooler ,3
136475,I choose using a light colored paint on the outside and using light colored fabric on the inside of the car because the darker the color it is it will be hotter.,2
141559,well sins the albedo is high ( reflectivity ) the sun will reflect on the in side and the out side causeing it to be cooler than hotter.,3
136481,The white paint will reflect the sun rays away from the car.,4
136469,I think that using light colored fabric will help because it reflects heat and other colors. Using dark colored fabric would just aborbed the heat making it hotter.,4
136507,The lighter colors of the car contain less albedo than darker ones which causes the car to have a lower temperature. ,2
136502,I think so because according to albedo heat reflects off of light colored things and dark colors aborcs heat.,4
136515,I think she should use light-colored paint and fabric because lighter colors reflect heat unlike dark colors. ,3
136553,Because darker things adsorb and will get hotter. And lighter things don't adsorb they reflect so if it reflect the sun light then it won't get hot.  ,5
136583,"I chose these answers because the lighter the fabric, the more albedo it has.",2
136546,"Light colored materials have less albedo than darker colors, so it would be a material to use to keep the car somewhat cool",2
136574,I chose this one because when the colors are very light the rays will be reflected and it will not get hot inside and the outside too.,4
136570,The car should have a light-colored paint on the outside of the car because having a light- colored paint will reflect the solar and UV radiation. This is called albeto. If some solar and UV rays do get in to car then the light-colored fabric will reflect it back.,4
136569,I don't think paint would benefit the temperature very much. And darker colors would just make the car hotter.,2
136580,I think that Laura would need a light colored paint on the outside of her car because then the sun would have less heat radiating off of the car.,2
136564,"Using almost anything light colored helps because light colors have a high albedo so the light reflects and goes somewhere else besides the car.  Dark colors have low albedos and so the heat would be absorbed,  making the car hotter.",5
136559,"The darker the color the hotter it will get, that is why I chose light colors.",2
136561,White things reflect the most visible light and most waves on the electromagnetic spectrum. Black is the opposite and absorbs most of the spectrum.,5
136576,i say that you use a light color paint on the outside and a light color for the fabric because dark colors attract heat and get hot very fast but if you use light colors they are known to reflect sun mostly and don't get as hot as fast as dark colors do.,2
136556,I hose light colored paint on the outside because the albedo of the light color will reflect the light. ,4
136560,Because it can reflect the sun from the car.,3
139536,Light-colored objects tend to reflect more heat and not absorb heat.,3
139541,Light colored objects tend to reflect more heat rather than absorb.,3
139545,I think the light color would not attract as much heat as a dark color would and we would feel that inside of the car instead of the outside.,2
139542,A lighter color would reflect heat. ,3
139540,We learned that the color that is closer to black or a darker color would absorb more light than a light color.,4
139866,"Darker colors will absorb heat more, which means having a lighter color will absorb heat less.",3
139544,"In order to keep the car nice and cool while it sits in the sun, using a light color would be the best choice because light colors tend to absorb less heat and reflect all wavelengths of light. ",4
139864,Dark pigment absorbs more sunlight so you will feel more heat. ,4
139863,Using a dark color such as black will absorb more heat rather than using a lighter color which will reflect the heat. ,4
139495,Because light colored fabric does not absorb light and reflects it.,4
139494,"Using a dark-colored fabric on the inside of the car will keep the car cool because dark colors attract more heat, so the fabric will absorb all the heat from the sun when it hits the car.",2
139492,Light-colored materials do not absorb as much heat as the dark-colored materials. ,3
139824,I chose light-colored everything because darker colors absorb more light and heat than lighter colors.,4
139482,A light colored paint on the surface of your car will help reflect some of the radiation away from your car.,4
139493,"light colored things reflect light, which means the suns rays will be reflected, while dark colors things absorb light, which means it will absorbs the suns rays.",5
139483,"Laura should use a light colored paint and light colored fabric inside her car because those colors tend o absorb less radiation from the sun - making it harder for the car to heat up as quickly if her interior and exterior color scheme were dark, ",4
139834,"That way, the light is reflected off the car rather than absorbing it, like a dark colored car would.",4
139515,Using a light-colored paint on the outside of the car helps reflect most of the sun's radiation. This means that the car will absorb less of the radiation and be cooler.,5
139831,"The pigment matters because the ones on the lighter side of the spectrum does not absorb UV light as well as the dark ones, making it an effective choice to keeping the car cool. ",4
139525,Dark color fabrics will absorb most of the heat radiation from the Sun.,4
139514,The light color on the outside of the car helps reflect light energy. The light color fabric in the inside also does the same but it reflects the energy from the inside of the car.,4
139520,"Having a light-colored paint on the outside of the car will reduce the temperature of her car because light-colored paint reflects more light, reducing the temperature. Same thing with the light-colored fabric inside the car, the fabric will reflect light, reducing the heat.",4
139518,"Using light colored fabric on the inside of a car will help keep Laura cool because the light colors absorb less of the light from the sun.  If the interior were black, then all the energy from the sun's rays will be absorbed.",4
139527,Light colors reflect heat more than darker colors which absorb heat.,4
139506,"Since we are talking about the inside of the car we don't want to know about the outside material. Since using a light fabric is best because it reflects the most light, and it also doesn't let the air particles heat up",4
139832,"The light colored fabric will reflect the heat and not absorb as much. Because it does not store as much heat, the inside of the car will be cooler.",3
139833,"Light colors do not absorb as much heat as dark fabrics so if you use a light colored paint and a light color interior, the car will not trap as much heat inside as a dark colored combination. ",3
139505,"Using a light-colored paint on the outside would mean that more of the electromagnetic spectrum will be reflected from the sun, reducing heat energy from radiation. Using a light-colored fabric on the inside of the car will also have the same affect.",4
139508,"The sun's rays provide heat energy through radiation. Using the same principles as light, since these are electromagnetic waves, we know that the light will be able to penetrate through the car, especially on the windows because they are made of glass and are transparent, allowing the light to go through. Light colors reflect light, whereas dark colors absorb light, meaning that the light colors are reflecting heat energy from the electromagnetic waves and the dark colors are absorbing them, making the interior hotter through conduction. The light colors in the inside of the car will help keep the car cool because it provides another layer of protection in a way where the fabric can help reflect the light that is able to penetrate through the car's exterior.",5
139507,"Darker colors, especially black absorb heat heat while lighter colors like white, reflect heat. So in an effort to try and keep the car cool while it sits in the sun, Laura should aim to use a light colored car with a light fabric interior. ",4
139836,Using Dark colors will heat up your cars faster than the lighter colored paints or fabric because dark colors absorbs more heat rather than reflecting it. Using A lighter color would reflect most of the heat because it does not need to absorbs the colors of the sun as much as the darker colo ones.,4
139526,To keep her car cool Laura should use a light colored fabric because it won't absorb as much heat and reflect the light rays coming from the sun. ,4
139528,If you use a dark color more heat will be attracted to the car. This is because black does not reflect light meaning that it will absorb the heat. While white reflects all the color light that is coming from the sun.,2
139521,"light colored paint reflect most of the electromagnetic waves, which mean it absorb less radiation from the sun. This mean it absorb less heat.",5
139517,"Solar light reflects off of brighter colors more than darker colors so if the car is a brighter color, it would help reflect some of the light.",4
139861,It will reflect more light and it will not attract as much heat compared to a dark color.,2
140326,Usually darker colors attract more heat so if the car is lighter in color there will be a smaller chance of it being hot. ,2
139543,This is because since white absorbs the least amount of heat the outside color would still make a difference but the inside is what really matters because the air is trapped inside with no opening.,3
139865,The dark color paint would reflect some of the light out back towards the atmosphere. The light colored fabric would reflect some of the light off inside the car.,3
139538,Darker colors absorb light more so than light colors so having a light-colored paint on the outside will absorb less of the sunlight. ,4
139533,Lighter colors reflect heat while darker colors absorb the heat and make the inside of the car hotter. ,4
139539,The solar radiation bounces off and does not get absorbed because black does not have a heat wave than other colors. The brighter the light is the more heat energy there is.,3
139537,Light colors can reflect more light which means reflect more radiation that produces heat. The more light it reflects the less heat that will reach in the car and the car will be cooler than a car that has a darker color.,4
139862,The darker colored materials/paint absorbs heat better than lighter colors.,3
139535,"Darker colors tend to attract more heat from the Sun. If the outside is a darker color, the heat will be attracted to the outside. If the interior is light, it will absorb less heat, and allow the interior to be cooler. ",2
139534,"Using a light-colored paint and fabric would reduce the amount of heat energy being absorbed from the sun since light color reflects all the wavelengths of light, and therefore absorbs least heat.",5
139487,Using dark-colored fabric on the inside of the car will absorb the heat more that is being emitted. ,2
139826,Light-colored objects reflect white light therefore if Laura used light colored objects then the sun's rays would be reflected off the car and the car would not absorb heat.,4
139481,"When using a light-colored paint and fabric, it would mean that these colors would not absorb much of sun light rather than using a darker color such as black.",4
139485,"Dark colored fabrics allow for the heat to be trapped, for example if you were black colored clothing on a hot day, you will get hotter instead of cooling off. The light colored fabric in the inside of the car will allow the radiation to get trapped onto the fabric but it will not go any further than the fabric.",3
139497,Lighter colors reflect sun rays while darker colors absorb them. It would be wise for Laura to use a light colored fabric on the inside and get a car than has a lighter shade in order to reflect sunlight.,5
139479,Darker colors absorb larger amounts of energy from the sun.,4
139480,The pigments in a light colored paint will reflect more of the sun's radiation than the pigments in a dark colored paint. ,4
139496,"Using any light colored paint or items would help out a lot because light colors, like white, doesn't absorb much heat from the sun. This means that anything with light colors will be cooler. On the other hand, dark colors, like black, absorbs all the heat from the sun. This means that anything with dark colors will be hotter.",2
139488,Dark colored things absorb more heat than light colored things therefore dark colored fabric or paint would be more hot than light colored ones. ,3
139477,"The darker car paint and fabric, then the more light will be absorbed making the car hotter.",4
139486,"Since light colored materials reflect light rather than absorb it is the best solution to the problem, so instead of the car absorbing a lot of sun lights it will just absorb a little. ",5
139830,Black cars tend to attract more sunlight and rise in temperature on the inside and outside of the car. So switching to a lighter colored paint would make this not possible. ,2
139501,"Light colored things reflect and does not absorb much heat but dark colored things absorb more heat, so if you were to cool off a car, you would use something light and not dark in color. Basically you would use something that would not absorb the heat but reflect the heat. ",4
139829,Using light colors absorbs less light and the color outside the car does not matter because it still gets very hot inside the care at a very rapid pace. The color inside matters since the sun is hitting the things inside that is coming from the windows.,4
139489,Using a light-colored fabric on the inside of the car and a light-colored paint on the outside will cause the car to absorb less sunlight so the car will be less hot.,4
139490,"Darker colors are known to retain heat more than lighter colors, which could apply to cars as well. ",2
139491,by using a light- colored paint outside preventing the car form absorb too much heat from the sun and that could help the car cooler,2
139478,Darker colors(such as black) absorb the heat and sunlight more efficiently so it would cause Laura's car to become hotter. That is why using a lighter color paint for her care would be more efficinent because lighter colors reflect light and heat off better.,5
139827,the lighter the color the better because darker colors attract more sunlight,2
139498,"Since light colors doesn't absorb as much heat as dark colors, using a light colored fabric might be necessary to keep the car cool while it sits in the sun.",3
139499,When Laura picks her car she should think about the outside design of the car due to dark color having the ability to absorb heat and trap the heat. If the outside of the car is warm it will most likely leak into the inside of the car causing the car to be warm inside as well.,3
139823,"It is known that light-colored materials will not absorb as much heat as dark-colored materials. Therefore, it is optimal to use as much light-colored material in order to absorb as less heat as possible.",3
139509,I would think using dark-colored fabric on the inside of the car will help keep the car cool  while it sits in the sun because the dark-colored fabric will help prevent light entering the car.,2
139510,Light colored items tend to reflect light more than dark colored objects which absorbs heat.,5
139513,Using light color fabric on the insides will help prevent the solar radiation from the sun from being absorbed by the fabrics.,4
139523,I think light color fabric will help reflect some of the sun's radiation which will cool down the car or prevent it from getting hotter due to all the heat from the sun not being reflected.,4
139524,"Light colored fabrics reflect more light rays than darker colors, which absorbs the suns rays. ",5
139519,"Light colors reflect light, so much of the sunlight that hits the car's surface can be reflected off.",4
139522,"Since dark colors absorb heat, it would be best to use a light colored fabric. In addition, using fabric can help block the sunlight.",3
139516,Dark colors generally absorb more heat then light colors.,3
139511,"Choosing a light color paint will help reflect some of that ultraviolet radiation from the sun because if you have a dark colored car, the darker color will absorb a lot of the heat from the sun, increasing the temperature. Paint color is a important factor for the temperature on the inside and outside of your car. So chose a light colored paint for your car if you live in a warm place. Also depending on where you live will affect what paint type you want. ",2
139536,"Light colored paint and fabric reflect radiation more than dark colored paint and fabric. The less radiation is absorbed, the less heat will be inside of the car.",4
139541,"Less heat is absorbed when the color is light and more reflection occurs. If the light is light rather than dark, less heat will be absorbed and therefore it will keep the car cool.",4
139497,Lighter colors reflect light while darker colors absorb light. Using lighter colors will allow the car to remain the coolest.,5
139487,Light-colored fabrics do not absorb energy as much as dark-colored fabric. The fabric being in the car will keep it cool as heat will not be trapped inside the car.,4
139826,Light-colored paint reflects light waves being emitted from the sun so it will not absorb the sun's heat. Dark colors actually absorb heat therefore if the car were to be painted dark it would absorb the sun's heat and warm up.,5
139493,"By using light colors on the inside and the outside, it is able to reflect more light. Because it reflects more light, it causes the temperature of the car to be cooler.",4
139513,Using a light-colored fabric on the inside of the car will absorb less heat than that off a darker-colored.,3
139834,This means it reflects a lot of the light that hits it rather than absorb it.,4
139831,Using light colors are significant in reducing heat in the car as it sits in the sun as light colors are more easy to release heat as dark colors retain heat better. ,2
139516,The light colored objects absorbs less heat then the dark colored objects so the car would keep cooler if they use a lighter colored object.,3
139836,Using Dark colors will heat up your cars faster than the lighter colored paints or fabric because dark colors absorbs more heat rather than reflecting it. Using A lighter color would reflect most of the heat because it does not need to absorbs the colors of the sun as much as the darker colored ones.,4
139545,I think the light colored interior will help keep radiation from being absorbed because the dark colors attract radiation.,2
139538,"Since black colored objects absorb heat better, the lighter colored objects would help decrease the amount of heat being absorbed, allowing the car to become less hotter.",3
139533,"Lighter colors reflect more sun rays than dark colors do, so keeping everything light will allow the car to stay cooler since the heat is being reflected away. ",4
140326,The light colors will attract less heat so if she uses that the car wont be so hot. ,2
139543,This is because inside the car the heat can not escape and having non absorbent material will help a lot.,2
139534,"Using light color would keep the car cool because light colors don't absorb light energy very well, they reflect it.",5
139861,"The lighter color does not absorbs as much light/heat, compared to a dark color. ",4
139544,Using light colored paint and fabric outside the car/inside allows heat to be reflected rather than it being absorbed.,4
139864,So the insides dont absorb heat but instead reflects it so that i leaves the car. ,4
139542,Light colors reflect light and absorb less heat. A car with a light color all around would be cooler than a black colored car. ,5
139479,Lighter-colored material absorbs less light compared to darker-colored materials.,4
139477,The light color paint and fabric will not absorb as much light as a dark color fabric.,4
139501,,1
139485,,1
139515,"Using a light-colored fabric on the inside will reflect the incoming solar radiation back into the atmosphere. This reduces the amount of light energy absorbed inside the car, thus reducing the heat energy.",5
139514,More of the sun's energy would be reflected so less light energy would be absorbed.,5
139509,I chose these choices because the light-colored objects lessens the amount of heat being absorbed in he car.,3
139507,"If Laura wants to keep her car cool while it sits in the sun, then it is best to avoid getting a car that has dark colors both inside and out. Dark colors like black absorb a lot more heat than lighter colors so that means if the car is dark inside and out, it will get a lot warmer than a car than is lighter in color.",3
139510,Light colored items do not absorb heat as easily has darker colored objects. It reflects light.,5
139835,"I chose the lighter colors oppose to the darker colors because if she were to have all dark colors, there will be light reflected which will cause radiation. With the lighter colors, there won't be as much light reflected.",4
139517,"The light colored paint will reflect the light from the sun better leading to the light from the sun having a harder time to enter the car, making it cooler.",4
139521,"Light-colored paint reflect most of the light from the solar radiation, which less light is absorbed, and less heat is stored by the conversion of light energy to heat energy.",5
139526,By using light colored fabric on the inside of the car less sunlight will be absorbed and it will be reflected instead.,5
139511,"Light colored paint on the outside of the car is important because it doe not take in a lot of temperature from the sun, reflecting heat back.",3
139506,"The light colored fabric reflects the sunlight, and prevents light from entering.",4
139863,"by using light colors it would reflect and absorb less heat, rather than a darker color since a color such as black absorbs heat more than reflecting. ",4
139540,"Light-colored objects are less likely to absorb heat, while dark colored objects would absorb heat with a short period of time.",3
139866,"Darker colors will absorb heat, so if there is a lighter color fabric inside it will cool down faster.",3
139539,Using a dark-colored paint on the outside of the car will not reflect or absorb light and so less light will travel inside the car.,3
139823,Light-colored materials would not absorb as much heat as dark-colored materials.,3
139535,"Using light colored paint and fabric on the car will reflect radiation, preventing heat from being able to penetrate and collect in the car.",4
139862,Dark colors retain heat more well than lighter colors.,3
139537,Light colored paint on the outside tends to reflect more solar radiation because the light color of the paint tends to reflect more solar radiation than a dark colored painted car. This will cause less solar radiation to become Infrared Radiation.,5
139832,Light colored options because lighter colors reflect more light away and absorb less heat.,5
139523,Using a light colored fabric on the inside and outside of the the car would help the most because the light color paint would help reflect some the solar radiation outside and inside the car. IN addition the light color does not give out as much radiation as the darker colors which would help keeps her dogs cool.,4
139833,Light colors will absorb less radiation so it will be cooler even if it is sitting in the sun. ,4
139519,"Light colors reflect light, so the solar radiation reflects off the cars surface, preventing much of it from directly being absorbed into the car. ",5
139505,A light colored fabric/paint reflects more sunlight and the energy that comes along with it.,4
139483,The light colored fabric will reflect the solar radiation more and therefore allows less chance for the car to absorb the the radiation and warm up. ,5
139496,"Using any dark colored items, fabric, or paint will absorb all the heat from the sun and everything will warm up. As a result, the opposite would be best to keep things cool in the sun.  ",2
139489,Using light- colored fabric on the inside of the car will cause the inside of the car to have a higher reflectivity. I saw in one of the wise activity that having a higher reflectivity will lower the temperature because it cause more  radiation to be bounced off the surface.,4
139494,We would use light color on the outside because it would reflect it out instead of absorbing it and the dark color inside would trap the temperature.,4
139518,The light colored fabric on the inside of a car will keep the car cool while it sits in the sun because the light color fabric doesn't absorb heat light dark colored fabric would.,3
139525,The light colored fabric inside of the car will not absorb as much heat as the dark colored fabric on the inside of the car.,3
139520,Using a light-colored paint on the outside and light-colored fabric on the inside of the car will keep the car from getting too hot because light-colored material reflects heat energy from the sun while black colored materials absorb that heat.,5
139527,"Using light colored fabric on the inside of the car does not absorb heat like the dark colored fabric, same goes for the light colored paint compared to dark colored paint.",3
139508,"Dark colors tend to absorb heat and using light colors would help reflect some of the electromagnetic radiation penetrating through the car's windows. If more radiation is being reflected, then that means that more infrared radiation is being reflected too.",5
139524,Light colors will reflect heat whereas darker colors will reflect it. ,3
139528,,1
139522,Using light colored fabric keeps the air cool and reflects the heat molecules.,2
139824,Light-colored fabric reflects heat whereas dark color fabric would absorb heat making the car hot.,4
139482,A light colored paint job would reflect the sunlight meaning the car would not absorb the heat. ,5
139480,"A light colored paint will allow for less radiation to be absorbed by the sun, making the car feel cool even though it has been in the sun. ",4
139828,We would use light color on the outside because it would reflect it out instead of absorbing it and the dark color inside would trap the temperature inside. ,4
139492,"Light-colored objects reflect sunlight, so they do not absorb as much heat as dark-colored objects which absorbs sunlight. ",5
139829,Both will not absorb as much radiation and will make it cooler than it is outside. Dark colors absorb more heat and radiation which will not make the car cool.,4
139481,"When using a light-colored paint and fabric, it is not absorbing as much heat as a car with black paint and fabric.",3
139827,light colors do not attract as much color,2
139800,"Light colored paint will absorb less heat because it reflects light waves from the sun, unlike using dark colors that absorb heat and will cause the car to warm up.",5
139488,Dark colored fabric absorbs heat while light colored fabric reflects heat.,4
139495,The light colors will cause the light to be reflected whereas dark colors will absorb the light causing the light energy to turn into heat.,5
139785,"The colour black absorbs heat more effectively than the lighter colors, therefore if the paint and fabric are light, heat is able to escape more easily.",3
139769,The lighter colors will not absorb heat as much.,3

139803,,1
139643,"Darker colors absorb more heat so by using a lighter colored paint and fabric which absorbs less heat, this will help keep the car cooler. ",3
139802,The dark colors attract the heat from the sun so if you use a light color you can probably keep you car cool.,2
139842,Because when you have a Black car your car get warmer faster than having a white car ,2
139845,The heat from outside transfer slower into the car.,2
139846,The light-colored fabric will help keep Laura's car cool by conducting some of the heat away.,2
139561,dark colored stuff like black absorbs more heat so it's better to use light-colored stuff.,3
139798,"Since, dark attracts the sun, having both a light colored paint and fabric would be best for a car.",2
139870,"With a lighter color like white,the sun reflects its heat away more efficiently than with a darker color like black,which absorbs heat.",2
139838,It's important to use light colored paint and light colored fabric on your car because dark colors attract and absorb more heat than light colors do.,2
140093,"if you use a light colored paint then the paint will not have much sun light attracted to it as much, even though the sun will still hit the car it won't be as hot as an all black car",2
139840,Light because for dark colors absorbs the 3 primary colors that are present.,3
139875,The darker it is the more heat you're going to attract. Dark conducts more heat.,2
139806,I think the dark color paint would absorb more heat for the sunlight.,4
139856,Dark color attracts heat.,2
139841,A lighter color inside the car would mean the inside would be reflecting more sun than its absorbing.,3
139822,Light colors do not absorb light as much as dark colors do.,4
139737,Light color really does not absorbs the heat not like black it will always feel hot.,3
139853,A light colored fabric will help it cool because it won't absorb as much heat from the inside which will keep the car cool.,3
139775,Light colors reflect the sun unlike dark colors which absorb the sun.,4
139851,,1
139847,,1
139747,I think that using a light colored paint on the outside of the car will prevent the car getting hotter because the lighter the color will be the - the shinier it is to bounce sun rays back to the atmosphere.,4
139843,,1
139739,"These arre important because if the color is lighter, then it reflects the sun a lot better and doesn't absorb as much heat as the darker colors.",4
139848,,1
139849,if the fabric is dark then it contracts more heat but if the fabric is light then it doesn't contract that much heat as fast.,2
139879,Because light colored fabric will reflect the sun's rays not attract them.,2
139876,Because dark colors absorbs the 3 primary colors that are present.,3

139812,The lighter fabric reflects the sun from hitting the car so basically it blocks heat from being moved into the car,3
139782,Dark colors attract more of the heat then the light colors. ,2
140712,Light is more attracted to darker colored paint than light. The car will still get hot but it won't be as hot than if Laura painted the car with a darker color.,2
139529,because the darker color absorb more heat then the light color,3
139801,Dark colored objects will absorb and attract more heat. This will be the opposite for the light fabric. ,2
139774,I will use a dark colored fabric because if wont hit the sun to much and will maintain my car more cooler.,2

139787,A light colored paint cause it wouldnt absorb the heat from the sun like a dark colored car would. ,2
139799,Choose light colored everything so that the car will stay a little cooler rather than using dark colored things which will attract more heat inside of the car.,2
139785,Light colored paint and fabric will increase the amount of reflectivity which will then be able to reflect a larger amount of solar radiation and make the car more cooler than a car with dark colors.,4
139845,light color absorbs heat slower than dark color. ,3
140093,if you have a dark colored car than your car is more likely to be warmer when you leave your car out in the sun instead of a lighter colored car because the darker colored cars observe more sun energy. ,4
139808,I Know she should get a light color car because if she were to get a dark color car. The dark color will absorb more sun light and make the temp of the car increase.,4
139816,Light colors do not attract light energy (Heat) as well as dark colors do so the Light colored options are better for keeping the car cooler.,2
139819,Using a light colored paint makes it so it doesn't absorb as much heat from the sun in comparison to dark colors.,2
139782,Light color paint because darker colors attract more of the heat and light colors is less. ,2
139787,Light colored paint on the outside cause the color wont absorb that much heat than the darker colors.,3
139769,"Dark colors absorb heat more than light colors, using light colors will help reflect the light away from the car and the heat.",5
139809,If the colors are lighter than light will reflect and be less likely to be absorbed as heat,5
139556,Using a light-colored fabric on the inside of the car will keep the car cool because then it won't attracts as much heat.,2

139790,All these light colored material will help bounce back the solar radiation.,4
139797,Dark colored objects will absorb more heat than lighter colored objects because it absorbs all of the colors but lighter colored objects will not absorb as many colors.,3
139814,Using light-colored things won't heat up as much as dark-colored paint/fabric.,2
139810,,1
139795,Because using a dark-colored paint or dark-colored fabric can make the car hotter because dark colors absorb more energy or heat.,4
139796,Darker colors absorb more heat than lighter colors.,3
139798,"Using light colors on the outside and the inside would less likely attract the sun, since dark colors attract the sun.",2

139818,dark attracts heat. ,2
139643,Light color absorbs less heat thus the car will be cooler.,3
139850,"the light color would help it stay cool compated to dark colors because they attract heat, and certain fabric heats up easily",2
139802,The dark colors attracts more heat I don't know why but it does and if we use light colors it will keep the car cool. ,2
139843,I chose this because the sun reflects off light colors.,3
139849,the car fabric conducts heat from the light outside,4
139870,"The lighter the color of the car, both interior and exterior the more energy (heat) will be reflected keeping it cool. ",4
139881,because light colors bounce out the heat from the sun.,2
139876,"Because using a light-colored paint on the outside helps the car to reflect the sun's heat, therefore it won't be absorbed.a",3
139878,I think the best way is using light-colored fabric on the inside of the car because is doesn't easily attract heat from the sun. Also light-colored fabric is cooler than the dark-colored fabric.,2
139838,Dark colors tend to attract heat more than light colors do. The darker colors absorbs all wavelengths of light and reflects none while the light colors reflects all wavelengths of light and absorbs the least heat.,4
139880,I think that the best option is to use a a light colored paint on the outside because it makes the car cooler than warmer if you use a dark color it will be hotter because dark colors attract more heat.,2
139871,"Lighter colored fabric on the inside of the car helps it to contract. And if using dark colors, the heat absorbs.",4
139882,Using light colored fabric on the inside of the car will help keep the car cool because it doesn't absorb as much heat as dark colored fabric does.,3
139869,"If you use a lighter color than a darker color, then it may not attract heat as much.",2
139847,You should have light colored paint to reflect more light elsewhere rather then retain it in the car and you would have a larger area of high reflectivity than a light color fabric would on the inside.,4
139879,,1
139853,You put a light-color paint because it does not attract heat as much as dark colored ones. ,2
139747,Light fabric because weather forecaster advise people to wear a light shirts if its' too hot because it is very reflective and does not absorb heat.,4
139774,Using a light color will keep the car cool while it sits in the sun because darker colors make it hot and darker colors absorbs more heat while light colors helps us cool when its hot.,3
153977,Dark colors attract the sun more easily then bright colors do.,2
153978,"Scientists have proven that dark colors such as black, attract heat. Therefore, a light colored car and a light colored fabric are a better option if you don't want your car to get hot.",2
153979,Because light colors help the sun reflect of dark colors make the sun stay on for hours.,2
153980,Because the darker the color the hotter it gets.,2
153981,Dark colors attract the most sunlight. It only makes sense to use lighter colors.,3
153982,For example black is a dark color and dark colors collect more heat so I think you should light colored fabric on the inside of the car.,2
153983,i say light colored fabric because black attracts the heat and heat bounces off of light colors.,3
153984,what i chose is correct because wearing a black or dark shirt or cloths will suck in the heat from the suns solar rays,3
153987,bc if you us light in the inside and outside it will get to warm,2
153989,I think this because darker paints can get hot sooner then light color paints.,2
153991,Dark colors like black suck in heat and a lot of it; light colors would not suck as much heat keeping the seats cooler.,2
153992,Cause we tried that.,2
153993,I think it should be light colord seats because the paint dosent really matter to me and when i was little my mom's car had black colord seats and the car got really hot a LOT.,2
153994,"The darker the coler, the hotter it gets. I learned this from clothes.",2
153996,I think it is using dark-colored fabric because it looks like it will be sunny.,2
153997,you should put something that is light on the inside of the car because if its black then the sun will go towards it,2
153999,I think this becuse the dark will keep it cooler.,2
154000,darker colors a traked more sun or heat up faster,2
154026,You want to use lighter colors because dark colors attract the heat. If you have lighter colors then the heat bounces off the light colors.,3
154107,Doing a light colored paint on the outside and inside  because dark colors attracts heat while light color reflects heat.,3
154108,"I chose using light colored fabric and using a light colored paint because when the sun rays hit the light color, it won't absorb as much as it would to a dark colored one. For example, if its a hot day and you're wearing a light colored shirt such as white, it wont be as hot, but if you wear a dark colored shirt such as black, it will be very hot. So when the sun rays go through the car windows, it won't absorb the fabric as long as it is a light color.",4
154109,I choice light color for the inside fabric and the outside paint because if you use light color it will reflect the sun but if you use dark colors it will absorb the sun.,4
154111,I choose the light inside and outside because dark attracts heat not light colors,2
154113,Because with dark colors like black it gets hotter because of a theory,2
,,1
154114,I think this because dark colors heat up faster but light colors don't as fast.,2
154115,I think this because dark colors attract heat.,2
154117,I chose a light colored car because it depends on the seat type like leather.On the outside if it a black car it would attract the sun and get beamed on but say the car was white or pink then the sun would get less attracted then on a black car would.,2
154121,even if your car is out side your car still gets very hot.,2
154123,because dark color atrack heat so it will get much warmer.,2
154126,I choose my answer because the dark fabric will shade out the sunlight,3
154129,Using light colored paint wont attract as much as black.,2
154131,Since dark colors attract heat light colored fabrics don't. So if she wanted to keep her car cool she should use light colored fabrics.,2
154133,why its better for her to use light color paint on the out side and Using dark paint fabric helps the car not heat up.,2
154136,A dark color fabric will make a car hot,2
154137,"If Laura wants to keep her car cool, then she would want to have a plan like parking it under a tree or somewhere shady. For example if Laura had a black colored car it would be attracted to the sun. I think if she has a light colored car and light colored fabric her car wouldn't get hot.",2
154138,Because if it is dark it heats up  faster then when it is lighter so that why she needs to have the paint lighter than darker its like if she wore black or any dark color it heats up faster than when she were any light color so the same thing happens to the car .,2
154139,I chose this because  if it blocks the window the sun wont be able to get in and it would not be hot.,2
154142,I chose to do a light colors because it doesn't heat up fast.,2
154149,some times on hot days you can have things in front and in the windows to ceep the heat from the car getting heated up.,2
154154,light colored paint is better because you don't get to suffer in the hot sun because if you use dark colored paint it will be hot inside the car and you won't be able to handle the hot sun your gonna feel like getting out of the car.,2
154302,i think laura should use a light color of paint on the outside because light colors keep things cooler than dark colors because dark colors make things hot,2
154304,i chose this because i know that black traps heat so bright colors wont,2
154306,"I know that lighter colors don't attract much heat as the darker ones, so light paint and fabric will reduce the heat in the car.",2
154308,I know that darker a color the more light it will absorb and heat so if you have the light color car youre not going to absorb that much heat.,4
154312,the color black atracs the sun.,2
154313,I think this because dark colors attract heat.,2
154314,Light colored paint and fabric would be better to use because if Laura doesn't want her car to get hot then using a light colored interior and paint would be good.,2
154315,Light colored things don't get as hot and dark colors like black get very hot.,2
154316,I would make the car a light color because it doesn't hold in heat as well as a dark color.,2
154317,Light colors take longer to heat up then darker colors.,2
154320,"sun is attracted to dark colors, which heat up really fast and almost cling to it, light colors on the other hand doesn't repell sun but sun is a lot less attracted to it",2
154328,light colored paint would work because heat only attracts dark colors like black. Black attracts heat.,2
154331,I think that she should keep the light color outside because if it was the dark color it would get really hot and if it was light color it would not get that hot in the car so that is the solution.,2
154333,Dark colors absorbs heat and light colors make heat bounce off.,4
154334,dark colers ovsorb ,3
153978,Scientists have shown that dark colors like black will attract heat. Therefor a light colored car is the best option.,2
153979,A light color will make the sun reflect of the car so it will be a little warm but it will still work,3
153982,"Black collects heat, so it is good to have a light-colored fabric in the inside of the car.",2
154914,"She should use light colored materials because it reflects the light, when dark colors absorb it and make it hotter.",5
153991,Light colored objects don't absorb as much heat.,3
154107,Using light colored paint because light colors reflect heat and dark colors attract heat,3
154117,I pick   dark paint on the  outside,2
154126,I choose the light colored paint because the dark colored paint attracted light but the light colored paint repels light.,3
154111,I think this because the heat will reflect right off the car.,3
154108,Using light colors for both the inside and outside of the car is important because the light colors reflect the sunlight off.,4
154133,I picked them because its better if you have a dark color in the outside and a light color in the inside so it would not heat up.,2
154113,Because dark colored things heat up faster then lightly colored objects.,2
154120,Using light colored paint/fabric would let the car cooler since fabric does not take take as much heat as other materials. The reason i chose the light colored fabric is because i believe that the color would affect the temperature inside the car.,2
154137,If the color inside and the color outside is dark from both it will get hot and be attracted to the sun.,2
154114,I chose this because light colors don't heat up as much as dark colors do.,2
154121,the sun will reflect,3
154131,Using light colored paint makes it cooler because dark colored makes it warmer.,2
154125,the sun is a tractid to it.,2
154123,because light color dont drag heat.,2
154313,Because light colors repel heat.,2
154315,I would want theose to be both light because dark colors attrack heat.,2
154304,I chose this because dark colors trap heat so you don't want them in your car.,2
154704,"Dark fabric absorbs heat, so the car would be hotter will dark fabric than with light, not absorbent fabric.",3
154303,"I think using a light-colored paint on the outside will help it to make it cool because light colors don't attract the heat. But with a dark color, for example, the color black. Since black is a dark color, it absorbs more heat.",3
154309,"I think the light colors will attract less heat because darker colors will attract more heat therefore, making the car heat up faster, especially in the summer.",2
154316,I chose these because the lighter the color the less the heat is absorbed.,3
154312,dark colors atract more haet,2
154302,Usually light colors attract less heat than darker colors so it would be a smart idea to use light colors on the outside and inside  to keep the car cooler.,2
154314,"If the paint and fabric of the car were black, it would not be able to reflect paint away. So Light colored paint and fabric is good.",3
154317,Light colors take longer to heat up.,2
154320,"dark colored anything absorbs heat, while light colors don't exactly reflect light, but don't really absorb it like the dark colors.",5
154344,I chose this answer because light colored things don't attract less heat than dark colored things.,2
153997,use a light color fabric because if you use paint it just not as good and if you use black it will attracted height.,2
153989,I think this because black brings in more heat than white.,2
154000,it would be smart because barker colors atract heat and absorb,3
153981,"Since black attracts heat, it would only be wise to have a light colored car.",2
153980,I chose light inside and light outside because it attracts less heat then darker colors.,2
153996,Use dark colored fabric because dark colors keep the sun away.,2
154026,I think she wants light colors because the dark colors attract heat.,2
153985,The light fabric will not attract heat so it will be the coldest.,2
153999,the light colored stuff does not obsorb as much heat.,3
154138,Because dark colors heat up faster than light colors.,2
154115,Use light colored fabrics and paint because dark colored fabric and paint attracts heat.,2
154142,Light colors are better because dark colored fabric have heat.,2
154109,I said using like color on the inside and outside because light color reflect.,3
154306,White and light colors will reflect most of the sunlight from going in the car.,4
154340,I chose that one because its like tin foil so it just reflect of.,3
154846,Laura should use light colored fabric for the inside and the outside of the car because light colors don't absorb heat as much as dark colors do.,3
154129,Lighter colors tend to not attract a lot of heat than darker.,2
154156,"Because if the dark-colored was outside the sun won,t hit to much the sun heat.",2
154915,Dark colorers make heat go to them.,2
153993,I know that because my moms old car had dark fabric and when the car was outside it got really hot so Laura should use light colored fabric.,2
153992,cause it's light so it's not going to be as hot,2
153816,Using a light-colored fabric or paint would be coolest because darker colors absorb solar radiation.,4
153818,Light colored things are more reflective and will heat up less.,3
153822,i think lighter things work better because dark fabrics and dark objects tend to pick up more heat andd get hotter.,2
153823,Light colored fabric because the lighter the color the less energy it will absorb.,4
153824,"Well, if you use more light colored fabric and paint, less heat is taken into the car, because darker paint and fabric sucks"" up more heat  causing the inside to boil.""",2
153826,light colors attract less heat.,2
153827,she should use a like colored paint and a light colored fabric because dark colors attract the sun.,2
153830,"Dark colored things absorb heat, so if you use a light colored thing it won't absorb heat. You would use the fabric inside because it will keep the inside nice and cool because the energy won't really go through the outside of the car.",4
153831,Light colors because if you wear black and a friend is wearing white you will get hotter than him because the darker colors attract more heat.,2
153832,The light fabric makes the seat reflect the sun and not absorb it.,4
153834,Dark colored thing attrct sun more causing them to heat up quicker.,2
153835,i think she should use a light color fabric because heat is atracted to dark colors not light colors.,2
153836,"Dark colors atract heat, that is why people don't usually when black when it is hot outside.",2
153837,"I think a light-colored paint is good because having a light-colored paint, it won't attract the sun like darker colors.",2
153838,i chose put frabic in your car because it will prectect it from the sn an light color aint dosent effect wth eachother,2
153843,dark atracts more sun light because dark atracts more sun light,3
153844,Well i chose that because like if your wearing black ten you get more hot so then if might be the same with darker colors so that is why i chose light colored fabric.,2
153845,I think you should use dark colored material inside the car that way it wouldn't attract that much light.,3
153848,ttract,2
153852,I chose black because it wont reflect and there is going to be no bright light inside the car. And white will reflect and will make the sun come towards the car even more.,3
153854,Dark colors refleck light and can heat up the car more.,3
153856,Because it will cool the seats in my opinion on laura's car .,2
153859,because lighter cooles the item done and the darker obgecks heat things up,2
153863,It wont attract the sun much,2
153864,you should use the light colerd choices because they don't absorb heat where if you have a dark colerd car it will absorb heat.,3
153905,"Dark colors bring heat. If it is a light color, than it will be cooler.",2
153906,Light colors because dark colors take heat in and make every thing hot inside.,2
153908,Because black and dark colors are attracted by the sun.,2
153909,"light colors bounce the sun rays back towards the sun, dark colors on the other hand  attract the rays to the car.",4
153910,If the car paint is like almost black the sun the will attract to it same with the fabric.,2
153911,i chose those too for once again i haven been in this situation and the cars that have darker colored seats and paint attract more heat and im npt saying lighter is better but it would less hot,2
153913,cause if its dark it might make it hotter than want  an outside and you don't want that.,2
153914,Darker colors attract the sun. A car that is painted black and has black fabric on the inside is most likely to get warmer inside than a car painted white with white fabric on the inside.,2
153915,the seats wont be warm,2
153916,Lighter colors reflect the sunlight and will keep the car cooler.,4
153917,i think this because the light color don't prevent heat and dark colors do. And i also think the light colored fabric will work also because it won't burn your behind.,2
153918,if you were black you will feel hotter,2
153919,I chose these becase the sun as a harder time going through darker things.,2
153921,Using light fabric because the sun is attracted to dark colors and if you use a light color it won't get to hot.,2
153922,white things reflect the sun back up,3
153923,I think she should put a light colored fabric because if you put a dark color like black it will heat up because the sun radiation will go through and with light colors like white it will not.,3
153924,it is like having a black shirt and it make you more hotter,2
153925,it keeps your gas from leaking,2
153926,Dark colors attract the sun so painting the car black or having a dark fabric will make the car hot. And she doesn't have to paint he car a light color if she doesn't want to she can just get a light color fabric and put it on the car.,2
153927,because if it is in the inside it wont be hot,2
153928,I choose light colored fabric and paint because back and dark colors can attract heat.,2
153929,Dark colors attract sun light witch will heat up the car.,3
153930,I chose that because see people put the light colored fabrics on the car front on sunny days.,2
153931,well dark colors get hotter faster because it attrctices the sun,2
153932,I choice the light colored paint and the light colored fabric because dark color's can cos sun.,2
153933,I think this is the right awnser because people usually put those sun reflecting tin foil colored things on their car window.,2
153935,I chose light colors because dark colors like black attract heat making a car much hotter.,2
153936,using light color,2
154112,I think she should use a light colored fabric because if she uses a dark colored fabric it is going to get more heat.,2
154118,i know thaat the sun hits dark colors more.so i chose to say pant it a light color,2
154119,Light colored options don't observe a lot of heat. I know that because I have tested it and the dark-colored car is the hottest.,3
154122,caue the heat from the sun is being blocked,2
154124,Is you are wearing dark colored clothes outside in the summer you will get hotter. The paint ats as the cars clothes.,2
154127,"I chose this because light colors don't attract the sun as much as dark colors, and if Laura puts paint on the outside it will keep the sun out of the car.",2
154128,The sun rays are attracted to dark colors so by using a light color on the outside it won't  let the heat come i.,3
154130,because he heat would go in.,2
154132,black contracts heat faster so if its white it will not get as hot.,2
154134,I said those were my chooses because sun rays are attracted to darker colored objects rather than lighter colored objects.,3
154135,I think i would do this because dark black is really hard to get hot and burn through so it will keep the car cool,2
154141,Using light color won't contrast the sun to a dark color.,2
154143,I think this because of te light color is not heavy niether the sun can make it hot in the hot,2
154145,These should be used so the metal of the car passes to the  fabric then makes the car hot during the summer.,2
154146,"I think it would be what I chose because if you where black you will get hotter, well that's what everyone says even my mom. So if I was in the picture I would chose a lighter color instead than a different color",2
154147,I chose a lighter paint color because darkness atracks heat.,2
154148,Because since its less thick it is cooler,2
154150,it prevents it by getting hot because if it is a light color it would get hot,2
154152,i chose dark cooler because the light one because the light is like the sun.,2
154153,because the eat wont affect.,2
154157,"If you use dark color it will make it hotter inside and if you use light colored, it will make it so that the heat doesn't go inside",2
154160,I think using the light colored fabric should go inside of the car because something dark in the sun,2
154162,using light colored fabric would help because then the sun wouldn't get through,2
154193,"If the inside is white it wont keep the sun  in the fabric it has, but if its black it will totaly obsorbe the heat like a sponge.",3
154194,I chose this answer because the dark color paint will only make the metal hot on the outside. When you have light color fabric on the inside the energy will come in through the glass but the fabric will not absorb as much energy as the dark fabric or paint and the energy would just bounce out of the car,5
154195,I hhink my choice is correct because dark colors attract sunlight.,3
154196,I said this because dark colored fabric like black,2
154197,The color black absorbs more heat.,3
154198,the white paint will let the sun shine off the paint he black wont,2
154199,I chose light colored fabric inside the car because then the inside of her car would not get hot because darker colors attract the sun.,2
154200,it has to be cool because for example a black jacket gets more hot than a light blue jacket so cool colors get less heat.,2
154201,The sun is not attracted to the light color.,2
154202,She should do this because light colored paint will reflect light the other direction.,4
154204,the dark is better because it keeps the un out,2
154205,From experience I have had a black jacket on and it is hotter then the neon jacket.,2
154206,Because the black colored paint or/and fabric will attract heat.,2
154207,Because if you put it inside the fabric is going to get hot not the inside of the car,2
154208,Dark Colors would not let in as much solar radiation as lighter colors would because it would be harder for solar energy to pass through dark colors.,3
154210,I choose a light-colored paint on the outside because then the car wouldn't absorb more heat.,3
154211,Dark things heat up faster and absorb it. Light things do that but at a much slower pace and don't get as got.,3
154212,i think this because i know when a dark colored car meets sun it gets the car really hot in the inside.,2
154214,Keeping the whole car light and shiny reflects the sun's rays away from the car.,4
154215,because so the sun cant go through the sun.,2
154216,Black makes it cool.,2
154218,well sense black attracts the sun i wouldn't choose black because it would make my car hot and tan or something wouldn't.,2
154220,i dont know,1
154221,if you chose the darker color the sun would attract more heat.,2
154223,because  darker coloers atrak the sun,2
154224,This is my answer because it is te best an,2
154226,If she uses a light color it is going to melt .,2
154228,because if its black it will get hotter.,2
154307,I think it's best to use light colored paint on the inside and outside because when ever you use black colored paint then it always make the car hotter.,2
154318,it is,1
154319,"I believe this because somehow like my father told me when your wearing a darker color like black you get hotter but, when your wearing a lighter color you don't get as hot.",2
154321,I think light colors will keep it cool because when you wear white clothing you arent as hot but with dark clothing you get really hot.,2
154322,i know that the lighter color of the car the cooler it is.,2
154323,becuse black atracts heat,2
154324,The white will reflect the heat and black will attract heat.,3
154325,Dark colored paint will deflect light so it shines away from the car.,3
154326,dark colors attract heat.,2
154327,"if the hot air hits the outside of the car, it is ok. if you use a lighter shade on the inside, the sun wont attract to it.",2
154329,light colored because the fabric tends to heat up more when the color gets darker.,2
154330,"light fabric on the car, because the sun will reflect off of it. Also keeping the light fabric inside the car, is better so it does not go in the c",3
154335,Dark colers are fast to heat up because they atraked the sun.,2
154336,dark becues the sun wont hit,2
154337,Maybe with the dark color it might not attract the sun as much as the light color.,2
154342,I chose those because my parents have a black car and a white car my moms car is always less hot when left in the sun.When my Dads car is like double the heat it is ouside,2
154343,when you have lightr coulers it wont be as hot for example if you wear black you will feel hoter but if you wear a wight jacket you will be colder,2
154345,Dark colors make more heat than light colors so its better to use light colors,2
154353,if you use light colors the car will be cooler,2
154371,Just couse,1
154155,it helps to block the heat,2
154151,ther is a lot of cars,2
153824,"I chose this because if the car color was dark like black or dark red, it would naturally take in more solar radiation. If it is light colored, less solar radiation would be absorbed, making the atmosphere colder.",4
153822,Light objects don't absorb ass much heat as dark colored object so if she has a light car and light cushions then her car is less likely to heat up.,3
153844,I think it would have to be a light color because dark colors attrack and absorb heat so maybe a light color would do the oppisite.,3
153852,We chose the first answer because bright light reflects and it keeps the car from heating up.,3
153838,You should use a light color because the sun reacted to dark colors an if you use a light color it  would not reacted to the light color.,2
155053,Her car has to be light because dark colors attract sunlight and she wants to keep her car cool.,3
153831,The darker the color the more heat it will absorb. If it is lighter it will not get as hot.,3
153816,Dark colors conduct heat,2
153823,Light colored fabric because the lighter the color the less energy it will absorb meaning it won't get as hot.,4
153837,I would want lighter colored paint and fabric because darker colors will absorb the heat and lighter colors will reflect the heat instead of absorbing it.,4
153864,you should use light colored options  because it doesn't absorb heat like dark colors do.,3
153923,I chose that because using a dark colored one will make it hotter.,2
153928,"I decided to pick those choices because I learned that darker color will attract more radiation ad heat, that will create hot convection inside.",3
153909,"Light colors in general reflect the suns radiation back to the sun, but dark colors do the opposite they attract heat. That's why she need a light color paint and cloth rather then a dark paint and cloth.",4
153913,Because if the black of the car arackes the heat and makes the car hot inside.,2
153917,it usually doesn't get that hot,2
153916,Lighter colors reflect heat and don't absorb heat.,4
153935,I said to have a light fabric on the inside and a light paint on the outside because dark colors attract the heat and the light colors deflect the heat.,3
153922,i chose light colored paint because light colors reflect the sun,3
153921,Dark colors absorb heat but light colors don't. If you have a dark color it would adsorb the heat and make it hotter inside.,3
153911,light colored things don't attract as much heat unlike dark colored things,2
153930,If you use a light reflective color on your car it can reflect off the heat and make sure the car does not get overheated.,3
154112,Dark colors are more attractive to heat because last summer I had a black shirt and got really hot and my friend work a pink shirt and she didn't get as hot.,2
153926,Black attracts the sun and if you paint your car black the heat wont go inside the car. Sp if there is black fabric it will attract the heat into the inside of the car.,2
153908,A light colored fabric so the inside of the car doesn't get that hot and traps in heat.,2
153905,"Dark colors attract  heat. If it is a light color, than it will be cooler.",2
153918,since black absorbs heat I would think its beter,3
153906,Light colors don't absorb heat as much as Dark colors.,3
153919,I chose dark colored paint on the outside because radiation and heat have a harder time getting through darker things.,3
153914,"Th color on the inside and the outside have to be liht because dark colors attract the sun. Even if the color on the outside is light, and the inside color is dark, the dark coor on the inside can attract the sun through the windows.",2
153927,because so it will stay cool on the inside.,2
154135,because it will stop the heat longer because it is thicker than the white color  fabric so it will reflect,2
154124,I think the light colored things would be better because dark things abs,3
154132,Dark colors attract heat unlike colors like white.,2
154162,it would get more sun heat,2
154134,She should have a light-colored car with a light-colored fabric on the inside because sunlight is attracted to dark-colored objects.,3
154153,so the sun light will reflect.,4
154118,dark colors absorb the sun sunlight.,4
154155,"it will keep the car cooler , because dark colors like black, wil get hotter.",2
154119,You use a dark color on the outside because the heat will be blocked out by the dark color. The light color will help the car be cool.,2
154130,i chose that becuse it can depend on the sun,2
154150,i would use a dark colored paint because the darker the color it wouldn't go threw the shield.,2
154122,So the sunlight won't heat up the car like the metal part of the belt could burn you,3
154127,I chose light paint because darker colors absorb heat better than light colors and that means the paint won't absorb a lot of heat and energy therefore keeping it cool.,4
154143,because light color does not attrack the sun unlike the dark color soes,2
154128,Light is attracted to dark colors so by using light colors your car will not be as open to the radiation.,3
154141,You want to have a light-colored car so the sun won't see it as much. If you have a dark-colored car the sun can see it more directly.,2
154145,I chose a light colored car because it won't the sun wont hit the car that hard.,2
154208,Light is more reflective and will reflect heat.,3
154202,"Because black traps heat, that would not help your car stay cool.",2
154193,The outside does not matter because the heat is going inside so the fabric will get hot in the car when you sit down.,2
154200,well using a light color will help the car maintain cool because light colors woun't atract the sun as much as dark colors,2
154206,If you used dark colored paint or fabric it will attract heat.,2
154212,i think this because the solar oven that has the most heat had black paper inside so to get the oposite i did light colored paper.,3
154214,because light colors reflect heat and don't absorb heat.,4
154218,well if you have like a tan on the inside then it won't attract the sun but if u have black fabric then it will get warm because black attracts the sun.,2
154221,using a dark material will attract heat.,2
154226,I picked this becuse if she uses the light olered one it's going to attract the sun.,2
154217,it will not be hot in there if you put a shade in front your seat will not get hot,2
154199,I chose all light colored because darker colors attract heat while lighter colors do not attract heat or the sun.,2
154198,The heat will bounce off it and not get hot.,3
154215,Because if u use it in the outside it could fall or it could be stolen. And also becaue if you use a dark color it atracts the sun even more and make the car more hot and plus if you use a light color it bounces off.,3
154196,I choice this because using light colors and light colored fabric will not extract as much heat as it might if you use a dark color.,2
154201,The sun will not affect the light colored seats.,2
154205,Use a light colored car because the color black absorbs heat and that's why you don't want a black colored car or a black fabric.,3
154197,Black absorbs more heat from light.,4
154204,It is better to use a light colored fabric because it will keep the sun out.,2
154195,"First of all, dark colors attract sunlight, so the 2 and 4 answers would not work. Secondly, light colors repel heat energy. The answer must be 1 or 3. I think it is one because that would allow the heat to not enter in the first place. If the dark colored paint on the outside attract the heat, by the time it wants to escape because of the light seats, it would already be trapped.",3
154311,if you put the fabric pn the car it prevents the heat gose in side and dark fabric is much better because is not going to reflect,2
154322,when darker colors are in the sun they are hotter or they get hotter but lighter colors will make it cooler.,2
154310,I think both because the fabric will block the sun and make it reflect .It might depend on light or dark but i think the dark one will work because the construction paper.,3
154327,The light paint/fabric will reflect off the sun's heat.,3
154326,light color does not attract heat and the dark colors do.,2
154324,White reflects heat so if everything is white it should keep heat away better than black will. Black attracts heat.,3
154319,I beleive this because darker colered things absorb more radiation from the sun and I know that becuse I have read it in science articles and been told off my brother. (Went to OSU),4
154343,light colors dont obsorb heat like dark colors (black),3
154307,I think that she should use light-colored paint on the inside and outside because if you use dark colored paint then the it will get hot because dark always makes it hot.,2
154371,because if you se black it attracts heat and if you put a ligth color it does not get that much heat.,2
154353,the light paint will keep it cool other than dark paint,2
154336,becuse light ones dont heat up,2
154325,"Using black fabric and paint will make the car hotter, the color will absorb heat quicker if it is a dark color because it is dark and dark colors don't deflect heat as well as light colors do. Light colors will deflect heat more because of their brightness.",4
154329,Light colors because if you have dark colors they will heat up alot more than lighter colors.,2
154323,black atracts heat,2
154345,Dark colors gather more heat than light colors and paint also gathers more heat than fabric,2
154703,I think that using lighter color will work better because with a darker it would heat up more in the car than with lighter color,2
155334,Because it can reflect the sun light from getting the car hot.,4
153836,Light colored materials such as paint and fabric attract less solar radiation than darker materials do.,3
153834,Dark colors attract heat and will make the car hotter.,2
153863,Because if the outside was darker reflecting up it will get heat to no come in. And if you use light color fabric in the inside it wont attract the sun light.,3
153843,because the dark colors attract the heat so the light colors won't,2
153826,Light colors don't attract heat as much as dark colors.,2
153848,"The lighter the color is, the less the sun gets attracted too. So when you have a dark shirt and your walking outside you will feel much more heat than when your outside and wearing lighter color shirt.",2
153835,"laura should use a light colored fabric on the inside to the car because heat is attracted to dark colors , so if Laura uses a light colored fabric then the heat will not be so attracted to her car.",2
153860,I chose this because if it is a light color it won't attract the sunlight as much as a dark.,3
153827,Light colors do not attract heat as much as dark do so if her car has light colored fabric and has a light colored paint the amount of heat that attracted torwards the car is not that much compared,2
153830,Use light-colored fabric and paint because dark fabric and dark paint will absorb heat which will make the car really hot.,3
154514,light colored fabric on the inside of the car blocking the windows so the car will have a light shade and make it cooler inside,2
153859,lighter colors keep things cool,2
153832,light colors reflect the sun better.,3
153854,If you use dark fabric on the inside the sun will  immediately see the dark fabric and that will cause to heat up the car. So if you use light colored fabric the car will not get as hot.,2
153839,If you have a dark color on he inside and outside of our car it will attract the car and absorb the heat.,3
153818,Light colored material reflect more light an energy than dark colored materials.,4
153915,the light colered is better for cooler air .,2
153925,well if it is black it will absorbe the heat,3
153912,Dark colors get hotter than lighter colors. Dark colors attract radiation and lighter colors don't.,3
153924,because the light colors would make them go a way,2
153936,using a light color,2
154148,Because i know if i use black colored fabric or paint on the car it will go hotter.,2
154152,because my mom has one and it keeps the scar cold.,2
154160,because dark colored paint makes something hotter.,2
154157,If you use darker colors it will make it hotter.,2
154147,I chose these answers because dark colored objects attract more heat then light colored objects.,2
154159,dark coler atracts heat.,2
154161,The reason that i said it was that f you use a light color the car can get really hot.,2
154146,I have picked a lighter color because in the solar oven if you have a darker color it will stay with it and it will heat up super fast so chose a ligter color and the sun will not go after it.,3
154211,I chose both lights because dark's absorb heat and lights reflect heat.,4
154210,I chose this because the light colors will reflect and most likely won't absorb any heat.,4
154318,i think a light colored paint because so it wont heat up and light colored fabric because the car wont get hotter.,2
154330,"because, it will reflect of the light color and",3
154194,The dark color paint will absorb most of the energy will the fabric will reflect more energy out of the car making it as cool as posible,5
149950,Because the sun reflects off bright colors.,3
149966,Dark things attract the light and make it hotter.,2
149972,"Light colored paint will prevent most heat form entering the car because it's reflective.  Dark colored fabric on the inside, will let the heat escape more easily than light colored fabric.",3
149959,because the colored fabric on the inside of the car will block out the sun,2
149953,The lighter things attracts less heat so it is not as hot or too hot.,2
149970,Light colors don't attract sun light.,2
149590,because ussaly dark soaks up the heat,3
149956,Light stuff never really gets that hot,2
149961,it does not attract sunlight,3
149588,"I picked the third one because if you put a light color in the inside, the it will reflect off it and won't get the car hot.",3
149955,i think this because the sun observes more that dark colors,2
149967,so the sun cant get trough,2
150648,I choose both of the light answers because dark colors obsorb heat.,3
149965,I know that if anything is dark it creates more heat in the car.,2
149954,because it a dark colored paint witch would work perfectly,2
149962,dark color on the out side can block some of the heat,2
,,1
,,1
149971,the car does not want to get hot.,2
150065,"Light colors, such as white reflect the sun's rays, keeping the car cooler than a black car with dark leather because black and other dark colors absorb heat.",5
150066,I think it is the light colored stuff because i know that if you where black than you are going to be hot. So it is like the same thing with cars if you lay dark colored stuff on it or inside of it. It will heat up.,3
150074,Bright colors reflect light but dark colors absorb light and heat.,5
150076,I think using light-colored paint and light-colored fabric would be the best options while it sits out in the sun because the darker colors attracts heat.,3
150073,Dark colors attract heat,2
150078,Dark colors attract the sun. So that means light colors don't.,3
150072,I chose light colored because the sun doesn't affect light.,2
150075,"When using a light color the heat reflects off it, but when using a dark color it absorbs the heat.",4
150077,"Light colors prevent heat from going inside and creating conduction. Dark colors take the heat and seal it so that it goes inside. So if your car is hot, it's probably because you have dark colors on the inside and/ or outside.",4
150069,"This is true because when  a black or dark colored car is in the sun, it gets really hot inside and on the outside.  But with a white or light colored colored car is left in the sun, it isn't as hot inside and out.",2
151162,I think using the dark fabric will be a lot harder for the hot air to come in the car.,2
150052,I picked that one because if you use dark fabric it will just get hotter .,2
150067,because dark attracts the sun and light does not,2
150063,I chose my answer  because light colors reflect heat.,3
150056,You want a lighter color because black atracks a lot of heat which gets hotter faster than the color white.,2
150061,I chose light colored fabric and light colored paint because the heat will bonce off of the car.,3
150059,it would help cover it.,2
150062,I think that she should use dark colored paint on the outside because if u use light colored paint it will make her car hot.,2
150064,Well the color is black it takes heet if its light it is cooler.,2
150079,Because then on the inside the ligth colored fabric will reflect the sun not atract the sun.,3
150053,the sun is attracted to dark colors. So if you use light colors the sun wont be as attracted to them as it would be for a dark color,3
150054,Light-colored objects can reflect the light or keep it from getting warm.,4
150055,i think u should use an dark-colored painted outside because then it wont get hot inside the car .,2
150058,light is the best becose it donse not anrge het,2
150060,Heat soaks into darker colors.,3
150071,The black fabrick will not heat up  because it would be like shade.,2
150085,I chose these answers because I have learned previously that light fabrics or materials don't absorb as much heat as dark colored fabrics.,3
150104,the fabric wont get so hot when it is the out side of the car is hot,2
150101,I chose dark colored paint and dark colored fabric because the darkness of the two items effect the sun rays by deflecting the car.,3
150105,"I think she should use light paint, and light material because dark atracts heat and light doesn't .",3
150109,"She should use a light colored paint on the outside because if you use a light colored paint, it will reflect the heat.",3
150086,it keeps shade in from getting hot,2
150097,I think thats the best choice because it will block heat.,2
150114,it dose not mack your car hot and when she comes back it will be cold,2
150094,dark collers conduct heat,3
150082,If the color of the paint should be light because if the color was dark then that means that it will attract the sun. You want light colored seats so they don't fade and it won't attract heat.,3
150090,because dark colors like black attract the sun,2
150092,dark ofodes the dark,2
150113,the heat wil go in,2
150111,because dark coalars atracks heat like black,2
150112,its because the lite bounces off.,4
150096,light color does not brag sun because sun go to dark,2
150132,"I chose Using a light-colored paint on the outside"" because usually white colors do not attract the sun",3
150133,If you use light color fabric on the inside it will get less hot because dark colors attract sun light,3
150130,Dark colors get warmer faster.,3
150127,I think if it is a darker color the sun will attract to it more rather then if she has a lighter colored car.,3
150117,I picked the dark because he dark can reflect off the black fabric or paint,2
150115,It keeps it cool.,2
150124,Darker things absorb heat will lighter colored things dont atract heat.,4
150131,"It should be light colored paint and light colored inside fabric because light colors don't attract the sun towards you. Therefore, if you are using dark colored fabrics and dark colored paint, the sun will attract to you.",3
150134,"I chose the light colored seats and car because if you have black seating, it obsorbs the heat.",3
150145,The paint will block of the sun light that wants to get out,3
150137,I chose those answers because the sun will go to darker colors mostly black. But using light colors it will prevent this from happening.,3
150149,Black and other dark colors make everything way more warms o having a light colored paint and fabric will make it so the sun doesn't give off more heat because white doesn't make anything more hot.,2
150140,I chose the light colored paint and fabric so Laura's car won't heat up during the summer.,2
150122,I chose light colored car paint and light colored fabric because light colors ubsorb less heat.,3
150123,I choose to go with the light paint and light fabric because dark things attract the heat.,2
150138,So the seats don't get hot.,2
150136,"If I'm correct, black fabric or black itself attracts the sun and therefore causes the object or person wearing a piece of cloth that is black to heat up in time.",3
150142,dark attracts and light doesn't,2
150116,Dark color attracts heat while light color does not so much.,3
150148,i choose light things because the sun just beams off of light clothes.Dark clothes soak up all the heat,4
150128,"Light colors reflect heat, so the car would stay cooler on the inside because it would reflect the suns rays.",4
150144,Dark conducts heat light doesn't conduct heat,3
150516,Laura should use light colored paint because it doesn't atracted to the sun as much,2
150143,sun shines on dark colored thing but reflects off light colored things.,3
150146,I learned that when a car is painted black it causes the heat from the sun to be collected inside the car and also with fabric so the car must have light colored fabric in the inside out the car.,3
150195,I think she should use light-colored paint and light-colored fabric because light-colored things reflect the sun.,3
150200,I chose those because when the color is light it reflects,3
150198,The reason is because on the car a dark colored paint will atract more hear as wear a light colored paint will not as much.,3
150158,Because black turns get hot because its a dark color,2
150159,If you have light colored fabric in your car then it won't be hot.,2
150153,light colors don't obsorb heat as well as dark colors,4
150162,"Well, I get my choice by thinking in my head (A.K.A thinking)",2
150173,I think it should be dark colored paint on the outside of the car because when it is darker is is cooler.,2
150164,I picked  light color everything because light color is easier for wind to get in.,2
150178,You could put fabric or a blanket to cover the sun.,2
150166,I think this is true bacause light colors will allow heat in the car but dark colors wont.,2
150160,I chose that because if the car color is light then the car wont heat up as much because the sun tries to heat dark things mostly.,2
150155,well darker things trap all the heat so you want lighter things if you want to keep your car cool.,3
150172,"I chose this because dark items obsorb heat and light colored items deflect heat,",4
150163,this is ture because if you wear blake you get really hot and if you wear white you get less hot so there for light paint and light seats are better,2
150157,because darker collers atract heat,2
150174,Because it is dark so the sun won't shine.,2
150167,The car will reflect the sunlight and keep cool inside.,4
150168,"Why I chose the light colored answers is because light colored objects, reflect the sun and does not heat up.",3
150170,i think she should use a light colored paint because it's not gonna look as bad if it fades over time.,2
150199,You would need this because dark colors and paint atrract the sun so the sun beats down on it but with light color and fabric it make the sun not tuch the car/it dosent attract.,3
150196,d,1
150156,jzvd.,1
150243,I chose this because the dark-colored paint will not heat up as fast because of the color and she shouldn't use fabric because it will make it even hotter inside because fabric is warm.,2
150204,The darker the color the more heat it takes in.,2
150244,Cause if you have dark paint the car will get hotter and hotter.,2
150219,"I chose  to use light colored fabrics and paint because light colors reflect heat, whereas darker colors tend to absorb the heat, making the temperature hot.",4
150231,the light will relflect the sun.,3
150236,Using light color because dark colors attract the sun.,2
150246,IT matters about the color because as an example black picks up radiation.,4
150240,"She should use light colored fabric and light colored paint for her car because darker colors attract more heat, whereas lighter colors don't.",3
150242,"Dark colors absorb heat, while light colors absorb less than dark colors. So it would be rejecting more heat.",4
150218,Light colored things don't get hotter faster.,2
150208,I think this will help because dark things will most likely heat up faster so it will heat the cars up.,2
150235,Light colors will keep the car cooler because dark colors absorb sunlight.,4
150220,I think that you need light colored paint on the ouside and light colored fabric on the inside so it does not collect the heat that much.,2
150228,the light colored paint reflects the suns reflection,3
150230,sun and heat reflect of light colors.,3
150203,Because the metal.,2
150248,I picked this because then it won't reflect that much.,3
150237,the lighter the color the less the heat comes in,2
150221,The sun is attracted to dark objects.If you want it to stay cool use light things.,2
150206,well light colores dont atract the sun,2
150247,because the light reflects of light colers,4
150215,well if you use a whit coler car the sun will reflect of the car,3
150239,its hotter if u wear black and darker colors so if you  put a darker color around your car it will be hotter so if she choses a lighter color it won't be as hot.,2
150207,The light colors will prevent the heat from absorbing.,3
150238,I think using the light colored fabric on the inside of the car would work because it could block heat from getting into the car.,2
150202,If it is light colored it will stay cool.,2
149590,sometimes the sun atracts the black colors so she should us the white paint.,3
150648,using light colored things will not absorb the heat like dark colored things.,4
149953,THe lighter the color the less heat it attracts.,2
150071,Dark colors do not take the light as the green colors.,2
151162,dark is like a cold chill so it will be chilly.,2
150067,Because light colored paint does not attract sun light,3
150134,Light doesn't absorb the heat as much as dark does.,4
150123,I choose the light colored ones because the dark ones attract heat and absorbs it.,3
150128,"Since light colors reflect heat, it would be important to have light colored elements in the car.",3
150136,"Dark material attracts the sun, while lighter materials don't attract it.",2
150122,I chose light colored paint and fabric because light colored stuff reflects heat instead of absorbing it like dark colored things do.,3
150135,I used the light coloer fabric because the light colors are better the  dark makes more heat and light colors dose not.,2
150231,this will relflect all the heat.,3
150247,because dark colors atract light.,3
150215,if you have bright coler car it will reflect,3
149959,because if we used dark colored fabric it will absorb light and make the car hotter,4
149970,dark colors attract heat.,2
149967,because the light colors have less effect on the car,2
149957,"she should use light color paint on the outside and light fabric inside,because light colored stuff bounces light off because it is already light.While dark colored stuff absorbs the hot light,and that makes it hot.",5
149961,light and light will not absorb the heat,3
149954,so the sun does not hit the window for it to heat up,2
150073,Dark colors attract the heat .,2
150078,Dark attracts the sun.,2
150077,"Light colors don't absorb much heat, unlike dark colors that do. The light colors will prevent the sun from heating up too much.",4
150062,"I chose light colored fabric because if you use dark colored fabric, it will absorb more heat so light colored fabric does not absorb as much heat as dark colored fabric.",4
150076,I think using a light-colored paint on the outside is important to keep the car cool while it sits in the sun because using dark colored paint will absorb more heat than light-color ones.,4
150130,dark colors heat up faster than light colors.,3
150115,The light colors reflect the heat.,3
150149,Dark colors attract heat so i think having a light color would attract less heat to the inside and outside of the car.,2
150125,"You should use light-colored fabric because if it's black and then you sit on it, it could burn you. You should also use light-colored paint or else your car will be so hot from the black paint attraction.",2
150124,I did light colors inside and out because dark things attract heat.,2
150177,"White is better, because black extracts heat,and since there is black on the outside and black on the inside it is going to get twice as hot.",2
150178,I choose the dark colored fabric because the car won't get hot.,2
150198,Based on my experience using light colors usally help with car heat problems.This is because dark colors actract heat.,2
150175,I chose using a light colored fabric because it will block the heat and also because its a light colored fabric it will not absorb as much heat as a dark colored fabric.,4
150161,I reflects the sun.,3
150196,if you do  have dark it would it gets hotter,2
150202,Using light colors will not absorb the heat.,4
150172,I chose light colors cause dark colors absorb heat,3
150226,If Laura gets dark color on the outside such as black or blue it will attract heat,2
150204,Dark colors attract more heat then lighter colors so if you don't want your car to get hot use warmer colors.,3
150223,You would put something like black on the outside of the car because the color will capture any heat that is trying to get in and the light color in the car is because if the black color fails then the light fabric will reflect the heat out of the car.,3
150145,it will not let light get in the car because its dark,2
149968,The dark atraks the sun.,2
149966,Light colors do not attract sunlight as much as darker colors do.,3
149963,"I chose those two answers because anything with a light color like white, reflects of the heat from the sun, so it doesn't get as hot as dark colored things.",4
149586,It is because the lighter it is the less heat there is.,2
149958,I think it is important to have light colored paint because first of all it is what is covering most of the showing parts on the car and second because dark attracts the heat so light does not.,3
149589,"White does not attract sun, unlike black.",2
149951,heat doesn't attract to light colors,2
149588,"Using light colored fabric will not keep the sun in, but it will let the heat reflect off the light colored fabric.",4
149956,Light colors will not really get that hot compared to dark colors like black the sun will reflect off the black car making it hot. With light colors the sun wont reflect off the car with light colors making it not as hot.,2
149587,"Laura should use light colored paint and fabric because dark colors attract heat and if she wants to keep her car cool, she must have light colors.",3
149962,This will attract less heat,2
149972,Having two layers of light-colored things will let minimal heat in.  Any heat that gets in won't get absorbed into the car because there is light-colored fabric.,3
149960,the light color stuff reflects hot air away.,3
150217,"I think that Laura should use light colored fabric on the inside of her car, because it will not reflect heat too much, and dark paint will. I think that Laura should use a light colored paint on the outside because it will not let the heat reflect on the outside, unlike dark paint, dark paint will.",2
150065,"Light colors reflect heat, so she should have light colored thing inside and outside of your car.",3
150079,Because the sun will reflect off of it and not on it.,3
150061,I chose light colors because light colors reflects heat. So if you have light colors in and on your car your car won't get so hot when it's in the sun.,3
150060,Heat is especially attracted to dark colors so you want to use a light colored fabric so your car does not heat up inside.,3
150053,the sun is attracted to dark colors like black and dark blue the sun is less attracted to brighter lighter colors.,2
150063,Light colors reflect light so not as much heat will be absorbed meaning the car will not get too hot.,4
150052,I chose that because any other color will make it hotter then it is.,2
150074,This will keep the light from coming through the windows were it is most likely to stop heat from being trapped in the car.,2
150055,using a dark color in the outside cause  if u put it inside  will get hot but if u put it outside it wont get hot .,2
150064,light colors don't attract heat,2
150057,I did not choose dark because darker colors absorb more heat.,3
150056,The color black absorbs heat and gets hotter quicker and the color white takes longer to get hotter.,3
150070,Because dark colors attract heat more than lighter colors so that is why she should use lighter colors inside and outside of the car,3
150075,Light colors reflect heat off of it.,3
150054,"Light colors inside can help support heat, and using black for the outside can also help by extracting heat from outside.",2
150058,she sod us the light fabric and the light coloer becas it what to hot.,2
150111,because it wont get hot,2
150108,hit was 84C,1
150082,The darker the color is the more it attracts the sun if the car is lighter it will attract less sun.,3
150083,I would use it so the sun doesn't get shine on the car.,2
150127,She should use lighter colored paint because darker colors are more likely to attract the sun more.,2
150117,I picked light colored paint in the outside and light colored fabric in the inside because I think that light colors will not let the heat go in the car. I think it will just bounce off the car and it won't be hot.,3
150516,Using light colored paint and a light color fabric for the inside and outside will keep your car cool because the sun doesn't attrach to light colors as much as it does to dark     colors.,3
150137,You want to use lighter colors because the sun is attracted to dark colors. So to avoid your car from getting hot you must put some sort of light color on the outside and the inside of the car.,2
150133,"I chose, using light-colored fabric on the inside of the car, because if you use dark colored fabric it will heat up more and the the heat would heat up the air. If you use light colored fabric on the inside of the car it will conduct less heat.",3
150118,light colors can reflect heat instead of absorving them.,4
150121,why is that the car yes needs a different color but i don't think that's the main reason why it's so hot beacuse when my dad's car sits in the sun its bright color green but when we get in it it's really hot beacuse the seats are dark brown so it would contrap more heat from outside to inside.,3
150116,light color paint will not attract heat like dark colored paint. The light color will repel a little.,3
150141,Because if you use black paint it will attract more heat,2
150120,black absorbs heat,3
150132,Light colored things do not attract the sun. It won't get as hot as the dark colored paint that actually attracts the sun.,3
150167,Light will reflect heat.,3
150168,Why I chose the second answer and the light-colored color and fabric is because with light colored color and fabric the sun will reflect and not heat up the car.,3
150170,I think she should use a light colored fabric in the car because if you used a dark colored fabric in the car it will get hot because darker colors absorb more heat.,3
150158,Because The sun goes to darker colors like black,2
150173,Light color does not attract heat so the car would not get so hot.,2
150162,You have to use light colors because then the car wont heat up as much if it where to be a car with a light color paint & dark fabric or dark paint w/ light fabric.,2
150155,well dark colors like black for example attract a lot of heat so if you don't want your car to get hot then use a light colored paint on the outside.,2
150174,The light paint will deflect the heat.,3
150156,bro,1
150199,"Dark would not work because the sun is attracted to dark colors, not light colors.  So the sun will bounce off the light colors.",3
150176,"The lighter the color of choice is, the less heat it will attract.",2
150235,Light fabric and paint are better for keeping a car cool in the sun because dark colors will absorb heat and make the car hot.,3
150241,I chose to have a light color on the inside  and a dark color on the outside because  when you have a light color on the inside it will reflect the heat from the inside back to the outside.,3
150207,Light colors tend to not absorb heat as well as dark colors. Therefore the car will not absorb heat very much.,4
150206,well the light colors reflects the sun and that may help for her.,3
150221,If the fabric or the car is dark-colored the sun will be more attracted to the car and act as a solar oven and get hot.If the fabric or car is light-colored the sun will be less attracted to the car and it will become less hot.,3
150208,It will keep the car cooler to have a light color paint and fabric because the dark colors have a bigger chance of trapping heat inside of the car.,3
150246,Its lighter paint and color because dark colors absorb heat .,3
150244,Using light calor things on the car will keep it nice and cool.,2
150249,I see many people use it on the inside of the windshield.,2
150205,i said using light colored fabric inside because the leather cause the heat get more hotter inside.,2
155700,"Dark colors draw in the sun,so painting the and putting fabric of a dark color on the car will make it more hot.",2
150228,the sun will reflect from the windshield,3
150218,Light colored things attracted the heat,2
150242,"The bright colors reflect heat, while dark ones absorb more heat.",4
150203,If you use a dark color it will atrack heat but when you have a light fabric it does not atrack heat.,3
150240,Dark colors attract more heat.,2
150248,So the car won't burn.,2
150237,the lighter the color the less heat  thats comes to it,2
150219,"Laura will want a light colored car because then it will not absorb heat, it will reflect it.",4
150220,The darker material receives more radiation than the white material.,3
150243,I chose light colored because black colored heats up things.,2
150230,My choice is keep the car light colored because heat reflects off light.,3
150238,the light fabric on the inside of the car might protect the car from heat and reflect it out in the open.,3
150245,"I chose this because the lighter the paint, the less heat it will absorb.",3
150214,A lighter color will not attracted  the sun.,2
150239,The darker the color the more the heat gets attarcted to it the lighter the color the heat does not get attracted as much.,3
150236,Light color because dark colors attract the sun and light colors let the sun just go by.,2
150201,I think you need to use light colors because  the barker of the color the hotter it gets.,2
150197,I chose these because dark colors attract heat.,2
150163,because light colored things reflect heat,3
150159,If you have a light color on the inside and outside of your car its most likely it will be cooler then a dark colored car.,2
150160,Use light colored paint because the suns heat targets dark things.,2
150165,I chose using a light colored fabric on the inide of the car becasue if the sun id beating on the seats uf they are a fur seat the sun will make it hotter and the car ill juet hotter and hotter. If it ha a leather seat it wont attract the het as much.,2
150154,If you use light-colored paint doesn't attract heat.,2
150166,Because light colors dont make things heat up much like dark colors.,2
150131,"Dark colored fabric is known to contract heat energy. If she doesn't want to make her car hot by the end of the summer, then she can use all light colored fabric or paint.",3
150139,I chose this because darker colors attract more heat and lighter colors does not attract not much heat.,2
150140,It'll be easier to use light-colored fabric so it won't let the inside of the car get too hot.,2
150144,Black attracts heat so if she doesn't want her car to heat up she can use light colors and light fabrics.,2
150143,This is because dark colors attracks the sun.,2
150119,I think she should use a dark colored fabric because so the heat goes to fabric and not in the car.,2
150129,lighter colers do not atract the sun but darker colers do.,2
150148,light colors reflect the heat off of things while dark colors absorb the heat,4
150142,she doesnt want her car to get hot,2
150138,It will bounce off the light fabric back at the sun.,3
150090,because dark colors attract the sun.,2
150089,I chose A and C because they both represent light colors. I know that light colors reflect the sun and dark colors obsorb the sun.,4
150098,This is because the color black or darker colors attract the sun and the color white or lighter colors reflect the sun.,3
150093,I think light colored paint because if you use white then it will move away from the sun and if you use dark colors like black then that will attract the sun.,3
150114,the black thing orsevers the heat,3
150086,white is a cool color,2
150106,the lighter colored white one keeps the inside cold instead the metal one makes it hot,2
150069,You would need a light colored car because dark colors attract and absorb heat. I know this because my dads car is always outside on the seats are dark colored.  It is always hot when you get in.,3
150066,Well i picked both that has to do with light because black paper and paint will absorb the heat not reflect the heat.,4
150072,I chose light colored objects because the sun doesn't go on light colored objects often.,2
150059,it will help heat reflect off.,3
149964,"She should use light colored paint on the inside and outside of her car, because it will attract less sunlight.",3
149950,The light colors are important because the reflect heat.,3
149955,I think this because heat only observes the dark stuff.,2
149947,The dark colored stuff will obsorb the heat,3
149965,Light colors won't observe that much heat compared to dark colors like black or dark gray.,4
149969,Darker colors soak up heat and get really hot.,3
150650,if you use light it will only get some heat,2
149971,lololo,1
150153,Light colors don't absorb heat as well as dark colors do,4
150195,She should use light colored paint and fabric because dark colors such as black attract the sun while light colors like with reflect the sun.,3
150194,I chose this because dark colors trap heat while dark ones dont.,3
150164,Dark colors absorb heat which is an example of conduction.,3
150200,I chose this because bright colors reflect the heat away.,3
150169,so it can work,2
150101,I chose using light colored fabric inside of the car because dark colored fabric is attracting heat but she doesn't want the car to be hot so the light colored fabric would deflect the heat from going inside the car.,3
150105,Laura should use light colors because dark colors attract heat.,2
150112,light colers bounce the light right off.,4
150085,"I chose my answers because black absorbs heat, making it hotter. White, on the other hand, reflects heat making it cooler.",5
150094,dark colers conduct heat,3
150109,I choose using a dark colored paint on the outside of the car because the dark colored paint will absorb the heat.,3
150080,well my mom has a black car and it gets super hot,2
150097,i chose the dark on the outside because the light part on the outside will attract heat.,2
150087,I chose this as my answer because I know that light colored things don't heat up as fast as dark things and I know that the paint dosen't have much to do with the tempature of the car.,2
150096,1 and 3 are my chocie because the sun would rectid to the sun,2
150104,the light fabric helps not attract the heat a dark color like black would attract the sun and get hot,2
150092,dark reflects,2
150919,because there are a lot of stuff,2
150924,it will block the sunlight from going in the car,3
151186,I dont know,1
151195,light colors reflect heat so if heat dose hit her car it will reflect onto another car or back at the sun,3
151182,because the dark color won't let the car burn,2
150923,because dark colors absorb more heat then light colors,3
151193,i dont know,1
151230,i think its using dark,2
151228,They use a light colored paint on the outside.,2
151217,i do not know,1
151227,i think its using dark colored fabric because the sun cant get trought fabric,2
151218,"i think it's because the dark tart attracts the sun so i don know why but black attracts the sun and and a light color doesn't""",2
151209,i dot no,1

150905,Light colors attract a lot less heat than dark colors do.,2
151224,Light colors such as white bounce or reflect sunlight. Some heat stays but it will not be as hot as where she uses black which absorbs heat,5
151204,if your car is a light color the sun will hit it less if you have a dark color car the sun will hit it more,2
151222,I think that using a dark colored fabric on the inside of the car would be best because what if it's windy out side and the fabric can fly away and if the fabric is on the inside of Laura's car it wouldn't fly away and then she wouldn't have to worry about her car being hot.,2
151212,I chose these answers because dark colors actually make things hotter and light colors make things less hotter.,2
151205,for example if you are wearing black clothes on a sunny day you are going to be really hot because black clothes suck up all the heat so then you would get really warm. It is the opposite if you wear light colored clothes or white colored clothes.,2
151216,if you use light colored paint the heat will not affect your car as much.,2
151203,if you put it on the car then heat get past it,2

151223,"The sun and heat bounces off of light things as for dark things, the heat is absorbed making it hot.",4
151208,Light colors block heat,2
151202,if it is dark the car won't get to hot,2
151206,Light colors like white and blue don't attract the sun but black and dark colors will and if the sun is attracted then it will get hotter.,2
151210,nose,1

151207,Its because dark colors hold in the heat light colors don't do so much of that.,3
151229,it coloers the car with the dark paint becuse it the dark paint coloer it by the the dark paint isorb the heat.,3
151192,Light colors will absorb less heat than darker colors in the same amount of time.,3
151188,I think this because if you are wearing  black shirt it is hotter.,2
151178,I chose there to be light colored fabric inside and outside because then it will reflect the heat.,2
150915,Dark colors absorb heat so I assume its the opposite with light colors.,3
151199,Using light colored paint  because dark colors absorb heat  but if it is lihgt it wont abosorb,3
151191,most cars are dark colerd.,2
151200,I chose those answers because dark colors attract the sun.,2
151165,when you put  the cooler color it  turns really cooler.,2
151194,i just guessed,1
150922,because darker things get hotter,2
150917,"The sun's radiation is attracted to darker colors. The car would get hotter if it had dark colors. The car will still get hot with light colors but if you had darker colors, the car would be really hot.",3
151176,Dark colors attract the sunlight.,3
151198,light colors reflect the sun and dark colors attract the sun.,3

150918,"I chose this answer because light colors are less likely to attract the sun, rather than a dark color like black or navy blue.",2
151190,dark colors attracte sun and light colors do not attract sun,2
151181,I chose that answer because using dark colored fabric will darken it.,2
151201,they make it cooler,2
150916,because if it is shiny it is gonna bounce the sun and it will heat the car.,2
151179,If she uses a darker color like black than the heat will be lured to the car heating it up more,2
151225,so the sun does not shine in the car,2
150909,You would not want to do dark colors because darkness attracts the sun and light colors dont.,2
150902,The sun would hit the car and bounce off of the roof because the paint is dark.,3
150900,Because light colors don't attract heat.,2
150910,Because if you put black paint it will make it hotter.Because black attracts heat.,2
150919,if it is darck colered then the sun is going to  be aterativ to it,2
150899,"I choose my answer because heat bounces off the light colors instead of dark colors, because dark colors absorb heat.",5
150905,"The fabric in a car is very important to how hot the car is. If it is light, it will not attract as much heat.",2
151216,Because if you have a light colored paint on the outside then you will not have heated car because light colores have a less atractive color to the heat.,2
151208,I chose light colored fabric because it will reflect out of the car.,3
151225,helps to cool down the car,2
151229,the dark color does not heat the car,2
150917,"The sun gets attracted to dark colors, so the inside of the car would be cooler if you use lighter colors.",2
151190,if you use a dark color on the outside than it will attract heat and make the car hot. Therefore using a light colored paint on the outside will not make the car hot and will keep it cool.,2
150921,Black absorbs all light and turns it into heat but white does not.,5
151176,Light colors make the sun reflect off it. Dark colors attract the sun.,3
150918,"I chose this answer because light colors and fabric do not attract the sun, but dark colors do.",2
151179,It better to use light colors because dark colors will attract more light.,3
151177,I think that because the color black reflects the sun and if you put it over the car then it will get hot but if you put like a light color then it doesnt reflect the sun so the car wonldnt get too hot.,2
151174,if u use a dark covered fabric and color it will attract the sun,2
151200,I chose those answers because dark color atrack heat and light colors don't.,2
151196,Because black absorbs heat,3
150908,light paint and fabric because if it is dark it will absorb the heat in the car.,3

151231,light colors do not attract heat.,2
151209,i dot no,1
151223,The light paint and fabric will have the heat bounce off instead of being trapped.,3
151210,nose,1
151181,I chose using dark-colored fabric  because the darkness brings in cool air,2
151182,She should use light color in the outside because if she uses dark her car will capture heat instead.,2
151192,I have heard that lighter colors don't absorb as much heat and therefore it wouldn't be as hot.,3
151199,I know why because it is an way of life,1
151186,Light colors do not atract heat,2
150915,I chose light colored fabric because the color black attracts heat.,2
151193,because you would get that reflected to other object.,2
150916,If its other color it could come through the color would be shining and heating the car.,2
151205,black colored things suck up the heat from the sun.,2
151206,Dark colors attract the sun.,2
151203,if you put dark more heat will transfer,2
151214,because it keeps it cool.,2
151212,I chose these answers because any other color than white would be more hot than usual. Black is the hottest color so it wouldn't be good for keeping your car cool.,2
151202,because the darker paint will make the sun refect away,2
151211,because dark color atrack heat.,2
151188,I think this because when i wear a black shirt all the heat soaks in and im hot so i know that Laura should do a light colored paint so that way if she does do a dark color then it will be soaked in heat.,3
151215,light colors do not attract the sun,2
151219,Because it will make the car not hit the sun,2
