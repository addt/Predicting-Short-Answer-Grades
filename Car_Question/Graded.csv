118529.0,it is warm because of the heat that was shined on the sun if it was longer in the sun it would have been more warmer,2
151214.0,i think its exactly as the outside because it might be leather and leather gets hot in the sun,2
118518.0,i think that it will be colder than the outside air because when it s hot outside your car is generally hotter than the air around you so i think that it will be colder in your car than the air around you,2
136408.0,whenever i enter my car on a cold day it is always colder i think it is colder because there is no heat reflecting and being absorbed through the window into the car,2
154205.0,the car was parked in the sunny spot and had heat and heated up quicker if he didn t drive the car,2
118571.0,well if the car has been in the cold environment for that day then it should have been the same temperature as outside,2
153863.0,i believe that the temperature would be warmer than the outside air because the outside air isn t touching the inside air because you aren t actually touching the inside air because everything that is around the car is blocking outside air to go in the inside of the car but the outside air would surround the outside air,2
118488.0,well usually when its hot outside the air in the car gets a littler warmer because the car is smaller in than the outside world and there are at least to people in a car depending on how big your car is,2
150139.0,it is warmer because the sun is shineing on the car,3
139862.0,the heat is trapped inside of the vehicle and the sun is going into the car while the heat does not escape the vehicle easily this increases the heat of inside the car,3
153838.0,it s warmer than outside air because the temperature in the car as differnt air than the outside air,2
136372.0,in a car the air gets in through the windows and the air vents which makes it colder because it goes through the air conditioner vent,2
136363.0,because the heat would be in the car and the cold air would only affect the outside of the car,2
150207.0,i think it will be warmer than the outside air because the car has been in the sun so it has been warming up for a week so it is colder than the outside air,3
136394.0,akbar s car is warmer than the outside air because it heat is trapped inside and was building up,3
150156.0,when the ac turns on then air is cold,2
118591.0,it will be hotter inside because the heat will be trapped inside,3
151203.0,its warmer then the outside air because if you parked your car in the sun and you don t have anything to make it get cooled down then of course it would and i know because it happened to me,2
118511.0,i think this answer because well if it cold outside and the car is parked in the sun then it would be the same tempater,2
150208.0,i think it will be colder than the outside air because the is sitting in the cold and the cold will get trapped in the car because there is no warm air in the car,2
154147.0,i chose this answer because if the car is insulated in the inside the it would be harder for he cold air it get into the car and since the car is parked on under the sun it gets warmer,2
149953.0,the warmness leaves the car and goes somewhere else and the cold is free to go in,2
151229.0,when the sun is shining at the car it heats in inside of the car,2
150053.0,i picked exactly the same as the air out side because if it has been sitting in the sun for a week it would heat up than cool down at night then when morning comes it would heat up again,3
118599.0,i think it is colder because when i get in the car in the morning it is cold,2
153981.0,since the car hasn t been driven for a week there is a lack of body heat inside the car also the engine hasn t been running for a while and that gives off heat to the car finally i have evidence from my personal life when i go on a week long trip to anywhere i leave my car in a parking lot so that it doesn t get stolen when my family and i get back from our trip our car is cold even though it has been sitting in the sun all week just because it was a cold morning night,2
154371.0,because it is like a spoon that has metal and metal burns in heat and the car is made out of metal so it will be really hot inside,2
154322.0,well i know that if it is sitting in the sun it will still get warmer eave though it is cold outside also i know that the heat from the sun is heating up the car or making it warmer but outside it is not getting as much heat as the car since it is parked in the sun,2
154154.0,i think the car would be warmer than the outside because the car has been siting in the sun for a week and has never been moved from the sun sense a week so the car would be super hot and out side would be warm,2
139496.0,the inside of the car would be colder because it is a cold day the cold air is seeping into the car and the coldness is being trapped inside,2
149970.0,the elements cancel each other out,2
118601.0,it would be warmer than the outside air because not all the cold air is being absorbed,2
118610.0,probably warmer because the car has been out in the sun for a week without the ac,2
151231.0,car is room temp outside is hot,2
150902.0,it would be exactly the same because if it is cold outside inside the car it would be cold to but not colder,2
118537.0,i think that it would be colder because the temperature can warm up with the sun outside but inside there is not anything to make it warm up with,2
118358.0,because the question said cold and hot so it is cold outside and warm inside the car,1
155700.0,it is a cold day but the car has been parked in the sun for a whole week the previous days might have been warmer,2
136475.0,akbar s car will be warmer than the outside air because they have not opened the car door in a week so all of the heat stays inside the car,3
118540.0,i choose this answer because the air inside the car con t get out because the car hasn t been driven for a long period of time and the windows are closed so the air can t get out,2
139511.0,because the car is made out of metal and being exposed to the cold outside air which cause the car to be cold and so is the inside of the car,2
150174.0,it says it has been driven for a week and it has been parked outside in a sun,2
154310.0,its going to be colder than the outside because the air is in the car the air moculos will cool down and will be in the car stuck the seats will be cold the cars engine can get it colder,2
136417.0,it is warmer because in the morning it cold sometimes so you put on the heater on and becomes warmer in side the car,2
118621.0,because it has been siting in there for a week in the sun and there is nothing to protect it from the heat so the car will probaly be warmer,2
154326.0,the car can not release he warm air,3
154846.0,i think the air outside will be warmer than the outside air because it had the sun going through the window for a week with all doors shut and no way of the hot air getting out,2
150902.0,i chose this answer because when it is a hot day your car is just like the outside weather,2
150143.0,i think its warmer than the outside air because it hasn t been driven for a week days,2
149959.0,because the car tempature will get hotter and colder because it is night time and night time is really cold,2
118520.0,because if the seats are leather it makes it hot,2
136395.0,since heat always travels to the colder object heat will transfer to the car until the car and the outside air are the same temperature,2
136468.0,its going to be the same because every day the temperature changes because one day its cold and one day its hot so at night it starts cooling down then at pm the sun starts to hotter and hotter and eventually the car stars to get hot,2
118402.0,it would be warmer because the sun has been hovering over the car for a week and the air would not effect the car because the sun is stronger then the air so it would be warmer,2
136390.0,i think that the air would be colder in the inside than the outside because on a cold day he parked his car in the sun and he has drove it a a week,2
136454.0,it is warmer than outside because it has not been used and all that heat that was in there has no way to get out,3
150076.0,although i am not sure for this question i think it is colder than the outside air because the car has not been driven for a week and so the temperature will be depended on the weather outside car s temperature can be changed easily the heat inside will escape leaving the cold air inside,2
118308.0,the sun shined on the parked car and the inside of the car would be warmer then the outside air,2
151208.0,it is in the sun so it is warmer,2
136580.0,i think that the the car would be warmer i think this because the sun would still be out and would be absorbing or reflecting the car just because the day is cold doesn t mean the inside would be the same temperature,2
150057.0,the engine was off so it was probably cold,2
118441.0,if the car had been driven that week the air would be the same but since it has not been driven for a whole week the car would be extra cold,2
150230.0,because the cold air can not get out of the car,2
118358.0,because when it is hot outside it is hotter in the car so it must be the same thing,2
136363.0,it s what s present not what happened prior to him walking to his car,2
136563.0,the hot air will counter act the colder air,2
118298.0,i think it is warmer than outside because it was sitting in the sun not being drivin for a week,2
151196.0,i think this because hot and cold combined is warm,2
150057.0,every time my parents park in the sun for a while it get s so hot and feels hotter than outside the sun heats it up,3
136482.0,because in that week if there was a hot day the car would of gotten hot then since the car is like an oven it would stay hot if it was hot on one of those days,2
154123.0,because there less space in the car so the cold air can travel around faster and get the inside cold and the cold air gets trap inside,2
154193.0,if the the day is cold and it is parked in the sun the sun won t effect the car since the air is cold,2
118438.0,if there were no windows open in abkar s car it would be normal room temperature in the car if it was cold outside it would have to be colder outside,2
154346.0,because the window are close and and the sun reflect on,2
136555.0,the heat will go in the car through the window and once the heat goes in it won t come out,2
118309.0,because if its a cold day then it will be realy cold,2
151227.0,i think its warmer outside air because the sun is outside and it warmes everything,3
139515.0,the air inside the car is warmer than the outside air because the outside air is affected by convection currents which cools it,2
118512.0,a car on a cold day is usually warmer than outside because the car is airtight so the cold air can t get in the car which is room temperature,2
136423.0,on cold days mycar is usuallycolder then the air outside,2
118296.0,his car should be warmer than outside because it has been out there doing nothing so it had given the car a chance to get really hot katie,2
150117.0,i picked colder than the outside air because it was a cold day if it has not been driven for a week then it would be cold just because it was parked in the sun doesnt mean that it will be warm in the night it could be cold in the morning it could still be cold with the sun barley peeking out,2
150244.0,because the sun is reflecting on it so it would get hotter,3
153927.0,because when the heat goes inside the car that is the heat,2
153985.0,i think it is colder because the engine hasn t been heated by getting turned on also it is a cold day so the car will get colder than normal,2
154204.0,if the car is in the sun the car it is going to be warmer because it is in the sun instead of it being in the shade where it is warme,2
149951.0,it will be cold because if it is cold on the outside it will be cold on the inside,2
150219.0,i chose this answer based on the fact that heat is stronger than cold air and also based this on personal experience,2
136511.0,because there is already air inside of the car and the reflection of the sun to the car windows are heating up the air in the car,2
153918.0,well since the car is protected and threres a heater i would think its hotter,2
150111.0,because if it was in the cold air outside it will be hotter in the car than outside,2
154323.0,i chose this because it depends if you run the air,2
150085.0,i chose this answer because the sun is warming up the air inside the car it doesn t matter whether the air outside is cold,3
118558.0,it is warmer because the sun is really hot and his car was outside so it is warmer in akbar s car,2
136480.0,because the car is outside in the hot sun with no windows rolled down and hand hasn t been opened up to get aired out so of course it s going to feel really hot,2
139861.0,it is hotter because the space is limited and the hot air will keep circulating around the car while outside the air has the whole atmosphere to rise up and cool,3
154335.0,i think its warmer than the out side because you may have some foarm of heat on and that will help pluss he sun can hit te glass and will go in the car but the heat can not ger out,3
151190.0,it will be the same because there is nothing to make it warmer or to make it colder,2
154198.0,his car was parked in the sun for a week and day when its cold so it ll be hotter inside,2
136355.0,i think that akbar s car will be hotter than the temperature outside because when my mom s car is out in the sun for a long time it tends to be hotter inside also depending on the car s color it will absorb more heat,2
118337.0,i chose my answer because on a normal temperature day the car would be warmer than the outside but the temperature was cooler than a normal day so the car was heated up by the sun but cooled down by the temperature of the air outside,1
153991.0,heat in the car has been heating up for days,2
136492.0,i think the air is cooler than outside because the person might be running the ac also might be because the gas in the tank might be causing the car to be cooler,2
118467.0,it is the same as the outside air because where ever the car is the air can go threw the car if the window is open,2
154334.0,becouse its locked and there is a heater,2
118408.0,because any sun would heat it up,2
118947.0,if the car is parked in the sun it should be hot but if it hasn t been driven in a week the engine would have cooled down by then thus cooling down the car,2
136565.0,it will be warmer then the outside air because the inside of the car has a roof and the outside would be colder because the air is less dense,2
153824.0,i beleive this because akbar s car might have been in the sun for a week but because it s a cold day that cooled the metal of the car which basically made the car refridgerator cooling the inside of the car,2
136426.0,because if you haven t driven your car in a week and the air outside is cold then it is the same temperature,2
136392.0,since the cold air outside is surrounding the car more then the car will conduct more of that cold air and get colder than the outside it s like when i get in the car to go to school and it s cold in the morning the car feels colder than the outside air,2
118345.0,this is the find because the car is not running so the cold air gathers on the inside this is because if you open the door the cold air will get inside and it will make the air colder,2
154340.0,the hot air stays in the car so it gets hot,3
150069.0,the inside of the car will be warmer than outside because he parked it the sun i know this because whenever i get into my dads car and its cold out the car always feels warmer than outside,2
150916.0,because you are inside the car the car has warm inside it,2
139775.0,because the air outside is colder than the heat emitted into the car the car is colder than the outside air,2
136378.0,the warm air from the days before the cold day would keep the car warm and the car will keep the air in and so the air would be warm for akbar when he gets in his car,2
118355.0,the heat that was already in the car is warmer than the outside and can not escape,2
136412.0,warmer beceause even if the car is white over a week it will most likely be warmer than the air outside,2
136362.0,the air particles can not spread around they are locked in the car and do not move around which will be warmer if they are locked in the sun went into the car and stayed in there,3
139843.0,equilibrium makes both inside of the car and outside the same temperature even though one feels colder than the other,2
118485.0,well i think that it is warmer than the outside air because it has been there for a week and its sunny outside and the heat from the sun shines into the windows and the car gets hotter,2
150125.0,i think it is the same because if it was in the sun but now in the cold i believe it balances out to the same as the outside air,2
151200.0,i think that is colder than the outside air because when i walk to my car on a cold day it is always colder than the outside air,2
118366.0,it was left in the sun and has not been driven so most likely the car is warm,2
153852.0,i chose the nd answer because the car was in front of the sun and made the car warm inside,2
154205.0,i believe the car will have warmer air then the outside air because the car hasn t been driven for a week when the car isn t driven the motor makes the car more warm,2
151230.0,i think its warmer outside air because the sun is outside and it warmes everything,3
136352.0,it can be warmer than the air outside because the car probably won t let the heat it collected out as easy and metal is a good conductor for heat so that would be why it is warmer,3
151181.0,it is exactly the same as the outside air because of condensation,2
118310.0,it would be the same temp than outside because its been outside and it was a cold day and the sun wouldn t change the temp inside the car because it was cold day and the cold weather would not change the weather inside,2
151212.0,the inside of the car is warmer than the outside the air because the outside of the car would be protecting the inside of the car mostly from the cold air outside of the car,2
139796.0,the heat inside the car has no way out,3
151190.0,it is a closed space so it will be warmer than outside,3
150086.0,well if it is cooler outside than its cooler inside the car,2
149964.0,the air is going to be warmer than the outside air because the heat get trapped inside the car,3
136500.0,i chose this answer because the sun is beating down on the car which is creating a warmer temperature then the outside air,2
154210.0,it will be warmer than the outside air because the car has been in the sun the car has also not been driven for a week so for a week the car has been in the sun baking,2
136374.0,because some heat has been absorbed and hasn t been let out,3
118593.0,i think it is warmer than the air outside because its a cold day and he hasn t drove it in one week but he parked it in the sun so it might be a little warmer than the air outside,2
136506.0,well metal conducts heat because it is a conductor so it is reasonable that the car would be warmer than the air around it,2
149965.0,the car is is taking air from outside the to inside the car,2
153860.0,the car has been under the sun for a week so it will be warmer than outside,2
153978.0,whenever a car hasn t been driven for a long time it gets really cold for example in the morning when i first get in the car that hasn t been driven all night it s freezing,2
118486.0,i picked that because the sun was shining on it so it must hotter than outside and its was under the sun for a week also it was colder outside than inside of the car,2
118474.0,the outside air will be the same exact temperature as the inside of the car because there are openings inside the car and that will let the cold air hot air come threw and that s how the temperature will stay the same,2
118446.0,i believe that the air in the car will be colder than the outside air because even though it was parked in the sun for weeks the sun changes position so at night the car will be cold if last night was cold and today is cold that s twice as much time the car has to spend being cold therefore the car air is colder than the air outside,2
139840.0,because it has just been sitting there just because the sun out it won t make it warmer so lets say the windows frost up so when the windows frost up that causes the cold air to get through and make it the same temperature as outside,2
150133.0,i chose the second answer because if he parked it under the sun and it has not been driven fro a long time the car s inside temperature will be warmer,2
118510.0,it captures the heat from the outside in when he closes the door the heat from the outside will beat on the metal of the car and heat it up,2
154132.0,body heat is preserved in the car space,2
118465.0,the car is closed off from the outside world so the air would naturally be warmer in the car although not too much warmer,2
151226.0,the car is warm a bit in the car because car doors are shut in the car and only a little bit of cold air goes inside,2
154042.0,because if you go inside the car you can feel the cold air is the same of outside,2
150122.0,i think it will be warmer than the outside air because even though it s a cold day its parked in the sun and as we all know when a car is parked in the sun is can get much warmer inside,2
154342.0,it would be that way because it is a cold day and the car has not been driven in week,2
118409.0,it is going to be warmer because the sun was heating the car,2
151193.0,it is cold outside,2
154149.0,it s because it collects the cold air from the outside and contains it inside,2
154127.0,it will be colder because the air in the car was never exposed to the sun unlike the air outside of the car the air was concealed in the car and kept cold,2
118441.0,if the car has not been driven for a week it would be really cold but it was parked in the sun also its a cold day so the inside of the car is a lot colder then the outside,2
153926.0,the sun comes in but since the outside air is cold the cold air cant get in and the cold air makes the outside cold but the inside is warm,2
150162.0,i think the car is slightly warmer because it doesnt really give me any detail about the car like it doesnt say if his mom had the car running or if the car was off so i am gonna say for my awnser if the car is on then yes it is warmer in the car but if the car is off then no its exactly the same temperature in the car as it is outside,2
150132.0,since the car has been sitting out in the sun for a week i think that the car is warmer no cold air can get into the car since it s closed up therefore the insides of the car are warmer than the outside air,3
118456.0,the air is warmer inside than outside because the air outside can t get in the car and the people breathe in the car and it causes heat,2
154345.0,its hotter because the heat from outside of the car go s in and it makes it hotter the air is stuck and the heat from outside makes it inside the car which makes the air hotter,2
149957.0,i think this because it was parked in the sun for a week and this day was probably the only cold day,2
150054.0,since in is a cold day and his car is parked in the sun i would say the car would be the same as the outside air because the sun makes the car heat up while it is cold,2
118452.0,i think this because the car has been sitting in the hot sun for a week,2
136414.0,i think that it wold be warmer than the outside air because it had been counselled,2
154353.0,it is that because u left it in the sun,2
136558.0,it really depends on the temperature outside because if it hot outside it will be warm inside and if its cold it will be cold inside,2
118576.0,i think that because he can heat the car up,2
150144.0,cars build up heat from the sun,2
153859.0,it is warmer than the outside air because it was wating i,2
154156.0,the car is at the sun and the sun gives the heat,2
149588.0,warmer than the outside air because only heat travels into the car when it had been cold heat can travel cold can t,3
150078.0,if it has been in the sun for a week it will become hot,2
136388.0,i am answering this question based off experience on a cold morning my mom and i went to the car that had not been driven in a few days and it was freezing,2
118598.0,it would be warmer than the outside air because it still has some heat left from the sun,2
150122.0,since it is parked in the sun it has kept the warmth from it inside the car despite the cold air outside and being parked there for a week,3
118300.0,because the windows are down and the temperature is really hot inside the car,2
136414.0,i think that because you have a ac to make the car colder and a heater to make the car warm,2
150074.0,i think this because if it is a cold day and the sun is still shining then the air inside the car should be the same as the outside air,2
118562.0,well it depends on if its hot or cold so if its hot the inside of the car will be hoter than the outside so scence it is traped so imagen how hot it will be in the car but if it was cold the car would feel like it is colder than the outside of the car but its really not,2
149959.0,because the cold air would cold up the car inside,2
154317.0,its colder inside because it said that its been parked in the sun,2
136381.0,i think that akbar s car is the exactly same temperature as the outside air because the car hasn t been driven for a week the sun and the temperature outside doesn t affect the car s temperature and i know because when i go in my car on a cold day the car s seats are as cold as ice,2
151215.0,i think this because it is a cold day outside and the car hasn t been driven for a week so it is not heated up making it neither cold nor warm in the car,2
6971.0,when your out of the car and everything is closed the sun is reflecting in the car,2
118535.0,if the car was left outside for a week in a hot temperature and this one day was cold its more than likely that the car is going to be warmer than the cold air outside,2
149963.0,i chose that the car is warmer than the outside air because when a car sits in the sun for a long time it gets warmer than the outside air,2
151201.0,becuse every temperture is the same,2
139747.0,akbar s car acts as an insulator which contains cold and heat inside the car got absorb by the cold air from the outside of the car,2
151218.0,it s because since it is in the sun for a week then it s probably gonna be a little warm,2
118579.0,it is warmer than the outside air because it has been in the sun all day and that heats up the car,2
118312.0,i think it is warmer than the outside air because on some days we leave our car parked in the sun and than we go in the car and its warmer than the outside air,2
153992.0,cause that happens to my mom,2
150061.0,i chose warmer than the outside air because it is sitting in the sun,2
118412.0,the sun is warming the car up and the wind is only affecting the outside of the car,2
154344.0,i think the temperature would be the same as the outside air because the air out side is cold and it makes the inside of the car also cold,2
154112.0,it will be warmer because i have experienced this before,2
151217.0,the car has been in the sun for a week,2
149587.0,heat is the absence of cold so heat got into the car because hot things move towards cold things and cold things dont transfer anywhere so it wpuld have to be cold outside and warmer inside,2
136508.0,i chose warmer than the outside because at first when the was coming the car was the same temperature as the outside but the air was stuck in the car for weeks and the air did not move or change and the sun even in a cold day can change the temprature in the car,2
136364.0,the car hes been sitting in the sun for a week and the heat will be trapped inside the car,3
150116.0,the car would be out for a long time in the sun which would become hot,3
153864.0,it s warmer then the outside because outside the car there is wind and has probably changed weather several times where inside the car it doesn t release air so that it stays the same temperature until it gets hot and then in the car it gets warmer,2
136509.0,because you put the a c on in the car,2
136481.0,if the engine has not been turned on for a whole week the i predict that the car will be a little bit warmer than the temperature as the outside surroundings why i think this is because the engine usually heats up the front of the car and if akbar owner of the car felt cold he would of turned off the heater inside the car and it will have a different temperature for quite a while,2
118518.0,i think that the car will be colder than the air outside because the car will trap in the air that is outside and have the air in the car become colder than the air outside,2
118543.0,it is going to be colder because the coldness is going to go inside of the car and mix the cold air and the hot air together but then the heat is going to be gone because there is so much cold air that the car will turn cold,2
153844.0,if he has parked his car in the sun and left it there for a week then the inside of the car is going to be more warm than outside because the inside of the car is usually more warm and i has been left there for a long time in the sun so it should be more warm,2
154318.0,i think that it is warmer then outside because its been there for a week and its been in the sun for a week and that is why i think that it is warmer inside,2
139850.0,it would be colder because it would be colder outside to start with and nobody has entered in the car aswell making it cold as days pass,2
118632.0,i think it will be the same temperature inside like it is outside,2
118354.0,the weather out side is cold and he has left his car in the sun but because he left his car in the sun does not in will warm because he has not used it for a week so it has to be cold inside,2
118404.0,i said colder then the outside air,2
153981.0,i am guessing the car is going to be colder just because from past experiences i have gotten into a car in the sun on a cold morning before and it has been slightly colder than outside in this case akbar hasn t been in his car causing it to be colder because of the lack of body heat,2
139798.0,it is warmer inside the car than outside because the heat has been inside the car for a long time,2
151211.0,i pick that answer because if it was in the sun for a week then the sun would have reflect on the glass there for it would make it very hot over time,2
150090.0,because i ve had exeperience with this when you havnt drove your car in a while and its hot outside it will be more hot in the car thats why you should not keep dogs in the car on hot days,2
153982.0,when it is hot outside inside the car is way hotter i know this because on summer days my moms car is hot inside,2
150128.0,it is warmer because it is in the sun and has been in the sun for a week,2
118585.0,it will be cooler because its cold at night and it hasnt been used for a couple od days,2
153906.0,it matters on the day it happened because at night it is cold and in the morning it is cold so it would be cold,2
118298.0,its because the car is in the sun for a week and the sun is hitting the car for a long time that why i think it will be warmer than the air outside,2
150214.0,i think it going to be warmer because in a car it is always warmer,2
150198.0,the reason i think this is because the car itself has not been driven for a week and we dont know the weather from the day before that which could have been warmer also even if it was a cold day it was still parked in the sun which gives it more heat than what the temprature is outside,2
153848.0,i think it will be warmer because today is the only cold day the other days could have been hot days,2
118454.0,it has absorbed all this cold air so its really cold,2
139853.0,it s warmer because it attracts heat so heat will be trapped inside,2
118319.0,because the temperature can change because it might have been hot one day but it says it was cold so the temperature changed to the cold,2
150086.0,because she s in the car,2
154133.0,why it will be cold in the car because when he left the car in the coldness for a week the car gets colder by the day so when its thier for a week the car will be freezing the next time he goes in the car,2
154329.0,because if the sun is shining in the car and its cold outside it would maybe the exact weather,2
151218.0,it s because sometimes on days it can be very hot,2
136555.0,the heat came in through the window and the heat could not come out because the heat reflected from the window,3
118371.0,i think that the answer is going to be the air inside the air is warmer than outside because it has been sitting in the sun for a week,2
150160.0,it will be hotter because the more you leave something out in the sun the hotter it will get,3
154138.0,because the air stays in the car and it heats up,2
154314.0,the sun was keeping the inside of the car warm in the cold air while it has not been driven for a week,2
150062.0,i think that akbar s car is warmer than the outside air because it has been parked for a week in the hot sun,2
118516.0,the car is warmer than the air outside because if the car is in the sun then it will heat up the inside maybe because the seats are leather which makes it hot also i have been in car so in my car the steering wheel gets hot and also the buckle gets hot,2
154201.0,if it was a hot day and your car was parked outside the car sit would heat up and the hot air inside would be exactly the same heat as outside,2
154199.0,if a car is standing in the sun the car would get heated up inside,2
150900.0,it actually depends if the person has the windows up or down,2
118306.0,well my hipothisis is that the car is warmer than the outside air because it might have absorbed some of the hot air outside,2
154152.0,i know that it would be warmer because all the hot air is going inside for a week and none of the air is coming out and just some of the seats stay warm,3
150129.0,the sun is beating down on the car and making the inside of the car hotter,3
150910.0,because the sun shines on the car when it s hot outside,2
136451.0,most cars from the st century have insulators in the inside roof of the car,2
151225.0,because when you open the door the air comes in the car,2
118469.0,the car hasn t been driven or even had people in it for a week so the car must be cold,2
136551.0,yes because it has been out in the sun for a week and if you have leather seats it will be hot then you when you get in the car all the metal stuff will be hot,2
118583.0,because it would store up the coldness,2
151200.0,i can infer that it is cold in the car because it is a cold day,2
154310.0,its going to be warmer than the outside air because the sun makes the car moisturize,2
118473.0,its cold ount side and when drive a car u have to wait until its warm so its probely the car will be cold maybe there is wind out side maybe the window might be open,2
139819.0,it would normally be colder than the outside air but since its out in the sun it ll cancel the coldness out,2
118411.0,the sun heats up the car even on a cold day,2
136413.0,the car was in the sun longer than it was in the cold it has also not been used at all,2
118392.0,well if the car is black in the inside and the sun is out the color black would absorb the heat and stay warm until the sun is goes down,2
154197.0,the car would have been exactly the same because even though it was in the sun the cold would have also affected the inside and outside,2
136387.0,the car has been sitting outside for a week so the overall temperature will be about the same,2
151178.0,i would say that the car would be warmer than the air because even though it is cold it has been sitting out in the sun for a week heating it up,3
136388.0,i think the air inside the car is going to be warmer based on personal experience on a hot day my mom and i had to go somewhere and the day before we didn t even use the car in was sitting in the sun and it was really hot inside i had to leave my door open while i was waiting for my mom to hurry up,2
118349.0,i think it is the same as outside because usely when we our on a trip and we dont use are car for a while cause we use another on and its cold outside its usely the same temputer as the air outside,2
118313.0,if it is in the sun the heat goes directly towards it and keeps it warm,2
150245.0,i chose this answer because the cold air outside combines with the air inside which creates even colder air on the inside,2
154316.0,warmer because the car kept in the heat,2
150168.0,the reason why i chose the answer in the middle is because the car is parked in the sun,2
139511.0,a car contains metal which are good conductors of heat if you leave a car out in the sun for a very long time the air inside the car will be unbearable to be in and will be much hotter than the outside temperature because there is no room for the air to escape so the air molecules will keep bouncing around inside the car same for cold temperature on the outside the car will feel much more colder inside than the outside if it is snowing or something like that,2
154217.0,even if it is cold but on the sunny side it is cold in side but it is hot out side,2
118402.0,colder because it has been out there overnight,2
154212.0,i think this because if it is a cold day than the air in the car would most likely be warmer than the outside it also has been in the sun for a whole week,2
150083.0,i think it would be warmer than the outside because its gust sitting in the sun and it hasn t been driven for a week,2
118352.0,the car may be exactly the same as the air outside because the engine may be shut down the engine is a car s source of heat,2
118467.0,it may be the same as the outside because when its night the car can cool down and then the next day the car can get warmed up again,2
118367.0,because on a cold day akbar walks to his car and he was parked in the sun he haven t droven it for a week,2
153992.0,cause my moms car is the same temp in outside,2
150149.0,since the car has been parked in the sun for a whole week i think that it will be a little warmer than the outside air because the car is all locked up and nothing can get inside,3
150922.0,because it is in the sun which will make it warm while the outside is cold,2
150200.0,i chose warmer than the outside air because it was in the sun for seven days and not driven and it was only one cold night,2
151198.0,it s warmer because it s been out in the sun for a week so i would expect it to be hot,2
150235.0,the car was out for a week so it was out longer than the cold was,2
118472.0,i think it s the same temperature as outside because the car is in the sun but at the same time the weather is cold,2
118300.0,if all the windows are up then its going to be really warm,2
154129.0,i think the air temperature inside the car is warm because if it were in the sun the whole time for a week it would be warm it would also depend on the car color inside and out because if it were black then it would bring sun s beams of heat to the car if white or any other color it would bring as much heat as a black car but the cold air might make it cooler because he just opened the car door and the car s air would mix with the cold and become cooler than it did before hand,2
154143.0,becuase when you get in the seat is cold unless you put hot air but still it is the same,2
151195.0,because it been sitting in the burning sun for a week,2
118597.0,his car will be hot because it as parked in the sun for a hole week,2
118585.0,its warmer than out side because theres some wam air inside the car,2
136403.0,i think his car is colder than the outside air because it has been sitting in the sun for a week but it was cold a old day when akbar went to his car even though the sun is shining on it and it it hasn t been driven for a week it is still probably colder than the outside air,2
136397.0,i think that it will warmer because i have heard that cars are degrees hotter than outside,2
150178.0,i choose this answer because when its a cold day the inside of the car gets cold too,2
