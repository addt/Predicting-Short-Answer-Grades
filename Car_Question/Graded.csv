154109.0,i think the air in the car is warmer than outside because even though it is a cold day if you park a car in the sun usually heats the car up for example one day in fall my dad and i were going into a store so we found a parking spot right in the sun and when we came back out from the store the air in the car was almost degrees and it was only outside,2
149972.0,the cold air will start getting into the car and making it cooler until it matches the air temperature,2
150090.0,because it will goi in the car then the air is trapped in the car so then it gets colder than the air because it is trapped in a tight space,2
118403.0,it is colder then outside because akbar hasn t driven his car it in a week and during the nights it gets cold and all the air gets tapped in the car,2
118615.0,because when you leave it for week then the car gets really hot and burns when you touch and when you get in the inside of the car its probably getting hotter than the outside air,2
150917.0,i chose colder than the outside air because it gets really cold over night and it s been there for a week even though it in the sun it s a cold day,2
118319.0,because the temperature can change because it might have been hot one day but it says it was cold so the temperature changed to the cold,2
136551.0,it is the same because it has been in the sun all week but once in the cold it gets cold,2
150176.0,it only describes this day being cold therefore it must mean that it could still be warm inside,2
150124.0,it would be hotter because he hasn t ran the air conditioning in the car or done anything else with the car so it would be warmer o the inside than the outside air,2
154149.0,it s because it collects the cold air from the outside and contains it inside,2
150228.0,it has not been used on a cold weather outside,2
150173.0,it is going to be colder because warm air moves and cold air stays,2
118595.0,it will be warmer because if it hasn t been use and the windows are close the air in the car has been warmed up,2
153922.0,if you have not driven your car for a couple days and its winter its colder than the outside air and if it is summer and you have not driven your car for a couple of days its hotter than the outside air,2
118360.0,the air from outside will afect the air on the inside and the sun will keep the car from becoming colder than the outside air,1
136418.0,you could have the cooler on and that makes the car cooler than the outside air and if you have the heater on the car well be hotter than the outside air and if you have nothing on and you have the windows the car will be the same temperature as the air,2
136574.0,i think it would be colder because if the outside is cold and it hasn t be driven for days that mean that it has no reason to be hot,2
150059.0,it would be warmer inside because first of all it has been sitting in the sun second because it has not been drove for several days and when that happens it always gets really warm inside,2
150918.0,i chose this answer because the temperature could not be hot because it is a cold day it also cannot be cold because it is parked in the sun so it would be the exact temperature of the outside air,2
118339.0,i chose this because he parked his car a week ago but it is parked in the sun and just because one day was a cold day does not mean every day was a cold day,2
118524.0,i think the temperature in the inside the car would be warmer than the outside because the car has been sitting in the sun for days absorbing heat,2
154332.0,because is goingto be that same,2
150243.0,it is warmer inside the car because since he parked in the sun the cold air will not take over only the warm air,2
118482.0,i think that the car is warmer than the outside because when i get in my car when its cold its more hot inside my car,2
149963.0,i chose that the car would be colder than the outside air because the question said on a cold day,2
118446.0,it will be colder because even though its been parked in that spot for days the sun changes position the sky starts to get dark at around and gets lighter at that s hours of guaranteed cold air the other hours may very from cold to hot to kind of warm so more than likely the car will start out cold from that night and stay cold because it s a cold day,2
151208.0,it is in the sun so it is warmer,2
136355.0,i think inside of the car will be warmer because even if it s a cold day the car is parked in the sun for a week just like when it s cold your car is a little colder inside but when it s hot you car it a little hotter,2
150176.0,if the car was parked outside in the sun for a week and only this day is cold it must be hot inside,2
136375.0,because when ever i go into my car in the morning it is always colder then outside,2
118618.0,it will be the same as the outside temperature because even though it was in the sun the air surrounding it is cold,2
150238.0,i think it s warmer than the outside air because the car might have built up warmth in it or it could just be the heater,2
153978.0,whenever a car hasn t been driven for a long time it gets really cold for example in the morning when i first get in the car that hasn t been driven all night it s freezing,2
150117.0,i think it is colder in the inside because it is a cold day the sun is showing but the coldness that is surrounding the car will make it cold,2
150128.0,it is warmer because it is in the sun and has been in the sun for a week,2
139747.0,i think it would be the same because it has been a week already and it must have reached equilibrium temp already,2
151179.0,its warmer because the sun is shining on the car,2
118413.0,it is a little bit warmer because the sun is shining on it but yet again it is cold outside,2
151220.0,the car has been sitting in the sun and has not been driven in a week but the temperature is cold outside so that means that the temperature will be the same outside,2
118345.0,that is my answer because it has t bean opened so no colb air got in,2
154146.0,if it is cold outside in the morning but it is parked in the sun it doesn t really matter because the same thing happens to my dads truck and when it is hot it gets hot inside my dads truck,2
154127.0,it is colder because the sun heats the air outside the car while there is no sun in the car the car is sealed tight keeping all the air sealed tight inside and not letting any air slip out of it there is no heat source therefore keeping it cold,2
154193.0,if the the day is cold and it is parked in the sun the sun won t effect the car since the air is cold,2
136367.0,in the car its colder than the outside air because the air conditioner is when you bring in cool air in the car but outside is warm enough to use the air conditioner,2
150247.0,because the air would have gotten in to the car,2
154026.0,i think that it is warmer because the sun is getting soaked into the car to make it warm,2
150070.0,because the temperature will level out between the outside and the inside of the car,2
151230.0,i do not naswer,1
118511.0,i think this because if you park your car in the sun on a cold day the the car will be exsactly the same because cars in the morning are sometimes cold like mine,2
154220.0,it is warmer inside than outside air because you can change the tempeture from inside,2
154347.0,it should be warmer inside the car because the doors should not be open and you can turn on the air and put it in to warm and not cold and you won t be cold inside of the car,2
151205.0,the inside of the car is not exposed to the outside air so it is not as cold as the outside air,2
136485.0,because if it s cold and it s parked somewhere sunny it will basically be the same as the outside air why because when there s cold and warm it will contain like the same as the outside air also because it s a cold day and his car is parked somewhere sunny doesn t change anything except one thing,2
154205.0,the car was parked in the sunny spot and had heat and heated up quicker if he didn t drive the car,2
154148.0,because if the car has been there for a week it would have the air that is had last time plus the air could have gotten in anyway so it would have the outside air,2
154132.0,body heat is preserved in the car space,2
118311.0,the air is colder than the outside air because which ever kind of tempature stays the longest gets traped inside the car then the outside air gets warmer,2
149588.0,warmer because the cold is not going in the car and heat transfers into cold,2
150141.0,because when my dad parks his car in the sun its warmer than the outside air,2
118547.0,i think because the hotter the outside air reflects on the inside air the sun is reflecting,2
136520.0,because common sense,2
150910.0,because the sun shines on the car when it s hot outside,2
118608.0,the temperature will be exactly the same as the outside air for example when ever you park your car on a sunny spot it is always hot and same if you park it on a cooler spot,2
149967.0,the heat was going inside the car and keeping the heat in,3
154204.0,if the car is in the sun the car it is going to be warmer because it is in the sun instead of it being in the shade where it is warme,2
118542.0,i think that it will be colder because if the air is trapped in the car then the inside of the car will have to even the coldness to outside,2
118466.0,i think it is the same tempature because the warm or cold air can get in by small holes and cracks in the car,2
150205.0,i pick warmer because it hasn t been open and in the last week you didn t open it and it might have the temperature from last week that why i think it is the warmer than the outside air,2
150174.0,it says on a cold day and akbar parked his car in the sun and it has not been driven for a week,2
150219.0,i chose this answer based on the fact that heat is stronger than cold air and also based this on personal experience,2
136363.0,it s what s present not what happened prior to him walking to his car,2
136422.0,i think it is warmer than the outside air because if his car was parked in the sun for a week and its a cold day his car would be warmer then outside,2
150245.0,i chose colder than the outside air because when i get into the car on a cold morning i always feel colder than it is outside,2
154161.0,the reason that i picked the answer colder than the outside air because it happened before to my moms car and it was really colder than the outside air,2
139876.0,the temperature of the air inside the car is exactly the same than the outside air because the cold air will outside is absorbed by the car therefore the coldness stays inside,2
136394.0,akbar s car is warmer than the outside air because it heat is trapped inside and was building up,3
150129.0,i think that colder than the outside air is correct because even though there is sun shinning on the car it is still cold so the outside temperature is will change the temperature of the inside of the car,2
150231.0,i think this beacuse since he she parked it in the sun it would probely be a littel marmer inside,2
118542.0,i think this because if its warmer inside the inside of the car will try to be the same temperature as the outside,2
118518.0,i think that it will be colder than the outside air because when it s hot outside your car is generally hotter than the air around you so i think that it will be colder in your car than the air around you,2
136384.0,even if it was a cold day outside the sun was shining on the car heating it up,2
118309.0,because if its a cold day then it will be realy cold,2
139856.0,colder because it has not been used for a week a car usually needs to be warmed up when started,2
154228.0,because if you leave in the sun it will get warmer then the temperature of the air outside,2
150115.0,there is insulation in the car,2
154042.0,because if you go inside the car you can feel the cold air is the same of outside,2
154312.0,it would be exactly the same because the air could get in from under the car,2
118439.0,it is warmer because the heat from the sun penetrates and makes the car warm another reason is cold air does not penetrate glass and the sun does for example when you put a magnifying glass to wood and the sun is facing the wood it burns the wood because of the glass,2
154107.0,i think it s colder than the outside air because its been there for a week day and night also weather changes over night so that is why i think the car is colder that the out side air,2
150085.0,i chose this answer because the sun is warming up the air inside the car it doesn t matter whether the air outside is cold,3
139797.0,nan,1
154346.0,because the window are close and and the sun reflect on,2
154330.0,the car will be colder that the air outside because the car would have gotten colder over time so it will be colder than outside and since its cold outside the car will get cold and go through the car,2
118479.0,it is hotter because the sun is hitting the car,2
136571.0,becasue when you park your car in the sun the car gets really hot,2
150072.0,the car is the exact same air as the inside because if he did put on a reflecting sheet on the car then it would remain the same if he didn t than the car would remain much colder i m not sure how he will get it warmer but i m sure for how it will be colder and the exact when you stop the engine the engine releases a final blow of cold or hot air into your car so then if you get into the car afterwards it will remain the same on a hot day on a cold day it will be colder than usual,2
151214.0,i think its exactly as the outside because it might be leather and leather gets hot in the sun,2
154156.0,the car is at the sun and the sun gives the heat,2
118623.0,i think it will be warmer than the outside air because it has been in the sun,2
136395.0,heat goes to the colder object therefore the heat will travel to the car until the car and the outside air are the same temperature,2
151201.0,becuse every temperture is the same,2
118306.0,well my hipothisis is that the car is warmer than the outside air because it might have absorbed some of the hot air outside,2
153843.0,it is warmer because all of the heat from the sun got in the car and cannot get out,3
150166.0,i think this because since he or she hasn t been driven in a week then probraly it will be the same temparature,2
139782.0,it would be much warmer than the outside air because if you leave a car outside and the sun is pointing towards it the car would absorb the heat,2
149951.0,it will be cold because if it is cold on the outside it will be cold on the inside,2
136580.0,i think that the the car would be warmer i think this because the sun would still be out and would be absorbing or reflecting the car just because the day is cold doesn t mean the inside would be the same temperature,2
,nan,1
150092.0,a car would absorb heat from the out side and the cold would leave the car,2
136406.0,its been a cold week and sunny weak and it hasn t been driven for a week so the car would have the tempature as it did when he started the car a week ago,2
118480.0,it might be the same temperature as the outside air because the car hasnt been driven for a week and its been outside for a while,2
149953.0,i think this because the outside air can contain the car and make it cold,2
139510.0,the heat is trapped inside the car from sitting in the sunlight,3
154220.0,well if he left his car parked in the sun for a week it will be warmer inside than outside,2
118372.0,when it is cold my car is usually colder than it is outside,2
118354.0,the weather out side is cold and he has left his car in the sun but because he left his car in the sun does not in will warm because he has not used it for a week so it has to be cold inside,2
154162.0,it would be warmer in the car because the cold air cant get in the car so it would be warm,2
150916.0,because you are inside the car the car has warm inside it,2
118308.0,because it could be cold outside and you have the warm air conditioning on in your car which makes your car warmer than outside,2
150901.0,it says on a cold day then its parked in the sun that s then its not been driven for a week making it exactly the same as it is outside,2
118338.0,it s a cold day but it is also a sunny day the temperature of the air outside is what affects the the temperature in the car,2
139843.0,nan,1
139843.0,equilibrium makes both inside of the car and outside the same temperature even though one feels colder than the other,2
136392.0,since the cold air outside is bigger and surrounds all of the car then the car must be colder than the outside air,2
150104.0,if it is cold out side i think that the heat will leave the car and become cold as the air,2
139778.0,the car is placed outdoors causing the heat of the car and the air to mix causing the temperature to be the same,2
118516.0,the car is warmer than the air outside because if the car is in the sun then it will heat up the inside maybe because the seats are leather which makes it hot also i have been in car so in my car the steering wheel gets hot and also the buckle gets hot,2
139517.0,the heat from the sun is retained inside the car and is not let out for a week making the car warm inside,2
152218.0,the car temperature is not same as outside cause car has a door that does not allow the temperature outside be the same as outside and it too has ac,2
150071.0,if the car has not been driven for a week then the temperature would probably be warmer inside the car,2
139533.0,i think the car might retain the heat and be hotter than the outside temperature,2
154107.0,i think it is colder than the out side air because its been sitting there for the whole nights and the car was not on also the heater hasn t been on so the car is defiantly not warm so that s why i think the car is colder than the outside air,2
154316.0,i think this because since the car is metal it will heat up because of the sun also the probably has some sort of insulation to keep it warm,2
118620.0,it may be cold but its still hot from the sun,2
136502.0,i think so because i have experienced it in my dads car when the air outside is cold my dads caris colder because metal is a conductor,2
150921.0,the air in the car is the same because the inside of the car is still the car,2
136683.0,i went in to my sissters car yester day and she had not divein her car in a long time and it was not hot or cold so i am geseing from edspereants,2
139509.0,i think air inside the car will feel warmer than the outside air because when i enter a car that has been sitting outside for hours the air inside feels warmer than the air outside,2
154915.0,it would be hotter inside because it has not been driven in a week so the ac has not been on,2
118352.0,the car s source of heat is it s engine when the car is running so if the engine was turned off the car will either be colder then the air outside or exactly the same as the air outside,2
150218.0,i think that because the heat warms up in the car but the out side air stays the same,2
118302.0,i think that it will be warmer than the outside air because it says akbar walks to his car that is parked in the sun and has not been driven for a week it also says on a cold day but it never said how cold the weather was on the week that he didn t drive his car the sentance also states that the car was parked in the sun for a whole week so that might effect the temp of the inside of the car,2
150904.0,the car has been sitting in the sun so the sun would heat up,3
154314.0,the sun was keeping the inside of the car warm in the cold air while it has not been driven for a week,2
150244.0,when ever i get in a car it is always warmer on the inside than the outside,2
150087.0,i chose colder then the outside air because every time i get into my car and it is a cold day it is colder than the outside air,2
153935.0,i got warmer because it may have been a cold day when he parked his car but when you leave a car in a sunny spot for a whole week the car is probably going to have a very high temperature,2
139528.0,nan,1
153984.0,because by then the car would have collected enough heat that it should be warmer than outside,2
150080.0,how it says in the sun,2
150204.0,i think the answer will be warmer then the outside air because the sun is very hot and the car was left outside for a whole week and has not been driven,2
150214.0,i think it is going to be a little warmer then it was outside because car tened to be warmer,2
151180.0,i picked this answer because when i do not use my car and when i get on it it is colder then outside,2
118615.0,because if you leave it for a very long time it will get even hot,2
118315.0,over time the heat would have stayed in the car heating the car up over time so even though its still cold outside it will be warm in the car,2
153992.0,cause my moms car is the same temp in outside,2
139798.0,it is warmer inside the car than outside because the heat has been inside the car for a long time,2
154224.0,cold because he has not warmed up the car,2
153856.0,the reason i chose that answer because i had the question before and so i checked if it would be cold inside the car like the outside then it was exactly the same temp like the outside even if its a hot day it would be hot inside the car like the outside,2
150241.0,i think it it will be warmer because there might have been a warmer day and the car will get warmer when not used,2
151194.0,a car can trap all the warm air inside of car resulting in it becoming warmer,3
150076.0,i think the temperature will be colder than outside because the heat will escape the car leaving the cold air inside,2
118509.0,it was in the sun and was really hot but now its a cold day so the car cooled down,2
150194.0,i think that the cold air would act like a refrigerator and start to make the air in the car cold,2
139511.0,because the car is made out of metal and being exposed to the cold outside air which cause the car to be cold and so is the inside of the car,2
118610.0,probably warmer because the car has been out in the sun for a week without the ac,2
150119.0,i think the inside of car is colder than outside because the car has been sitting there and nobody has drove so nobody turned on its a c or heater so all the cold air gets into the car,2
118549.0,i think that the temp will be hot in side the car because it was parked right below the sun so the heat coming from the sun will effect the temp in the car,2
154155.0,its warmer than the outside air because scince its on a cold air but it has been sitting on a hot day the air inside the car its colder than it was in the sun but its not cold ass the air outside,2
150648.0,colder because if it a cold day the tempurature will be the same as the air outside,2
118391.0,the car hasn t been driven for a week so no heat has entered and on a cold day it can make the inside of a car very cold i learned from experience,2
118478.0,when it is hot outside in is sweltering in the car,2
150080.0,because the sun is burning the car,2
118612.0,the person in the car can turn the ac on cold,2
136402.0,all the hot air adds up in the car and it gets hotter,2
118467.0,it is the same as the outside air because where ever the car is the air can go threw the car if the window is open,2
150134.0,i picked colder than the outside air because the car will attract more coldness from the outside,2
150238.0,on cold days sometimes the car can get colder because maybe the temperature gets through a small little opening so the cold air can get in but can t come out then makes the car temperature cold,2
153919.0,i think that it would be the same because the air would have gotten into the car and because the engine has not been ran so the car s air wouldn t have risen and the sun would have only made the car hot but not the air,2
150246.0,the car would absorb the cold air and get colder,2
118558.0,it is warmer because the sun is really hot and his car was outside so it is warmer in akbar s car,2
151212.0,the inside of the car is warmer than the outside the air because the outside of the car would be protecting the inside of the car mostly from the cold air outside of the car,2
153860.0,if the air surrounding the car is cold the car will also be cold inside,2
118406.0,its warmer outside because the air outside is cold with the car being in the sun if the front window is being hit by the sun,2
154344.0,i think this because the car is parked in the sun and is there for a long time so it would be colder than the outside air,2
154217.0,even if it is cold but on the sunny side it is cold in side but it is hot out side,2
150163.0,i know this because i read something about leaving dogs in a car and it said that cars are always warmer inside then out,2
150122.0,i think it will be warmer than the outside air because even though it s a cold day its parked in the sun and as we all know when a car is parked in the sun is can get much warmer inside,2
150053.0,i picked exactly the same as the air out side because if it has been sitting in the sun for a week it would heat up than cool down at night then when morning comes it would heat up again,3
118581.0,i believe that it s warmer inside the car because its been in the sun but it s cold outside so since the sun is directly hitting the car it will be warmer than the air outside,2
136417.0,it is warmer because in the morning it cold sometimes so you put on the heater on and becomes warmer in side the car,2
118587.0,i think that it will be the same as the air outside because it is a cold day and he parked it in the sun so it must be in the same air outside and inside,2
139880.0,i think that is going to be warmer than the outside air because the car was parked in the sun for a week so the air got hot inside the car,3
149955.0,i chose colder than the outside because it was outside for a week and that is a long time,2
150178.0,if the car hasn t been driven for a week then its cold like the outside air,2
150648.0,warmer than the outside air is what i picked because the sun can shine through but since the car has not been opened or exposed to the cold the cold air can t get in,2
150228.0,the hot air has been stuck there for a long,2
136493.0,i think that it would be like this because the car is parked in the sun and the sun would heat it up,2
118300.0,because the windows are down and the temperature is really hot inside the car,2
141560.0,nan,1
153906.0,i think this because it doesn t matter about how hot it was it matters on how cold it was during the night and other days it was cold,2
118412.0,i know this because if it is cold outside and the sun is out who knows if it was hotter yesterday or cold yesterday so if it is cold today and it was warm yesterday it can be the exact tempurature,2
154162.0,it would be warmer then the out the outside air because the air from outside wouldn t get in the car,2
153988.0,i remember one day i was walking to my car and it was cold outside and when i got in it was colder than outside and i think the cold air builds up to make it coldere than before,2
150903.0,i think that because his car is probably metal and the metal gets colder,2
150157.0,the heat goes in the car and cant come out so it gets hotter is the car,3
151165.0,i pick the that because when the hot air outside is warmer and if you leave the car out for a long time the air that s inside gets warmer,2
136361.0,as the car sits in the drive way the sun will warm it up and store heat inside when it is a cold day,2
150157.0,in the car there is ac air conditioner and out side is hotter or colder,2
150119.0,the air from outside is the same as the air in the car because his car has been on for a week so all the cold air comes in from the outside,2
153856.0,in my opinion the temperature in the car will be the same exact as the outside air because the temperature outside air will cause the car inside for example if its a hot day then the car inside air will be hot inside,2
149586.0,i said this because when i go to school then my dad drives me to school it stills fill the same coldness but after a while it gets a little worm,2
139768.0,the heat builds up inside the car very quickly with how closed and dark car interiors are,2
150164.0,there would be more density pacted in the car that can t get out,2
153916.0,i think this because if it is cold then in the car it will be warmer because none of the cold air can get in if it is hot then it will be hotter in the car because the car is made of metal and metal can absorb heat,2
154320.0,it will be than the outside air because even though it is it is in the sun it has not been driven in weeks resulting in the engine to some what freeze or not run properly and because it is a cold morning it was most likely even colder the the night before which will most likely result in the week being of relatively cold weather most likely the car is not going to be significantly cold in the car it will still be colder to some degree,2
154353.0,it is that because u left it in the sun,2
150126.0,i choose this answer because since it has been in the sun for a week the air inside the car would be a little warmer if it s not too cold outside,2
153993.0,it should be warmer because the doors are sealled,2
139516.0,the temperature in the car would not have changed that fast to the cold air outside if it has not been used and just parked there,2
153918.0,well since the car is protected and threres a heater i would think its hotter,2
150235.0,the car was out for a week so it was out longer than the cold was,2
150915.0,because its a cold day and he has not driven in it in a week,2
118353.0,i think that it is warmer than the outside air because if the car was not used for a week and it is parked in the sun it is going to be hot in the car,2
154159.0,this happened to my mom s car,2
150132.0,it is warmer because it was originally hot in the car the air outside is cold it can t get in the car,2
153936.0,warmer because it parked in the sun,2
151177.0,i think that in the sun it heated up a little bit and in the cold air it just cooled it up a little so i think inside the car it would be warm,2
154215.0,because the air can not come inside of the car and also cause the windows aren t open,2
118528.0,i bet cold air has been getting in all morning the sun might warm it up a tiny bit but not to the the point where it is as warm or warmer than the outside air,2
118405.0,it might be warmer because the car was parked in the sun for a week and the warm air in side the car couldn t get out so it stayed in side,2
136563.0,the hot air will counter act the colder air,2
118353.0,because it has not bin used for a week and the weather outside is cold,2
118357.0,because it would ceap some heat in the car,2
154336.0,becuse it dosent matter the tempiture of the last days it matters of this day and it was hot so the car is hot if its in the sun if is not then its cold,2
118323.0,i belive the car will be colder than the air outside because the car was outside so that means all the cold air was hitting the the car is metal so it makes the car even colder,2
118479.0,its the same because the hot or cold air gets in the car by the engine and it can make the car warm or hot depending if it is hot or cold,2
136399.0,if the sun was hitting the car for a week and just today she goes into her car the air is going to be hot but the car is going to be cold outside,2
118350.0,it is warmer because the heat from the sun has gotten into the car but the cold air hasn t,2
154334.0,it is colder then out side becouse it has been there for a week and how many days are cold it adds up,2
118483.0,this is because the sun shined through the glass which made the car very hot,2
153836.0,the car was hot because all the heat from the sun got in the car and cannot get out,3
136381.0,i think that akbar s car is the exactly same temperature as the outside air because the car hasn t been driven for a week the sun and the temperature outside doesn t affect the car s temperature and i know because when i go in my car on a cold day the car s seats are as cold as ice,2
154317.0,its colder inside because it said that its been parked in the sun,2
152218.0,i would probably choose the second one because the temperature is not same everywhere its even because the door of the car is remain close so the temperature outside cannot be inside even though it is has some a c inside so i have this thought about the second point,2
136477.0,it will be warmer than the outside because it has been in the same spot for weeks,2
154311.0,the windows in the car is reflecting the heat so when the heat gets inside it is warm,2
139847.0,nan,1
139871.0,the heat from the sun it contract the heat to inside the car,2
136396.0,i picked this answer because when its cold out side its gonna change the temp in the car,2
118582.0,because theirs no where the car can go so the air gets warmer and warmer and warmer,2
153996.0,i think it is colder then outside because whenever my mom doesn t use her car for a very long time it colder than outside but she does close the window,2
136356.0,i think that it would be colder than the outside air because it is cold right at that moment also the hot air affected the temperature inside the car and it got hotter it is like how the cold air affected the temperature how it got colder so i think that the cars air on the inside is colder than the outside air,2
150137.0,i said this because if the car has been directly sitting in the sun for a week and has not been driven it will begin and it will heat up,3
118597.0,his car will be hot because it as parked in the sun for a hole week,2
150117.0,i picked colder than the outside air because it was a cold day if it has not been driven for a week then it would be cold just because it was parked in the sun doesnt mean that it will be warm in the night it could be cold in the morning it could still be cold with the sun barley peeking out,2
150120.0,i think it will be warmer because i have a leather car and it is hot when i go in,2
