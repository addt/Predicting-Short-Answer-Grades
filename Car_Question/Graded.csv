150119.0,i think the inside of car is colder than outside because the car has been sitting there and nobody has drove so nobody turned on its a c or heater so all the cold air gets into the car,2
150206.0,i think it is warmer because when it is cold the car would be warm this morning i went in the car and it was freezing outside and warm inside,2
154204.0,if the car is in the sun the car it is going to be warmer because it is in the sun instead of it being in the shade where it is warme,2
118637.0,because it was not driven for a week,2
139855.0,the temperature of the air inside the car will be exactly the same as the outside air because our body doesn t feel temperature we feel it when heat enters or leaves the body,2
153844.0,if he has parked his car in the sun and left it there for a week then the inside of the car is going to be more warm than outside because the inside of the car is usually more warm and i has been left there for a long time in the sun so it should be more warm,2
139815.0,because the glass and body of the car insulates some heat,2
136425.0,the inside of the car is going to be exactly the same as the outside air because when i go into the car in the morning and it s cold outside it s cold inside the car too then we have to make the car warmer it s been in the sun for a week but it hasn t been turned on for me that s just a day so if it was in the sun for a week it s going to be cold,2
118563.0,it depends on the weather of the whole week and the weather of today,2
118357.0,because it would ceap some heat in the car,2
154159.0,this happened to my mom s car,2
150231.0,i think this beacuse since he she parked it in the sun it would probely be a littel marmer inside,2
136501.0,i think this because although it is a cold day all of the heat that has been in the car the whole week will have been kept in the car so it will be warmer than the outside air,3
154026.0,i think that it is warmer because the sun is getting soaked into the car to make it warm,2
151215.0,i think this because it is a cold day outside and the car hasn t been driven for a week so it is not heated up making it neither cold nor warm in the car,2
118471.0,the sun is heating up the air inside the car but there is no cold air to cool down the hot air so it only gets hotter,2
150228.0,it has not been used on a cold weather outside,2
118602.0,i think it will be warmer in the car then it is outside because the car has been sitting outside in the sun for a week and all the air has been traped inside of the car and when all that air has been traped in the car and the car has been sitting outside all of the air in the car starts to heat up,2
150054.0,since in is a cold day and his car is parked in the sun i would say the car would be the same as the outside air because the sun makes the car heat up while it is cold,2
150219.0,i chose this answer based on the fact that heat is stronger than cold air and also based this on personal experience,2
118543.0,it is going to be colder because the coldness is going to go inside of the car and mix the cold air and the hot air together but then the heat is going to be gone because there is so much cold air that the car will turn cold,2
136362.0,the air particles can not spread around they are locked in the car and do not move around which will be warmer if they are locked in the sun went into the car and stayed in there,3
141563.0,the sun is hot so its burning the car and inside,2
118354.0,because the car was in the sun so it wont be as cold as outside so it will be a little warmer then outside,2
154215.0,because the air can not come inside of the car and also cause the windows aren t open,2
118559.0,jonathan hernandez ghyuhyuiuhi,1
118561.0,the day is cold and if the car is parked outside it means the inside of the car will colder,2
118439.0,it is warmer because the heat from the sun penetrates and makes the car warm another reason is cold air does not penetrate glass and the sun does for example when you put a magnifying glass to wood and the sun is facing the wood it burns the wood because of the glass,2
118464.0,its going to be cold because,2
151228.0,if is cold outside it has to be warm inside because you re going to be cold inside and that s why it has to be warm inside because maybe you could get sick because it s cold inside,2
139875.0,the heat isn t going to be sealed in the car once you get in so after the cold day all the heat is going to be gone even if it sat under the sun for a whole week heat is released and not kept,2
149972.0,the cold air will start getting into the car and making it cooler until it matches the air temperature,2
150172.0,if it was parked in the sun for weeks then its gonna be warmer,2
118458.0,the heat is still traped in the car but the oxegen died out,2
118348.0,i think it is warmer than the outside air because it takes in the warm air form the sun and does not let the warm air get out and does not let the cold air get in,2
118345.0,this is the find because the car is not running so the cold air gathers on the inside this is because if you open the door the cold air will get inside and it will make the air colder,2
139814.0,the temperature of the air inside the car is warmer than the outside air because car has been outside in the sun receiving heat,2
139490.0,heat that has been reflected and refracted upon the car has been conserved in the car cars are made with metals so they tend to retain to heat a lot more even if akbar were to open it on a cold day the inside would still be warmer than the outside,2
139795.0,nan,1
118549.0,i think that it will be hot because if you leave a door open the hot air will stay inside and if there is nothing open then the cold air will not get inside,2
150920.0,it will be warmer,2
154317.0,i think its exactly because if you have your window down then the air from outside comes in the car,2
154198.0,i think that if it has been in the sun for a week and drives it on a cold day the car will be still be getting colder,2
118538.0,every time i go in my mom s car it a lot hotter in the inside then the outside on a hot day,2
139880.0,i think that is going to be warmer than the outside air because the car was parked in the sun for a week so the air got hot inside the car,3
118472.0,i think it s the same temperature as outside because the car is in the sun but at the same time the weather is cold,2
150178.0,i choose this answer because when its a cold day the inside of the car gets cold too,2
150052.0,i think that because how could the air inside be even hotter than the air outside,2
150089.0,i think it will be warmer in the car because the warmer air from the other day sits in the car and stays so the cold air from the outside will only make a difference on the outside of the car not the inside,2
139541.0,the car has been parked in the sun which warms up the car air is an insulator so heat is slowly removed from the car thus the temperature of the air inside of the car is warmer than that of the outside air,2
118568.0,como acentroid hai aide atrapado poco a poco se emfria,2
150135.0,the car is warmer because the heat inside the car is hot because the heat is traped inside the car while the air outside is cold,3
150063.0,the car will trap heat from the sun,3
118440.0,it depends on the weather if it is cold outside then it will be really cold inside the car because when it is cold outside the coldness will go inside the car and stay in there and it might also fog up the mirrors if it is hot outside the heat will also heat the car on the outside making the heat go in the inside and heats it up and makes it warmer inside then it is outsiede,2
136395.0,since heat always travels to the colder object heat will transfer to the car until the car and the outside air are the same temperature,2
118312.0,i think it is warmer than the outside air because on some days we leave our car parked in the sun and than we go in the car and its warmer than the outside air,2
118468.0,i think it would be warmer because the car kept the heat inside of the air making it so the air inside of the car would be hotter than the outside hear where as if a door was open the air would be the same temperature as the outside air,2
153860.0,the car has been under the sun for a week so it will be warmer than outside,2
150238.0,on cold days sometimes the car can get colder because maybe the temperature gets through a small little opening so the cold air can get in but can t come out then makes the car temperature cold,2
150118.0,the window let the radiotain in but not out,4
153933.0,one day my dad left his car out in the cold in san francisco and when we went into the car it was colder than the outside air i think that it would also be colder because it is a closed area of space that has no heat and it would just keep getting colder and colder,2
118300.0,because the windows are down and the temperature is really hot inside the car,2
136412.0,warmer beceause even if the car is white over a week it will most likely be warmer than the air outside,2
139838.0,the air inside the car would be warmer because the sun is directly pointing at the car making the car warmer on the inside compared to the weather outside,2
136685.0,the car is made of metal and metal is a conductor and a conductor produces heat,2
136403.0,even though it is cold outside it has been sitting in the sun for a week with the sun reflecting on it it will make the car hotter with it just sitting,2
136374.0,i think it will be the same because there is no sun to beam on the car,2
153926.0,it will be warmer inside because even though its a cold day and its cold outside the sun is shining on the car and makes it warmer,2
118512.0,a car on a cold day is usually warmer than outside because the car is airtight so the cold air can t get in the car which is room temperature,2
136417.0,i think it will be exactly the same because it can get inside by the heat ace vent and be the same as the outside air,2
150057.0,the engine was off so it was probably cold,2
118624.0,i chose this answer because if the day is cold nothing changes the car still is parked in the sun and maybe the sun has been up for the whole week so the sun s heat is focused on the car,2
118469.0,the car hasn t been used for so long that the engine is cold making the car cold,2
150516.0,i think it is the exact same temperature as the outside air because the air from the outside is going inside the car,2
154143.0,if the air outside warm or cold the tempature of the car changes because of the moisture or heat,2
136500.0,i think it would be colder because it is cold outside and the outside air determines the temperature,2
139501.0,nan,1
136363.0,because the heat would be in the car and the cold air would only affect the outside of the car,2
150113.0,if his car was in the sun for a week he did not drive it for a week the car can be hot because in side of a car has a miterle that is black it would be ever hot if he had a thing that was simmer to tinfoil the thing that simmer to tinfoil the sun rese can refleckt back to the sun the car would be cold but it did not say that something that was simmer to tinfoil that was in the car for a week the car would be warm that s my prouth that the car is ever hot payton williams,3
154147.0,i chose this answer because if the car is insulated in the inside the it would be harder for he cold air it get into the car and since the car is parked on under the sun it gets warmer,2
118443.0,the car would be colder than the outside air because the car hasn t been driven in a week and its cold outside the heat inside the car would have been turned into cold air because of the cold air outside,2
118626.0,i think that because the sun is only hitting the outside not the inside and it is cold outside so that means that it is same inside,2
150247.0,because the air would have gotten in to the car,2
150069.0,the inside of the car will be warmer than outside because he parked it the sun i know this because whenever i get into my dads car and its cold out the car always feels warmer than outside,2
118558.0,it is going to be hotter than outside because it has been in the sun for a whole week,2
118417.0,because if u turn on the heater the air will heat down,2
118352.0,the car s source of heat is it s engine when the car is running so if the engine was turned off the car will either be colder then the air outside or exactly the same as the air outside,2
154322.0,i chose warmer than the outside air because if it is cold outside but he is parked in the sun the car is going to get heat from the sun and it is ging to get into the car but the outside air is still cold which makes in warmer in the car,2
140093.0,because all that air that has been trapped in the car has not been exposed to the cold air so when you open your car it should feel warmer because it s been in the sun and not messed with for awhile,3
151189.0,it s colder because it is just in the outside not in the inside,2
139879.0,nan,1
149954.0,i think it s warmer than outside because the sun has been hitting the car for the last week and there s cold air witch it makes the tempature more warmer than cold air because of the sun,2
150085.0,i believe this because the sun is heating up the air inside the cool air around it is being heated up causing no temperature on the inside making the air inside get warmer,3
139831.0,the temperature is warming inside the car than the outside of the car because the heat is trapped inside,3
118406.0,its warmer outside because the air outside is cold with the car being in the sun if the front window is being hit by the sun,2
154200.0,it will be cold cause air gets in the car but not out so the air is just storaged in the car,2
150083.0,it s warmer than the outside air because the sun is shining on it and it tends to get hot and i have felt it before,3
136563.0,it would of traped in the hot air from the sunny weather before it was cold,3
118466.0,there are small cracks inside the car like the doors and windows so the air can get in,2
118344.0,it would be warmer because it is in the sun and it heats up the car,1
118438.0,i think it will be warmer inside of the car than the temperature outside because in the car it will just be normal room temperature and if its cold outside it has to be warmer in the car,2
150248.0,i picked this because this happened to me in life,2
118461.0,i think it is warmer because it has been parked in the sun for a week and the heat is trapped inside like a solar oven,3
154128.0,i think it will be hotter because it is sealed and it is in the sun so the cold air can t mix with the hot air in the car,2
151208.0,the car is colder than the air out side because the engine hasn t been on for a week so the car would be cold,2
118306.0,i think that the car will be colder than the outside air,2
149956.0,the sun gets hot but it is still cold outside so it has to be warmer,2
151176.0,he left his car there for a week so the temperature got colder outside and the temperature inside the car stayed the same,2
136549.0,the car is warmer because the interior is black or gray so it absorbs all of the color and makes the car warmer,3
149957.0,i think this because it was parked in the sun for a week and this day was probably the only cold day,2
118402.0,it would be warmer because the sun has been hovering over the car for a week and the air would not effect the car because the sun is stronger then the air so it would be warmer,2
136566.0,the heat of the car is hotter than the outside air because the heat is trapped it is trapped because of the type of metal the ca is,2
149961.0,if you park your car in the sun the car will become the outside air because it cant get warmer than the out side without it being on,2
154109.0,i think the air in the car is warmer than outside because even though it is a cold day if you park a car in the sun usually heats the car up for example one day in fall my dad and i were going into a store so we found a parking spot right in the sun and when we came back out from the store the air in the car was almost degrees and it was only outside,2
150138.0,because the sun makes the car hot,2
118302.0,i think that it will be warmer than the outside air because it says akbar walks to his car that is parked in the sun and has not been driven for a week it also says on a cold day but it never said how cold the weather was on the week that he didn t drive his car the sentance also states that the car was parked in the sun for a whole week so that might effect the temp of the inside of the car,2
153989.0,i think this because it s bend sitting in the sun for a week so it s abosrt a lot of heat,3
118613.0,its been in the sun for a week and they didnt say the other days were cold,2
150076.0,i think the temperature will be colder than outside because the heat will escape the car leaving the cold air inside,2
153928.0,it might be colder inside because it has not been driven an the motor is cold and not heated,2
118453.0,if the car was in the sun a long time it would probably have warmer air inside the car than outside,2
136480.0,because the car is outside in the hot sun with no windows rolled down and hand hasn t been opened up to get aired out so of course it s going to feel really hot,2
118477.0,i think it would be the same air as the air outside because first of all if its cold outside your car will become cold so you have to turn on your car and wait for like minutes for it can warm up so its basically like a human,2
139495.0,the car is an insulator where the convection inside the car keeps the car cool,2
118527.0,i think it is warmer then the outside air because the car was in the sun for a week without driving it,2
139797.0,nan,1
154216.0,if his car is parked in the sun the air is still cold the inside of hi car could be hot,2
139529.0,i think it will be warmer because it was being park in the sun,2
136363.0,it s what s present not what happened prior to him walking to his car,2
151216.0,i picked the last one because if it is hot outside and you park your car in the shade it will be the same weather as outside because the shade with just shade the outside of the car not the inside that is why i think the same thing will happen with if it was cold outside and you park your car in the sun,2
136454.0,it is warmer than outside because it has not been used and all that heat that was in there has no way to get out,3
136522.0,if the car has been sitting unused for a while then it will have accumulated heat from hot days and the sun how hot can depend on the color of the interior of the car,2
154371.0,i thought it becouse it is cool and if the heat comes then they become the same,2
150082.0,the car will be colder than outside because it will trap in all the cold air,2
118554.0,the sun heats up the car so the air is warmer,2
118473.0,because if its cold out side it must be cold in the car there might be a window open in the car slightly open or it might of absorbed the air in to the car,2
150245.0,i chose this answer because the cold air outside combines with the air inside which creates even colder air on the inside,2
154155.0,its going to bee warmer scince it has not been used in a week but the air inside it its starting to cool air,2
118339.0,i chose warmer because only a little bit of outside air can come into the car and just because today is a cold day doesn t mean the whole week was cold,2
153826.0,it has probably been cold out for about a week so it would be cold in the car,2
118613.0,the sun has been pooring down on the car all week so it will be very hot,2
153816.0,if assuming all doors and windows are closed the air is contained and if it is sunny will be heated as it is not affected by the cold air outside,3
118490.0,i think it will be warmer than outside because if the sun was facing it would get hot inside and the cold air is trapped outside,2
139539.0,it is warmer inside a car than the outside air because heat is being trapped in the inside the car but infrared light is not let out hot air and cold air is trapped inside in a process called convection cold air is going down and hot air is rising,4
118560.0,it will be warmer inside the car because the sun is shining inside the car,2
151191.0,it is in the sun,2
118620.0,its the same because it is cold not warm and if it is warm it gets hot,2
151220.0,it was a cold day but it was pretty sunny so it should be somewhere in the middle,2
154332.0,because is goingto be that same,2
151193.0,the car would be the same temperature in and out side your car,2
118585.0,its warmer than out side because theres some wam air inside the car,2
139823.0,the period of the car parked in the sun has been extensive extensive enough to have all the heat compounded into a enclosed space therefore all the warmth has been collected making it warmer than the outside air,2
150056.0,i think it would be colder because it has stored up all the cold air from the night and the day also when i get in a car on a cold day it is colder than it is outside that s why you have a heater,2
118484.0,i think this because every time i go in my car and it is cold out it is colder then it is outside,2
136356.0,i think that it would be warmer than the outside air because it has been parked outside more amount of days in the sun than in than it was in the cold it says that it was parked in the sun and hasn t been driven in a week than it says that he walked outside on a cold day assuming it was only one cold day and walked to his car,2
136483.0,i think it is going to be warmer than the outside air because not all of the cold air is going to go into the car that is why i think it will be warmer than the outside air,2
119017.0,if its a cold day than your car is going to have to be cold if it s surrounded by cold air,2
151195.0,because it is cold and if the car is parked in the sun it should be warm and warm cold normal,2
139846.0,the temperature of the air inside the car will be colder than the air outside because most of the heat is being transferred to the body of the car in addition the sun is hitting the outside of the car creating a thin barrier between the inside of the car and the outside,2
150123.0,if all the windows and doors are open then it will be the same as outside but if the everything is closed then it will be warmer,2
154136.0,it is going to warm inside in side the car but cold inside,2
153930.0,one time my family left our car outside like akbar did and when we got in it it was colder than the outside air,2
118459.0,it the exactly because ti reflect the tempeture from outside,2
136388.0,i think the air inside the car is going to be warmer based on personal experience on a hot day my mom and i had to go somewhere and the day before we didn t even use the car in was sitting in the sun and it was really hot inside i had to leave my door open while i was waiting for my mom to hurry up,2
150197.0,i chose this answer because the car may have not been driven in a week it has been out in the sun but that does not mean the inside is warmer,2
151190.0,it is a closed space so it will be warmer than outside,3
150176.0,if the car was parked outside in the sun for a week and only this day is cold it must be hot inside,2
154162.0,it would be warmer in the car because the cold air cant get in the car so it would be warm,2
153822.0,if its a cold day its most likely been a coldd week so therefor the car woul be colder,2
151162.0,its been outside for a week,2
150154.0,i think that it is colder than outside because that happened to me a lot of times when it was cold,2
118360.0,the air from outside will afect the air on the inside and the sun will keep the car from becoming colder than the outside air,1
149590.0,i think it will be warmer than the outside air because it has been parked for a week in front of the sun and the sun made the inside of the car hot and the outside of the car cold,2
150236.0,it would be warmer because if it has been sitting in the sun for weeks than it would get hot and also the air outside could of been hot the week before,2
153922.0,if you have not driven your car for a couple days and its winter its colder than the outside air and if it is summer and you have not driven your car for a couple of days its hotter than the outside air,2
151218.0,it s because sometimes on days it can be very hot,2
136408.0,whenever i enter my car on a cold day it is always colder i think it is colder because there is no heat reflecting and being absorbed through the window into the car,2
153981.0,i am guessing the car is going to be colder just because from past experiences i have gotten into a car in the sun on a cold morning before and it has been slightly colder than outside in this case akbar hasn t been in his car causing it to be colder because of the lack of body heat,2
118576.0,i think that because he can heat the car up,2
118396.0,it will be colder because since the air cant get out it can only change so since it was on a cold day it will be cold,2
136426.0,because if you haven t driven your car in a week and the air outside is cold then it is the same temperature,2
118456.0,the air is warmer inside than outside because the air outside can t get in the car and the people breathe in the car and it causes heat,2
154112.0,i think this because it has some body heat from when the person last left the car i also think this because my moms car gets warm when she does not drive it for a long time,2
150206.0,well on a cold day it was parked in the hot sun so it marjinal like hot and cold so warmer,2
118371.0,i think that the answer is the air will be warmer than the air outside because the car is in the sun and if the car is in the sun it will get hot,2
154193.0,the cold air could not go in the car because the car is closed and the eat from the sun goes in the car and thats how its warmer than outside,2
150650.0,i think the air would be coder than the outside air because it has never had a chance to get released,2
149966.0,akbar has not driven in a week and if it is a cold day most likely the other days were cold also since the car has been out during the cold days it must be freezing inside even if there is sun the air outside was cold so it made it freezing also,2
154042.0,because if you go inside the car you can feel the cold air is the same of outside,2
154312.0,it would be exactly the same because the air could get in from under the car,2
151198.0,it is warmer because the car was probably heated by the sun,3
154121.0,because when you go in a car its all heated up or its all ready warm,2
154331.0,i think it is warmer than the temperature outside because if it was not driven in a week then the temperature will have gone up and the car will be hotter than before because if it was parked in the sun it would have been hotter than when you drove it,2
136392.0,since the cold air outside is bigger and surrounds all of the car then the car must be colder than the outside air,2
118626.0,i think it is warmer than the outside air because the sun is reflecting the car and if it reflects the car it might obsorve or reflect but most likely to obsorve the heat,3
150063.0,i chose the second answer because if the car is parked in the sun it is in direct heat,2
118603.0,cause when you leave the car the temperature,2
118556.0,i think it is warmer than outside because the car might have been sitting outside in the sun for a long time,2
139523.0,i think the air inside the car is cooler because a car s outside parts are made of metal which transfer heat at a high rate therefore it will keep the inside of the car cool if the car is inside shade or a place that is cool but if it is hot outside and the car is outside then the temperature inside the car would be hotter,2
118419.0,the answer that i think it is because the sun warms than the outside air so hits the glass the heat makes the glass makes the food warm,2
118540.0,the air is cold because the air outside is cold even though the car is in the sun the air inside is still cold with that said the air inside is still cold even though the car is in the sun,2
151215.0,well the car is the same tempurature because it has been there for a week and i am assuming that because the day he got his car was a cold day the rest of the days were cold days so the tempurature is the same cold air,2
150115.0,the insulation in the car that s supposed to keep the car warm when it s cold makes it hotter,2
118609.0,since the car has air and it is hot outside the air inside the car heats up so that is how the air is warmer,3
139492.0,the material of the car traps heat from the sun,2
150079.0,because it s been really hot and the car has been driven in a week so it is propal hot on the inside,2
139509.0,i think air inside the car will feel warmer than the outside air because when i enter a car that has been sitting outside for hours the air inside feels warmer than the air outside,2
118548.0,i think it is exactly the same because its cold outside which makes it cold inside the car like in the morning when its cold the sun could be hitting the car but the outside air makes the car no be hot,2
139855.0,the temperature will be exactly the same as the outside air because they are at the same temperature there are no more heat transfers,2
151221.0,the car will get cold because their are littles spaces in the car then the air would get inside the car,2
150081.0,it s warmer inside because the cold air isn t going inside the car so ya the car is a house temperature,2
150918.0,i chose this answer because the car was parked out in the sun for a week and that would make the inside air of the car extremely hot it would be warmer than the outside air because the outside air has trees that could blow in the breeze or wind could appear occasionally but usually no windows or doors are open in the car to let in little bits of cold air the hot air stays cooped up in the car which is now very hot,3
154336.0,becuse it dosent matter the tempiture of the last days it matters of this day and it was hot so the car is hot if its in the sun if is not then its cold,2
118408.0,because any sun would heat it up,2
150097.0,i think that it is going to be hotter than outside air because the heat is trapped inside,3
118467.0,it may be the same as the outside because when its night the car can cool down and then the next day the car can get warmed up again,2
153910.0,i have experienced this before so i know if it s hot outside then it s most likely to be hot inside and the same thing happens with cold weather,2
118355.0,the heat that was already in the car is warmer than the outside and can not escape,2
136397.0,i think that it will warmer because i have heard that cars are degrees hotter than outside,2
153838.0,there exactly the same air because what ever the air outside reflect s in the car in the inside so that why i think their the exact same same air,2
118451.0,the car is in the sun so the car will warm up,2
150921.0,the air in the car is the same because the inside of the car is still the car,2
153984.0,because by then the car would have collected enough heat that it should be warmer than outside,2
154220.0,well if he left his car parked in the sun for a week it will be warmer inside than outside,2
154123.0,its colder inside because the cold air is covering the car so it we start to freeze inside and there less space so the cold air can travel around faster,2
136395.0,heat goes to the colder object therefore the heat will travel to the car until the car and the outside air are the same temperature,2
150922.0,because it is in the sun which will make it warm while the outside is cold,2
154159.0,this happens to my mom s care,2
154212.0,i would think it would warmer inside the car because it has been sitting in the sun for a whole week it also has not been driven in a whole week,2
153984.0,his car will be hot because since the car is made out of metal metal sucks in heat and makes his car warmer,2
154193.0,if the the day is cold and it is parked in the sun the sun won t effect the car since the air is cold,2
118446.0,it will be colder because even though its been parked in that spot for days the sun changes position the sky starts to get dark at around and gets lighter at that s hours of guaranteed cold air the other hours may very from cold to hot to kind of warm so more than likely the car will start out cold from that night and stay cold because it s a cold day,2
136569.0,inside the car it would be warmer from people body heat or heaters the cold air outside would make the car cooler until the car is the same temperature as the outside air,2
118318.0,the answer is that if it is iron it heats up really fast and it is very hot when it heats up and you touch it it is burning why because it is iron and the sun heats up the iron when it is very hot,2
154156.0,the car is at the sun and the sun gives the heat,2
154329.0,i think it would be colder because if it was parked for a week under the sun and its a cold day then it would be cooler inside the car because the air circulates outside the car and inside the car it stays cold because the air is like a freezer,2
136396.0,i mean it depends because when its hot outside and you want the ac on in the car then its cooler than the outside,2
153908.0,i think it would be a little warmer because it would trap air in the car and the little sun it would get will get it a little warm,3
150172.0,i think this because if a car is in the sun and wasnt driven for weeks then its gonna be warm,2
154115.0,i think this because the air inside usually is what the air is outside is but a little warmer or a little colder,2
149958.0,i chose this because the car has not been run so there was no ac but it was in the sun for a week and since the car is closed air can get in but not out,2
150056.0,it will be colder because inside the car it has stored up all the cold air so it would be colder,2
136494.0,i think the temperature inside the car is warmer than the outside air because the car will absorb the outside air the outside air is cold but the car is in the sun and the car has not been driven for a week so that means the car has been in the sun for a week instead of the car absorbing the cold air it will absorb heat from the sun,2
118524.0,i think the temperature in the inside the car would be warmer than the outside because the car has been sitting in the sun for days absorbing heat,2
154113.0,i think the air on the inside would be warm then the air on the inside then the outside because all of the heat would have stored up in the car and only a little bit of cold air would have been let into the car which would have made the inside of the car warmer then the outside of the car,2
154344.0,i think the temperature would be the same as the outside air because the air out side is cold and it makes the inside of the car also cold,2
150900.0,it actually depends if the person has the windows up or down,2
153919.0,i think that it would be the same because the air would have gotten into the car and because the engine has not been ran so the car s air wouldn t have risen and the sun would have only made the car hot but not the air,2
149970.0,it has collected enough heat to level the cold,2
150516.0,i think is warmer in the car then the outside because it has not been driven in a week and the sun has been shining on it,2
154147.0,the car is not the same temperature than the outside because it tracks more heat since it has more stuff inside if it,2
118301.0,the car will be warmer than the outside air because its been sitting in the sun for a long time also if there is some cool breeze outside when its very hot the car can t get the cool air because the car is closed and if the sun is directly hitting it the car will definitly be hotter than than the outside,2
150159.0,if you leave your car outside with no heating it will be colder then the outside temperature,2
118593.0,i think it is warmer than the air outside because its a cold day and he hasn t drove it in one week but he parked it in the sun so it might be a little warmer than the air outside,2
153928.0,well i used my logic to find out if its has not been run for a week the car its probably cold inside,2
150906.0,because the car would never be as cold as the outside unless the window was open,2
153915.0,because its been outside for a whole week,2
139817.0,the heat for the past week been hitting his car so the air that is inside is warm and the air outside is cold,2
136498.0,well the air will be warmer that the outside air because the heatwaves already in the car has been added with more hot air the temperature outside might have changed but the air inside doesn t change it only gets hotter because the air is enclosed form the car so any of the hot air can t get out,3
150231.0,becouse more heat is traped in the car,3
151165.0,i pick the that because when the hot air outside is warmer and if you leave the car out for a long time the air that s inside gets warmer,2
118577.0,nan,1
154514.0,i think its warmer than the outside because its a cold day but its sunny but the sun makes the car mostly hotter than the outside so i think its warmer than the outside,2
150141.0,because when my dad parks his car in the sun its warmer than the outside air,2
139787.0,it would be the same cause cold would remove the heat from the car,2
118315.0,over time the heat would have stayed in the car heating the car up over time so even though its still cold outside it will be warm in the car,2
154228.0,because if you leave in the sun it will get warmer then the temperature of the air outside,2
149959.0,because the car tempature will get hotter and colder because it is night time and night time is really cold,2
136389.0,i think that the temperature inside the car will be warmer there are a couple of reasons why i think this my first reason is that it was parked in th sun the sun probably heated up the car if the air outside is cold then the car would be warmer since it is in the sun,2
118391.0,when a car hasn t been driven for a week that means no heat from the car can get in on a cold day and it hasn t been driven for a week coldness will go onto the car and windows and the cold will be let in and it hasn t been driven for a week so the temperature would be even colder,2
118551.0,i think that it is colder in the car because when it stays outside for a while the cold air goes through the glass,2
153837.0,i think the car is colder than the outside because if it s a cold day and the car hasn t been driven for a week the engine would be at a freezing temperature and the only heat it would get would be the little amount of sunlight there is on a cold day,3
150910.0,because the air is very hot in a car and its because lots of people are dieing from staying in cars to long without air,2
150157.0,the heat goes in the car and cant come out so it gets hotter is the car,3
150131.0,if the car was under the sun for the whole past week the cold air and the sun should make the car almost the same temperature as outside,2
118409.0,it is hotter because of the sun and make the seat hot,2
118412.0,the sun is warming the car up and the wind is only affecting the outside of the car,2
151212.0,the inside of the car is warmer than the outside the air because the outside of the car would be protecting the inside of the car mostly from the cold air outside of the car,2
136389.0,i think that the temperature inside the car would be cooler then the outside air the car has not been driven for a week so the car s engine has not been able to heat the car up at all also it is cold outside so all of the air that goes into the car is cold making the car cooler,2
150127.0,it says that was parked in the sun for a week and hasn t been driven but it says he walked out to his car on a cold day,2
150218.0,if its a cold day than the temperature will change,2
136520.0,because the heat from the sun is absorbed,2
150101.0,it will be warmer than the outside air because it has been outside in the sun not driven for a week,2
136378.0,it is warmer in the car because the car is holding the warm air inside when outside the air is moving warm to cold,3
118398.0,i think it is waremer then outside air because i a car it is hotter then out side some times it is cold but i think my answer is right,2
118608.0,the temperature will be exactly the same as the outside air for example when ever you park your car on a sunny spot it is always hot and same if you park it on a cooler spot,2
153831.0,because the cold air and the heat will affect the temperature,2
151219.0,i think this because if the temperature is cold then it is the same in side that happens in my car,2
150062.0,i think that akbar s car is warmer than the outside air because it has been parked for a week in the hot sun,2
118451.0,it will be warmer because i ve been sitting in the sun for a week,2
136683.0,i went in to my sissters car yester day and she had not divein her car in a long time and it was not hot or cold so i am geseing from edspereants,2
136476.0,i chose colder than the outside air because i have had that happen to me,2
150919.0,because hot water gos up and,2
150176.0,it only describes this day being cold therefore it must mean that it could still be warm inside,2
154343.0,i think that that the car would get hotter than outside because its closed and well sealed,2
136551.0,it is the same because it has been in the sun all week but once in the cold it gets cold,2
139529.0,it will be warmer cause it was parking in the sun,2
118608.0,the temperature will be warmer than the air outside cause the paint that is on the car will be absorbed and it will have the heat in and so the inside air will be warmer,2
118606.0,it is colder because the air was trapped in the car all night and the car abosorbed the warmth so now all the warmth is gone and there is only cold,2
151214.0,it depends if its leather it is the same as outside,2
151230.0,i do not naswer,1
118367.0,because on a cold day akbar walks to his car and he was parked in the sun he haven t droven it for a week,2
153925.0,the black absorbs the heat so it gets hotter inside,3
154124.0,the air is trapped in the car for so long so the air is warmer,2
154302.0,i think that his car will be hotter than the temature outside because it has been sitting there for a week not an hour or somenthing and the tempature changes every hour on the hour,2
