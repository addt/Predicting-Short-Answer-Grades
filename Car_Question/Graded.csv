150132.0,since the car has been sitting out in the sun for a week i think that the car is warmer no cold air can get into the car since it s closed up therefore the insides of the car are warmer than the outside air,3
150118.0,the sun is still making it hot but the cold air is able to get inside,2
118455.0,the car contains the heat,3
136416.0,becuase his windshield is like a magnifind glass it heats up the car,2
153910.0,i have experienced this before so i know if it s hot outside then it s most likely to be hot inside and the same thing happens with cold weather,2
139737.0,colder because all the cold outside the car went inside the car and it trapped,2
136551.0,it is the same because it has been in the sun all week but once in the cold it gets cold,2
154302.0,i think it will be warmer because it has been sitting in the sun for a week there is no way his car could be the same temperature as the air outside in one day of the week but again it did not say how hot or cold it was that week it could have been raining but the sun was shinning at the same time,2
118621.0,because some of the outside air goes inside the car through the window,2
149961.0,if you park your car in the sun the car will become the outside air because it cant get warmer than the out side without it being on,2
136423.0,on cold days mycar is usuallycolder then the air outside,2
118296.0,even if it was in the sun it would still be colder in the car than outside because it was cold outside and the car was sitting there for a week,2
118473.0,its cold ount side and when drive a car u have to wait until its warm so its probely the car will be cold maybe there is wind out side maybe the window might be open,2
136463.0,it would be the same temperature because they are in the same place,2
154139.0,i think it is the same as outside because the air gets stuck in the car which makes it cold,2
154225.0,becuse it is cold out side and the car has a heter,2
150241.0,i think it it will be warmer because there might have been a warmer day and the car will get warmer when not used,2
154306.0,if it was to degrees and sunny as the highest the cold air would definitely affect the temperature to go down about degrees the sun however would bring the temperature up a little bit to make an exact temperature,2
150920.0,it is colder because there is air conditioner,2
154126.0,its warmer inside because the cold air can t get inside the car and the air inside is the same,2
150247.0,because the air would have gotten in to the car,2
118318.0,the answer is that if it is iron it heats up really fast and it is very hot when it heats up and you touch it it is burning why because it is iron and the sun heats up the iron when it is very hot,2
151211.0,i pick that answer because if it was in the sun for a week then the sun would have reflect on the glass there for it would make it very hot over time,2
136363.0,because the heat would be in the car and the cold air would only affect the outside of the car,2
154042.0,because if you go inside the car you can feel the cold air is the same of outside,2
139840.0,because it has just been sitting there just because the sun out it won t make it warmer so lets say the windows frost up so when the windows frost up that causes the cold air to get through and make it the same temperature as outside,2
153838.0,there exactly the same air because what ever the air outside reflect s in the car in the inside so that why i think their the exact same same air,2
154371.0,because it is like a spoon that has metal and metal burns in heat and the car is made out of metal so it will be really hot inside,2
136476.0,i chose a because the rest the outside air is going to be colder then the air outside,2
118469.0,the car hasn t been driven or even had people in it for a week so the car must be cold,2
139488.0,the air inside the car would probably be more compact and not as exposed to the air outside the car so it would be warmer,2
136557.0,outside of the car is cold so the the car would be cold even if the sun is shining on it greenhouse gases over rules albedo,2
150650.0,i think the air would be coder than the outside air because it has never had a chance to get released,2
118408.0,it would be hoter the out side because the air is traped inside the car and it is is just heating up in the car,2
136454.0,it is warmer than outside because it has not been used and all that heat that was in there has no way to get out,3
154336.0,its beacse a car gets more heated up beacuse its loke and no air gets and that air turns warmer witch gets the hot andthat makes the difference,2
118509.0,it was in the sun and was really hot but now its a cold day so the car cooled down,2
151230.0,i do not naswer,1
153985.0,i predict it will be warmer than the outside because it has been sitting in the sun for a week also it will be hot because he hasn t turned on the air conditioner in a week to cool the car down,2
154342.0,it would be that way because it is a cold day and the car has not been driven in week,2
118619.0,every thing is black in on the car and all the other days it was warmer,2
118579.0,it is warmer than the outside air because it has been in the sun all day and that heats up the car,2
151205.0,akbar car would be exactly the same as the outside air because the car starts out cold then the sun heats it up making it the same as the outside air,2
136375.0,because when ever i go into my car in the morning it is always colder then outside,2
139845.0,the air from outside is slowly transferring heat into the car,2
150900.0,it actually depends if the person has the windows up or down,2
136407.0,i think the car will have been heated by the sun all week,2
118457.0,if it is on a cold day it would be colder inside the car because the cold air gets trapped in the car,2
118482.0,because it has been parked in the sun for a week,2
153906.0,it matters on the day it happened because at night it is cold and in the morning it is cold so it would be cold,2
150903.0,i think that because his car is probably metal and the metal gets colder,2
154162.0,it would be warmer in the car because the cold air cant get in the car so it would be warm,2
118571.0,since the car has been in the cold for a day it is probably still cold,2
150120.0,i think it will be warmer because i have a leather car and it is hot when i go in,2
154123.0,its colder inside because the cold air is covering the car so it we start to freeze inside and there less space so the cold air can travel around faster,2
154310.0,its going to be colder than the outside because the air is in the car the air moculos will cool down and will be in the car stuck the seats will be cold the cars engine can get it colder,2
150131.0,if the car was under the sun for the whole past week the cold air and the sun should make the car almost the same temperature as outside,2
150122.0,since it is parked in the sun it has kept the warmth from it inside the car despite the cold air outside and being parked there for a week,3
153997.0,it will be colder on the outside because it is parked in the sun but it is cold,2
153924.0,because if its cold out side wear in the car it is hot that would be because there no open air,2
139808.0,the car will be warmer than the air outside because the is pretty much made from plastic and because its plastic it will transfer heat slower than metal will,2
118451.0,it will be warmer because i ve been sitting in the sun for a week,2
136363.0,it s what s present not what happened prior to him walking to his car,2
118339.0,i chose this because he parked his car a week ago but it is parked in the sun and just because one day was a cold day does not mean every day was a cold day,2
154207.0,i think its warmer than outside because the sun is hitting the car and when the sun hits the car it gets warm,2
136355.0,i think that akbar s car will be hotter than the temperature outside because when my mom s car is out in the sun for a long time it tends to be hotter inside also depending on the car s color it will absorb more heat,2
136556.0,i say warmer because it has been out during all those warm days and a single cold day will not immensely change that,2
154378.0,because in the car don t have ever window open,2
153854.0,the air from outside will travel through the car and the car will be the same tempeture,2
150156.0,when the ac turns on then air is cold,2
153928.0,it might be colder inside because it has not been driven an the motor is cold and not heated,2
150158.0,because when ever i am in the car its hot then when i get out,2
118344.0,the car will be hotter cause it absorbs the heat from the sun and makes the car hot,2
139815.0,the car retains some heat since it is enclosed,3
118466.0,i think it is the same tempature because the warm or cold air can get in by small holes and cracks in the car,2
118477.0,i think that the car inside will be hot temperature because when you havent used a car for a while and its been out in the sun the whole time the inside of your car will get hot,2
139875.0,the heat isn t going to be sealed in the car once you get in so after the cold day all the heat is going to be gone even if it sat under the sun for a whole week heat is released and not kept,2
154109.0,i think the air in the car is warmer than outside because even though it is a cold day if you park a car in the sun usually heats the car up for example one day in fall my dad and i were going into a store so we found a parking spot right in the sun and when we came back out from the store the air in the car was almost degrees and it was only outside,2
136403.0,i think his car is colder than the outside air because it has been sitting in the sun for a week but it was cold a old day when akbar went to his car even though the sun is shining on it and it it hasn t been driven for a week it is still probably colder than the outside air,2
118479.0,its the same because the hot or cold air gets in the car by the engine and it can make the car warm or hot depending if it is hot or cold,2
150904.0,the car would heat up or cool down compared to the temperature outside,2
118473.0,because if its cold out side it must be cold in the car there might be a window open in the car slightly open or it might of absorbed the air in to the car,2
153991.0,from experience the materials the car is made with held in the heat and the heat that came in causing the air inside the car to be hotter than the air around the car,2
118298.0,its because the car is in the sun for a week and the sun is hitting the car for a long time that why i think it will be warmer than the air outside,2
150194.0,i think that the cold air would act like a refrigerator and start to make the air in the car cold,2
118404.0,i said colder then the outside air,2
154149.0,it s because it collects the cold air from the outside and contains it inside,2
153924.0,it would be hot because if he left it for weeks it would be worm it was geting hit by the sun for week every day,2
118400.0,it will be hotter because nobody has been in it for a week,2
150242.0,the car is warmer than outside because it is not completely exposed to the outside air it is in an enclosed space the car will warm up when you start it,2
154347.0,it should be warmer inside the car because the doors should not be open and you can turn on the air and put it in to warm and not cold and you won t be cold inside of the car,2
118337.0,i chose my answer because on a normal temperature day the car would be warmer than the outside but the temperature was cooler than a normal day so the car was heated up by the sun but cooled down by the temperature of the air outside,1
139855.0,the temperature of the air inside the car will be exactly the same as the outside air because our body doesn t feel temperature we feel it when heat enters or leaves the body,2
118357.0,because it would ceap some heat in the car,2
136512.0,if has been sitting in the sun for over a week without touching it you would think that the sun would make the car hotter,2
118459.0,it is exactly the same because it not always hot and not always cold because it reflects the tempeture ourside,2
151179.0,i said colder than the outside air because if the car is sitting in the cold all day with a little sun for a week than it will become colder,2
154118.0,this is a form of conduction the cold is outside is transferred to the car this makes the car cold,2
150089.0,i think it is going to be warmer in the car then outside because when it once was warm and so the warm air in the car stays in there because warm air moves and cold air stays in place so when it is cold outside the air stays cold and the warm air in the car stays warm,2
118299.0,well it depends because some cars only use cold air some hot and some have no air conditioning and some have both but all in all it just depends what kind car you have,2
136381.0,i think that akbar s car is the exactly same temperature as the outside air because the car hasn t been driven for a week the sun and the temperature outside doesn t affect the car s temperature and i know because when i go in my car on a cold day the car s seats are as cold as ice,2
150154.0,i think that it is colder than outside because that happened to me a lot of times when it was cold,2
154323.0,i chose this because it depends if you run the air,2
150223.0,the air would be warmer in the car than the outside air because he left his car in the sun so the car was heating up when he wasn t using it,3
153834.0,even though there s sun heating the car the cold air cools it at the same time,2
153922.0,if you have not driven your car for a couple days and its winter its colder than the outside air and if it is summer and you have not driven your car for a couple of days its hotter than the outside air,2
139538.0,the cold air outside will gradually decrease the warm temperature that was inside the car eventually bringing it to equilibrium,2
150178.0,i choose this answer because when its a cold day the inside of the car gets cold too,2
154121.0,because when you go in a car its all heated up or its all ready warm,2
118537.0,i think that it would be colder because the temperature can warm up with the sun outside but inside there is not anything to make it warm up with,2
149960.0,if the car was in the sun then it would heat up the car,3
118542.0,i think that it will be colder because if the air is trapped in the car then the inside of the car will have to even the coldness to outside,2
118582.0,because the air in the car will get contained and get heated,3
118344.0,it would be warmer because it is in the sun and it heats up the car,1
151220.0,it was a cold day but it was pretty sunny so it should be somewhere in the middle,2
118354.0,because the car was in the sun so it wont be as cold as outside so it will be a little warmer then outside,2
139814.0,the temperature of the air inside the car is warmer than the outside air because car has been outside in the sun receiving heat,2
154137.0,i picked warmer than the outside air because when its very hot outside and the sun is hitting a car the inside of the car its very very hot i also could of picked exactly the same as the outside air because if the weather is very cold outside then the car is the same temperature as the outside,2
118622.0,i think it will be warmer than the outside of the car because not all of the days were cold probally cold and the car has not been opened yet,2
118459.0,it the exactly because ti reflect the tempeture from outside,2
154353.0,it would be colder because the cold air would be innsolated in the car,2
139819.0,it would normally be colder than the outside air but since its out in the sun it ll cancel the coldness out,2
139790.0,the sun is still giving heat but maybe the cold is coming from the breeze and the breeze does not go inside the car so then the car is still warmer than the outside air,2
136359.0,well if the car is black then the outside is going to be hot but if the inside is all black too then the inside would be hotter because there are more things to reflect off of,2
118297.0,because the sun has made the inside of the car warmer than the air outside of the car,2
150116.0,the temperature outside would give the car the same,2
118526.0,i picked this answer because if its cold outside but its parked in the sun then it would be hotter in the car then outside of the car,2
150237.0,because even tho it been hot for a week its cold now because of the weather now,2
150133.0,i chose the second answer because if he parked it under the sun and it has not been driven fro a long time the car s inside temperature will be warmer,2
118604.0,the air is cold but the car is under the sun so ithink that the tempretues would balance out,2
118346.0,the car is under the sun so the air in the car is getting warm,2
136483.0,i think it is going to be warmer than the outside air because not all of the cold air is going to go into the car that is why i think it will be warmer than the outside air,2
136477.0,it will be warmer than the outside air because it has not driven for a week and has not moved places at all,2
136558.0,it really depends on the temperature outside because if it hot outside it will be warm inside and if its cold it will be cold inside,2
150104.0,if it is cold out side i think that the heat will leave the car and become cold as the air,2
154210.0,it will be warmer than the outside air because the car has been in the sun the car has also not been driven for a week so for a week the car has been in the sun baking,2
154337.0,it was was very cold then it was in the sun for a week then if it was cold and it sat in the hot sun for a week it is should probably be warmer from all the hot temperature,2
139536.0,the air inside the car would be heated air from the sun compared to the cold air outside of the car the air the air inside would feel warmer due to being heated by the sun,2
150114.0,becuose to mack it warm in side,2
136465.0,it will be colder because he hasn t drove it in a while you would need to have the car on to make it warmer,2
136362.0,it would be colder than outside because there is no sun to heat it up inside like a oven the cold air goes in the car an does not escape it has not been on either so that means that the engine wont make the car warm the engine makes the car hotter but the sun from before was making it hot except now it is a cold day with no sun,2
154304.0,i think it would be colder inside the car because if you havent driven the car for a week then it would be what ever tempiture it is outside,2
154156.0,the car is at the sun and the sun gives the heat,2
118602.0,i think it will be colder because the car has not been driven for a week so how is the car suppost to stay warm,2
118404.0,if is hot outside then is hot inside the car and if is cold outside then inside is cold,2
150908.0,i think it is exactly the same air outside because the air inside the car is hot and the air outside the car is cold so when it mix its the same temperature,2
139869.0,since the car has been sitting outside for a week without driving it it d feel warmer than the outside,2
150205.0,i pick warmer because it hasn t been open and in the last week you didn t open it and it might have the temperature from last week that why i think it is the warmer than the outside air,2
153831.0,i think that it will be the same because the car is in the sun but it is a cold day,2
118556.0,i think it will be warmer because the car was parked in the sun for a week,2
118563.0,if you have not driven your car for a week then the heat will accustom to the outside s heat,2
149966.0,akbar has not driven in a week and if it is a cold day most likely the other days were cold also since the car has been out during the cold days it must be freezing inside even if there is sun the air outside was cold so it made it freezing also,2
150065.0,the car has probably not had it s heater ran in weeks so the car is probably very cold it might not be insulated so some extra cold air that hadent already cooled down probably escaped,2
150166.0,i think this because since he or she hasn t been driven in a week then probraly it will be the same temparature,2
118586.0,the car will be colder because you have kept the car outside for a week so the temperature will go up,2
154308.0,the air will be warmer because the air inside is confined and there outsidse is not the air is much more pressurized,2
150059.0,i predict that it would be warmer on the inside because since it has been sitting in the sun for a couple of days and it has not been drove either it has to be hot i also predict that because it has happened with my dad s car,2
136496.0,warmer because the heat from the sun is heating up the car,2
150062.0,i think that akbar s car is warmer than the outside air because his car has been parked outside in the hot sun for a week so his car has to be warmer inside than the outside air,2
151205.0,the inside of the car is not exposed to the outside air so it is not as cold as the outside air,2
150176.0,if the car was parked outside in the sun for a week and only this day is cold it must be hot inside,2
139824.0,i predict that the car will be the same temperature as the outside air because even though the car was parked in the sun for a week the air outside can affect how hot or cold the car would be since the air is cold outside the car s temperature will go down,2
153916.0,i think this because if it is cold then in the car it will be warmer because none of the cold air can get in if it is hot then it will be hotter in the car because the car is made of metal and metal can absorb heat,2
151231.0,inside a car is almost sealtight,2
149967.0,i chose this answer because its warmer outside,2
136420.0,it is warmer because yesterday mught have been a hot day so it is still holding in all the heat from the past week,2
150057.0,every time my parents park in the sun for a while it get s so hot and feels hotter than outside the sun heats it up,3
136381.0,i think it is exactly the same as the outside air because when i go inside my car on a cold day it is the same temperature as outside,2
154334.0,it is colder then out side becouse it has been there for a week and how many days are cold it adds up,2
153848.0,i think it will be warmer because today is the only cold day the other days could have been hot days,2
149964.0,the air is going to be warmer than the outside air because the heat get trapped inside the car,3
154113.0,i think the air on the inside would be warm then the air on the inside then the outside because all of the heat would have stored up in the car and only a little bit of cold air would have been let into the car which would have made the inside of the car warmer then the outside of the car,2
153977.0,if the doors have been shut then the temp should be the same because the temp does not transfer into the car one more thing is that if it was one cold day it would be warmer,2
139817.0,the heat for the past week been hitting his car so the air that is inside is warm and the air outside is cold,2
150083.0,it s warmer than the outside air because the sun is shining on it and it tends to get hot and i have felt it before,3
150648.0,colder because if it a cold day the tempurature will be the same as the air outside,2
136457.0,this is not the best explanation but yeah it s warmer in the car possibly since the car s exterior is made out of metal the heat from the sun probably is absorbed by the car s exterior and is stored into the interior of the car,2
154848.0,i think so because of the facts that wen you touch a hot car wen it is hot it can bern your hand and also the facts that if you sit inside the car it will bern but i personly beleve that it is not as hot is the thecar,2
153838.0,it s warmer than outside air because the temperature in the car as differnt air than the outside air,2
136520.0,because the heat from the sun is absorbed,2
151177.0,i think that in the sun it heated up a little bit and in the cold air it just cooled it up a little so i think inside the car it would be warm,2
150093.0,i think wamer because the car is outside in the sun and when my mom does that not even for mins it is supper hot already,2
150096.0,the answer is colder than than outside air because the wirter said on a co,2
118456.0,the air is warmer inside than outside because the air outside can t get in the car and the people breathe in the car and it causes heat,2
118516.0,i think it is warmer inside then outside because the car was parked in the sun,2
150199.0,maybe akbar drove his car on a hot day and maybe some of the hot air stayed in his car so when he gets into his car it will be warm,2
150177.0,it s because the car as not been running also because the the air on the outside is cold,2
150143.0,i think this because if the air out side is cold and the car has been outside in the sun and have not been driven the car will be hotter than the outside air,2
154145.0,it is going to be cold than the outside air because since it s cold the metal of the car passes the cold air in the car,2
154107.0,i think it s colder than the outside air because its been there for a week day and night also weather changes over night so that is why i think the car is colder that the out side air,2
150916.0,because the heat can get through the window and stay in there getting hotter,3
150144.0,the heat would warm the car up but it is a cold day so the cold outside would cool the car down,2
154313.0,because usually the heat on the outside would transfer to the inside of the car,2
152218.0,i would probably choose the second one because the temperature is not same everywhere its even because the door of the car is remain close so the temperature outside cannot be inside even though it is has some a c inside so i have this thought about the second point,2
136374.0,i think it will be the same because there is no sun to beam on the car,2
118527.0,i think it is warmer then the outside air because the car was in the sun for a week without driving it,2
118518.0,i think that it will be colder than the outside air because when it s hot outside your car is generally hotter than the air around you so i think that it will be colder in your car than the air around you,2
136413.0,the sun has been on the car so the car has absorbed the heat since it has not been driven for a week,2
151215.0,i think this because it is a cold day outside and the car hasn t been driven for a week so it is not heated up making it neither cold nor warm in the car,2
136398.0,i chose this answer because it s been parked in the sun all week and the glass windshield absorbed the heat in the atmosphere and that means it will be warm when you get in,2
149588.0,warmer because the cold is not going in the car and heat transfers into cold,2
118310.0,i think it would be warmer than inside because the sun is hitting the car directly so the heat is going to make inside the car hot,2
149968.0,i think it is going to be colder than the outside air because it has been there for a lot of weeks,2
150082.0,the car will be colder than outside because it will trap in all the cold air,2
154197.0,the car would have been exactly the same because even though it was in the sun the cold would have also affected the inside and outside,2
139490.0,heat that has been reflected and refracted upon the car has been conserved in the car cars are made with metals so they tend to retain to heat a lot more even if akbar were to open it on a cold day the inside would still be warmer than the outside,2
139515.0,the air inside the car is warmer than the outside air because the outside air is affected by convection currents which cools it,2
118533.0,it will be hotter in the car because the car is insulated by the fabric and foam,2
118542.0,i think this because if its warmer inside the inside of the car will try to be the same temperature as the outside,2
149586.0,i said this because when i go to school then my dad drives me to school it stills fill the same coldness but after a while it gets a little worm,2
118516.0,the car is warmer than the air outside because if the car is in the sun then it will heat up the inside maybe because the seats are leather which makes it hot also i have been in car so in my car the steering wheel gets hot and also the buckle gets hot,2
136546.0,the car is made out of multiple materials such as metal and metal heats up a lot on a hot day your car could potentially be an oven,2
149962.0,when you have not driven a car for a week it gets cold but if you do drive your car every day it will not get so cold as you leave a car outside it gets colder by the minute this means if you leave you car outside for a week it gets really cold and by hours it gets supper cold it will still get cold weather it is hot or cold outside,2
118511.0,i think this because if you park your car in the sun on a cold day the the car will be exsactly the same because cars in the morning are sometimes cold like mine,2
118557.0,i think that it will be exactly the same as the outside air because even though it the sun is shinning it is also a cold day so the tempurature balences out with each other,2
150919.0,coleder,1
118576.0,i think that because he can heat the car up,2
118548.0,i think it will be the same because the outside air is where the car is in the sun my be hitting it but the coldness will balence it our,2
118525.0,i think because it is out in the sun and the sun has warmed up the car for a week it is warmer than the outside air,2
139842.0,because of the glass of the car will increase the heat whenever it goes thru the glass,2
118529.0,it is warm because of the heat that was shined on the sun if it was longer in the sun it would have been more warmer,2
153989.0,because it s park in the sun and it hasn t been driven for a week all the hot air is still in the car so the car is warmer,2
150118.0,the window let the radiotain in but not out,4
150124.0,i would think the car would be warmer than outside because if its in the sun and hasnt been driven for weeks than its probably hot,2
154159.0,this happened to my mom s car,2
151162.0,because the car is parked in the sun so it warms up the car,2
154314.0,the sun was keeping the inside of the car warm in the cold air while it has not been driven for a week,2
154848.0,it will most likey be worm inside than outside becuse it has an motter and some left over body heat,2
136352.0,the car has not been driven and is parked on a cold day is warmer because it is parked in the sun and cars are made of metal making it a good conductor of heat that is why it would be warmer,2
118612.0,you can put the warm air in the car,2
154212.0,i think this because if it is a cold day than the air in the car would most likely be warmer than the outside it also has been in the sun for a whole week,2
118439.0,it is warmer because the heat from the sun penetrates and makes the car warm another reason is cold air does not penetrate glass and the sun does for example when you put a magnifying glass to wood and the sun is facing the wood it burns the wood because of the glass,2
118309.0,because if its a cold day then it will be realy cold,2
150114.0,it will mack the car wormer and you can drive it when irs worm,2
153909.0,it is the same air temp because the day is a cold day but the car has been parked in the sun for a week so the cold air cools the car slightly but its still a little warm from the days being parked in the sun,2
153856.0,in my opinion the temperature in the car will be the same exact as the outside air because the temperature outside air will cause the car inside for example if its a hot day then the car inside air will be hot inside,2
136377.0,i said exactly the same because when it is cold outside your car gets coolder and when it is hot your car gets warmer,2
139525.0,the temperature of the inside the car will be warmer than the outside air because the car s materials serve as an insulator for the heat inside the air inside the car,2
118460.0,well i chose this answer because well the sun hits the car but the sun is not that hot to the cold temp because it will just melt the snow or ice,2
150124.0,it would be hotter because he hasn t ran the air conditioning in the car or done anything else with the car so it would be warmer o the inside than the outside air,2
154220.0,well if he left his car parked in the sun for a week it will be warmer inside than outside,2
150244.0,when ever i get in a car it is always warmer on the inside than the outside,2
139494.0,it is colder because the environment inside the car keeps in the temperature and stores the coldness inside the car while the outside temperature slowly changes,2
149955.0,i chose because it has been there for one week and all the heat was inside,2
154123.0,because there less space in the car so the cold air can travel around faster and get the inside cold and the cold air gets trap inside,2
118595.0,it will be warmer because if it hasn t been use and the windows are close the air in the car has been warmed up,2
150170.0,i think it is warmer than the outside air because the sun could ve been shining on the car for a week and the heat from the sun is being transferred into the car also cold cannot move it stays in one place,3
118535.0,if the car was left outside for a week in a hot temperature and this one day was cold its more than likely that the car is going to be warmer than the cold air outside,2
150061.0,i picked the third one because the out temp is what heats the car,2
151193.0,it is cold outside,2
149970.0,the elements cancel each other out,2
136462.0,if the windows are not open and the sun was on the car for a whloe week it will be very hot,2
118339.0,i chose warmer because only a little bit of outside air can come into the car and just because today is a cold day doesn t mean the whole week was cold,2
150516.0,i think it is the exact same temperature as the outside air because the air from the outside is going inside the car,2
136516.0,i think it would be warmer then the outside air because all the air has been captured in the car for a week and it wouldn t be able to escape unless a window was open or a door was open,2
139849.0,the car is a smaller area that conducts more heat,2
139496.0,the inside of the car would be colder because it is a cold day the cold air is seeping into the car and the coldness is being trapped inside,2
154138.0,because the sun is always on the sun for week and it was cold so it might be warmer inside the car than outside also the car is made of metal so than it gets hot,2
118514.0,if akbar s car had been barked in the sun the car would absorb the heat and the heat would stay contained in the car because it does not have a passage out of the car,3
150221.0,the sun made the car hot,2
136372.0,in a car the air gets in through the windows and the air vents which makes it colder because it goes through the air conditioner vent,2
118486.0,i chose that because the car was parked in the sun which means the sun gave the car more heat than the outside also it wasn t driven for a week and it was under the sun for a week which means it must have been hot in the car,2
118293.0,well since the car holds the temperature of out side and so the temperature of the car would be the same temperature or colder as the outside air,2
118564.0,when you leave the car over nights and its cold and the morning its cold,2
150167.0,if a car is in the cold more hot air will push in whilst more cold air will come out and won t be able to go,2
136576.0,i think it would be colder because a car is not just sealed shut it has a way for air to get to the inside and i think if the air is colder than the air that goes into the car it will be cold since the air outside is cold,2
154132.0,body heat is preserved in the car space,2
136580.0,i think that the the car would be warmer i think this because the sun would still be out and would be absorbing or reflecting the car just because the day is cold doesn t mean the inside would be the same temperature,2
139864.0,the car will reach equilibrium temperature with the outside air,2
150158.0,because the hot air only can go in,2
118453.0,it is warmer in the inside because the car was closed and the outside is colder and doesnt get in the car,2
150053.0,i picked exactly the same as the air out side because if it has been sitting in the sun for a week it would heat up than cool down at night then when morning comes it would heat up again,3
150075.0,i chose this because the air transfers the heat to the outside of the car making the air inside colder,2
136499.0,i say that it is colder than the outside because the color of the car would reflect the sun keeping the inside very cold,2
118307.0,because the doors are closed and the cold air can not get inside,2
118567.0,this is because it is made out of metal and metal can be really cold on the inside if it is cold outside,2
150249.0,because sometimes it depends what your car seats are made of,2
136406.0,its been a cold week and sunny weak and it hasn t been driven for a week so the car would have the tempature as it did when he started the car a week ago,2
150138.0,because the sun makes the car hot,2
149961.0,it not have any heat inside the car,2
150215.0,becuase you are mixing to tempicers,2
136497.0,i think it would we warmer in the car than outside because maybe it was hot and the car obsorbed the heat from the outside so the next day it was cold and the heat was traped in,2
151229.0,when the sun is shining at the car it heats in inside of the car,2
153925.0,the black absorbs the heat so it gets hotter inside,3
