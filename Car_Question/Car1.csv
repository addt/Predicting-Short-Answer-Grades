118296,"His car should be warmer than outside because it has been out there doing nothing so it had given the car a chance to get really hot.

Katie ;)",2
118300,If all the windows are up then its going to be really warm.,2
118302,"It will be the the same temperature in the car because in the discription it says in caps ""COLD"". It also says Akbar hasn't used his car in a week, so that means that he hasn't put on the air conditioning or the heater. So that would make his car the same temperature as outside.",2
118310,"I think it would be warmer than inside because, the sun is hitting the car directly so the heat is going 
to make inside the car hot.",2
118304,It is in the sun so the sun heats up the car and the heat is trapped in the car.,3
118313,"If it is in the sun, the heat goes directly towards it and keeps it warm.",2
118319,because the temperature can change because it might have been hot one day but it says it was cold so the temperature changed to the cold,2
118297,Cars get cold if they are not used everyday and if someone didn't use there car for a week the car will be cold.,2
118298,I think it is warmer than outside because it was sitting in the sun not being drivin for a week.,2
118311,the air in the car is the same because the air has been trapped in the car for a week and it is in the sun the sun hits through the window and then air gets hit with the sun when you get in it is going to be the same like outside but if you are driving and you roll down the window fast air would come in then the car will be cool.,2
118305,it is warmer because it is parked in the sun and the car must of gotten warm by the sunlight ,2
118293,Well the car holds the cold air and more cold air keeps getting pushed in so the car will eventually get colder than the air outside.,2
118299,"Well it depends because,some cars only use cold air some hot and some have no air conditioning and some have both but all in all it just depends what kind car you have. ",2
118309,because if its a cold day then it will be realy cold,2
118307,Because the doors are closed and the cold air can not get inside.,2
118306,well my hipothisis is that the car is warmer than the outside air because it might have absorbed some of the hot air outside ,2
118308,Because it could be cold outside and you have the warm air conditioning on in your car which makes your car warmer than outside,2
118321,It must be warmer than air outside because of the fuel in the car and the things inside the car.,2
118312,I think it is warmer than the outside air because on some days we leave our car parked in the sun and than we go in the car and its warmer than the outside air.,2
118318,"the answer is that if it is iron it heats up really fast and it is very hot.
when it heats up and you touch it it is burning why ...... because it is iron
and the sun heats up the iron when it is very hot.",2
118303,I think that it's warmer than the outside air because the cold outside made the outside of the car cold and the in side must have warm air trapped inside of the car.  ,2
118314,i predictit is the second one becousen it not to cold or too hot ,2
118301,"The car will be warmer than the outside air because,its been sitting in the sun for a long time.Also if there is some cool breeze outside when its very hot the car can't get the cool air because the car is closed.And if the sun is directly hitting it the car will definitly be hotter than than the outside. ",2
118316,i think it will be warmer than the out side air because the sun has been shining into the car.,2
118320,I said this because there is usually a certain temperature outside everyday.If you want a warm temperature in your car even when it is hot outside you could possibly have your car warmer.,2
118294,His car might have the greenhouse effect so his car might be hotter inside or hotter outside or the same temperature.,3
118315,a car is built like a oven and because there is metal on the outside it will heat up fast and the contents in the inside heat up slowly then that makes the car almost like a oven :),3
118323,"I belive the car will be colder than the air outside because, the car was outside so that means all the cold air was hitting the. the car is metal so it makes the car even colder.",2
118482,I think that the car is warmer than the outside because when I get in my car when its cold its more hot inside my car.,2
118478,When it is hot outside in is sweltering in the car,2
118479,Its the same because the hot or cold air gets in the car by the engine and it can make the car warm or hot depending if it is hot or cold.,2
118480,"It might be the same temperature as the outside air because the car hasnt been driven for a week, and its been outside for a while.",2
118473,its cold ount side and when drive a car u have to wait until its warm so its probely the car will be cold maybe there is wind out side maybe the window might be open,2
118474,"becuase there are opinings in the car so the car stays the same temperture as the outside
",2
118483,This is because the Sun shined through the glass which made the car very hot,2
118470,"Usually in the morning when i go into my dad's car that is parked outside, it is colder than the outside temperature.  That is if it is cold outside.  If it is super hot outside usually it is hotter in the car than the outside temperature.  So i thought of that observation and answered the question, the car would be colder than the outside air.  It is a COLD day.",2
118472,I think it's the same temperature as outside because the car is in the sun but at the same time the weather is cold.,2
118468,"The outside would be colder because in the car, the heat is confined so it would stay warmer longer but outside the air would release a lot of the heat it had before",3
118475,The car contains heat more and if it was in the sun it would warm up.,2
118477,I think it would be the same air as the air outside because first of all if its cold outside your car will become cold so you have to turn on your car and wait for like 5 minutes for it can warm up so its basically like a human.,2
118465,"The car is closed off from the outside world, so the air would naturally be warmer in the car, although not too much warmer.",2
118487,I think the car is warmer than the outside air because when this happens to my car is always hotter that the outside air,2
118488,well usually when its hot outside the air in the car gets a littler warmer because the car is smaller in than the outside world and there are at least 1 to 5 people in a car depending on how big your car is.,2
118486,I picked that because the sun was shining on it so it must hotter than outside and its was under the sun for a week. Also it was colder outside than inside of the car.,2
118484,"It depends on the weather. In the morning the car will be cold because, it was out all night.If you did not have to go any where untill 4:00 the car will be hot if it is a hot day If not then it will be cold...That i how i know it is neather.",2
118485,"Well I think that it is warmer than the outside air because,it has been there for a week and its sunny outside and the heat from the sun shines into the windows and the car gets hotter.",2
118490,i think that it is warmer than the outside air because if its parked in the sun itll be warm inside than outside because all the heat is facing the car and the cold air is all outside ,2
118467,It is the same as the outside air because where ever the car is the air can go threw the car if the window is open ,2
118471,The sun is heating up the air inside the car but there is no cold air to cool down the hot air so it only gets hotter.,2
118469,the car hasn't been driven or even had people in it for a week so the car must be cold,2
118466,I think it is the same tempature because the warm or cold air can get in by small holes and cracks in the car.,2
118543,it will be warmer than the outside air because since the cold molecules and the warm molecules will combine and since there would be more warm air transforming in it would get warmer.,2
118515,i think it is warmer inside the car than the outside of the car because whenever my parents park in the sun in like 2 hours later it is extremely hot in the car.,2
118517,"If it hasn't been driven for a week than it would be burning hot in the inside I know this because it happened to our car before and it was super hot.
",2
118533,It will be hotter in the car because the car is insulated by the fabric and foam.,2
118518,"I think that it will be colder than the outside air because when it's hot outside your car is generally hotter than the air around you so, I think that it will be colder in your car than the air around you.",2
118548,I think it is exactly the same because its cold outside which makes it cold inside the car. like in the morning when its cold the sun could be hitting the car but the outside air makes the car no be hot.,2
118522,because the condistion makes all the windows colder which means that the inside is colder :),2
118562,well it depends on if its hot or cold.So if its hot the inside of the car will be hoter than the outside. So scence it is traped so imagen how hot it will be in the car.But if it was cold the car would feel like it is colder than the outside of the car but its really not.,2
118526,"i picked this answer because if its cold outside,but its parked in the sun then it would be hotter in the car then outside of the car.",2
118567,this is because it is made out of metal and metal can be really cold on the inside if it is cold outside.,2
118516,"The car is warmer than the air outside because if the car is in the sun then it will heat up the inside maybe because the seats are leather which makes it hot,also i have been in car so in my car the steering wheel gets hot and also the buckle gets hot.  ",2
118521,It will be warmer then the outside air because when the heat goes on to the windshield and the windows the warm air gets trapped inside the car.,3
118520,Because if the seats are leather it makes it hot.,2
118514,"If Akbar's car had been barked in the sun the car would absorb the heat, and the heat would stay contained in the car, because it does not have a passage out of the car.",3
118512,A car on a cold day is usually warmer than outside because the car is airtight so the cold air can't get in the car which is room temperature. ,2
118509,It was in the sun and was really hot but now its a cold day so the car cooled down.,2
118534,because you have air conditioning on in the car so once you come outside air.,2
118519,it is really hot out side and it is hotter then out side and you can't stand it.,2
118511,I think this answer because well if it cold outside and the car is parked in the sun then it would be the same tempater,2
118542,I think that it will be colder because if the air is trapped in the car then the inside of the car will have to even the coldness to outside.,2
118537,I think that it would be that the temperature of the air inside the car would be colder than the air outside because there is absolutely no heat in the car.,2
118529,It is warm because of the heat that was shined on the sun. IF it was longer in the sun it would have been more warmer.,2
118536,The energy was stored from the weather when Akbar closed his door.,2
118523,well when its hot inside of the car is super hot so when its cold im guessing the car is cold to,2
118530,I think it will be warmer in the car because if he didn't use it sincen one week and now its cold so in the car it's warm,2
118510,It captures the heat from the outside in when he closes the door. The heat from the outside will beat on the metal of the car and heat it up.,2
118513,i thinks its warmer because it hasnt been used for a week so its has warm air inside,2
118556,I think it is warmer than outside because the car might have been sitting outside in the sun for a long time.,2
118549,i think that the temp will be hot in side the car because it was parked right below the sun so the heat coming from the sun will effect the temp in the car,2
118607,the coldness from outside makes the car cool and the cold gets trapped in the car making it cooler,2
118622,I predict it would be warmer because it is parked in the sun and has not been on. So the inside would be warmer.,2
118604,a car is made of metal an plastic making it hotter or colder based on the out side taempreture,2
118614,"if you open the car door to get into the car you are letting the outside air into the car so therefore,the air is exactly the say.",2
118628,The car is the exact same temperature as it is outside because the sun sends heat waves to the car and the car get the heat wave and heats up.,3
118632,I think it will be the same temperature inside  like it is outside,2
118602,i think it will be warmer in the car then it is outside because the car has been sitting outside in the sun for a week and all the air has been traped inside of the car and when all that air has been traped in the car and the car has been sitting outside all of the air in the car starts to heat up,2
118600,In side a car when the sun beats down on the metal and heats the inside of the car.,2
118623,It is most likely going to be hotter that the air outside  because all of the air is trapped inside a small space and the sun is beating down on car and the car is metal.,3
118613,the sun has been pooring down on the car all week so it will be very hot,2
118610,probably warmer because the car has been out in the sun for a week without the AC.,2
118618,"If the car has not been driven in a week and has been siting in the sun,it is going to be hot. Also, the windows reflect light into the car making it even more hot.",3
118626, I think that because the sun is only hitting the outside not the inside and it is cold outside so that means that it is same inside.,2
118621,because some of the outside air goes inside the car through the window ,2
118611,the temperature is going to warm because it been in the sun for a week and the warm air inside was warm so it is make  it more warm so it is warm.,1
118606,"if it was in the sun and not used for a week and now its cold out its probably a little warmer than outside
",2
118620,it may be cold but its still hot from the sun.,2
118616,I predicted that the inside of the motor hasn't been used and is outside in the hot weather. That will cause the car to get warmer and heat up .,2
118601,I think his car will be hotter than the air on the outside because the heat heats up all metal and other contents in the car.,2
118615,"because if you leave it for a very long time, it will get even hot",2
118624,"I chose this answer because if the day is cold,nothing changes, the car still is parked in the sun and maybe the sun has been up for the whole week, so the sun's heat is focused on the car.",2
118634,the car is going to be hot because he left it in the sun and when u leave something in the sun for a long period of time it will stay hot in case he left it in the sun for a week so it will be hot.,2
118609,Since the car has air and it is hot outside the air inside the car heats up so that is how the air is warmer.,3
118612,the person in the car can turn the AC on cold,2
118947,If the windows are tightly closed then it should be warmer because the sun would heat up the outer shell and it will heat up the inside.,2
118344,The car will be hotter cause it absorbs the heat from the sun and makes the car hot ,2
118337,I chose my answer because on a normal temperature day the car would be warmer than the outside but the temperature outside was colder than a normal day so the car was heated up by the sun but cooled down by the temperature of the air outside. ,2
118358,"Because when it is hot outside it is hotter in the car so it must be the same thing
",2
118350,The car inside being warmer than the outside air makes sense because it being a cold day doesn't matter because if the car has been parked in the sun it will be warm because the heat gets to the car and since no one has opened or used the car in the past week then the cold air couldn't get into the car just the heat from the sun.,2
118353,i think that it is warmer than the outside air because if the car was not used for a week and it is parked in the sun it is going to be hot in the car.,2
118346,The car is under the sun so the air in the car is getting warm.,2
118366,It was left in the sun and has not been driven so most likely the car is warm,2
118352,The car may be exactly the same as the air outside because the engine may be shut down.The engine is a car's source of heat.,2
118355,The metal on the car warms the inside by radiating heat. witch keeps the car warm it also warms the leather since the sun shines through the window strait to the leather.,2
118338,"It's a cold day, but it is also a sunny day. The temperature of the air outside is what affects the the temperature in the car.",2
118348,I think it is warmer than the outside air because it takes in the warm air form the sun and does not let the warm air get out and does not let the cold air get in.,2
118349,I think it is the same as outside because usely when we our on a trip and we dont use are car for a while cause we use another on and its cold outside its usely the same temputer as the air outside,2
118354,"The weather out side is cold and he has left his car in the sun but,because he left his car in the sun does not in will warm because he has not used it for a week so it has to be cold inside.",2
118351,If its a cold day and the sun is shining it would be the morning so the car gets covered in fog so the car is cold on the inside.,2
118361,"The car is colder because the car does not get to hot that much as outside of the car
",2
118345,That is my answer because it has't bean opened so no colb air got in.,2
118341,The heat trapped inside the car rises to the top and can't escape while the cold air sinks to the bottom. ,2
118367,because he had his car parked on the curve he haven't been driven for a week now so the was warm because the sun heats the car up,2
118343,"I think it will be the same temperature as outside because if it's cold outside, it will be cold inside the car as well if it hasn't been driven for a week.",2
118357,it prodolly is hotter than the out side air because if you go in a car on a sunny day the car will be hot inside,2
118369,Its hot in the car because its been sitting in the sun and that effects the car.,2
118339,"I chose this because he parked his car a week ago, but it is parked in the sun and just because one day was a cold day does not mean every day was a cold day.",2
118372,"it would be colder  beacouse it has not been driven for a week ,but if it was a hot week before then then it would eather be the same as it is outside or warmer than outside.",2
118360,i dont know,1
118356,The sun is on the car to heat the car up but for a week it just get colder or hotter each day so this really depends.,2
118347,It will be hotter than the air outside because it has not been driven for a week a in side it will be hotter.,2
118371,"I think that the answer is going to be the air inside the air is warmer than outside because,it has been sitting in the sun for a week.  ",2
118368,the outside air is colder than inside air,2
118364,because i think the air would be trapped inside the car and get warmer ,2
118362,The sun has warmed the inside.,2
118397,I think that it will be warmer than the outside air because when I went in my dads car on a hot day all the hot air was in the car and it was really hot in there but not as hot outside.,2
118393, The car is warmer than outside because even though the car is off and the air is cold inside the car is still warm because the sun is hitting it so the car takes in the warmness of the sun and keeps it inside.So that is why I think inside the car is warmer than outside.,3
118417," I think this cause the heater inside the car makes u warm then the outside cause of the engine 
",2
118403,it is colder then outside because Akbar hasn't driven his car it in a week and during the nights it gets cold and all the air gets tapped in the car.,2
118410,it got hotter insid more than inside becas the hot air is traped insid the car. ,2
118392,well if the car is black in the inside and the sun is out the color black would absorb the heat and stay warm until the sun is goes down,2
118394,It will be warmer because the cold air cant come in and the sun makes it warmer in the small space.,2
118413,it is a little bit warmer because the sun is shining on it but yet again it is cold outside.,2
118408,it would be hoter the out side because the air is traped inside the car and it is is just heating up in the car,2
118409,it is going to be warmer because the sun was heating the car ,2
118401,The car obsorbed the suns energy so it would be hot even though its cold outside.,3
118405,it might be warmer because the car was parked in the sun for a week and the warm air in side the car couldn't get out so it stayed in side ,2
118402,It would be warmer because the sun has been hovering over the car for a week and the air would not effect the car because the sun is stronger then the air so it would be warmer ,2
118406,"Its warmer outside because, the air outside is cold  with the car being in the sun, IF the front window is being hit by the sun.",2
118400,l think the inside of he car is going to be warmer than it is outside because the car has not been driven for a week.,2
118415,I think the car would be warmer than the outside air because the car would preserve heat from the heat during the week from the sun.,2
118398,"I think it is waremer then outside air because i a car it is hotter then out side, some times it is cold but i think my answer is right.",2
118395,It will be colder than the air outside because the car has been sitting in the cold for a week and has not moved.,2
118412,the sun is warming the car up and the wind is only affecting the outside of the car,2
118391,The car hasn't been driven for a week so no heat has entered and on a cold day it can make the inside of a car very cold. I learned from experience. ,2
118411,The sun heats up the car even on a cold day.,2
118407,"When,I came from the pool, I found that the air was chilly. When I got into the car(it was park in the shade)it was very warm.",2
118414,The car is cooled down because the car has air conditioning.,2
118418,"I think the answer is: it is warmer outside because the sun is warm, and when it hits the glass, the glass makes the inside hot, like a solar oven.",2
118416,It would be warmer because a car gets really hot in the sun.,2
118396,it warmer because maybe  the window is close or the sun is shining on the car ,2
118419,The answer that i think it is because the sun warms than the outside air so hits the glass the heat makes the glass makes the food warm.,2
118404,i said colder then the outside air ,2
118439,"It is warmer because the heat from the sun penetrates and makes the car warm, another reason is cold air does not penetrate glass and the sun does. For example when you put a magnifying glass to wood and the sun is facing the wood it burns the wood because of the glass.",2
118437,I think the heat warms up the car. since the heat stays in the car there is nowhere for the heat to leave.,2
118438,"I think it will be warmer inside of the car than the temperature outside because in the car, it will just be normal room temperature and if its cold outside, it has to be warmer in the car",2
118443,"The car would be colder than the outside air because, the car hasn't been driven in a week and its cold outside the heat inside the car would have been turned into cold air because of the cold air outside.",2
118456,The air is warmer inside than outside because the air outside can't get in the car and the people breathe in the car and it causes heat.,2
118455,the car keeps the warm air inside but the air outside stays cold because the car has insulation.,2
118446,"I believe that the air in the car will be colder than the outside air because even though it was parked in the sun for weeks, the sun changes position so at night the car will be cold. If last night was cold and today is cold that's twice as much time the car has to spend being cold. Therefore the car air is colder than the air outside",2
118440,"It depends on the weather,if it is cold outside then it will be really cold inside the car because when it is cold outside the coldness will go inside the car and stay in there and it might also fog up the mirrors.If it is hot outside the heat will also heat the car on the outside making the heat go in the inside and heats it up and makes it warmer inside then it is outsiede.",2
118451,the car is in the sun so the car will warm up.,2
118462,it will be warmer because the sun was on the car for a week and the solar car trapped the suns energy and it is hearing the car naturally.,3
118442,"because if a car is parked in the sun, even if it is cold out, it will be warm in the car because of the fact that leather traps heat.",2
118447,"It would be warmer because the car is keeping the heat on the inside.
",2
118441,"If the car has not been driven for a week, it would be really cold, but it was parked in the sun. Also, its a cold day so the inside of the car is a lot colder then the outside.",2
118452,I think that the air inside the car is hotter than the air outside the car.,2
118461,If the inside of the car is a dark color than it will collect heat and the inside of the car will warm up.  If it is cold outside than the warm air in the car won't change because the car is insalated so the warm air stays in and the cold air stays out.,2
118460,I think warmer than outside because it was under the sun for a long time and been not driven that's why.,2
118464,it is warmer because the sun is hitting the car it is just a little bit warmer ,2
118453,If the car was in the sun a long time it would probably have warmer air inside the car than outside.,2
118458,The heat is still traped in the car but the oxegen died out.,2
118454,"It is colder than the outside air because it's been outside for a week so it's gathered all this cool air inside. So it's colder than the outside, because it has so much cold air.",2
118457,the hot air gets stuck in the car and that is how it get really hot,2
118445,"The car has been storing heat and exerting heat into the air of the car, where there are no points where the air can escape.",2
118450,I think the air inside the car would be warmer than the air outside because the car was parked in the sun it absorbed the heat and the cold air and mixed. Then the air was trapped inside the car not absorbing any air. ,3
118459,It is exactly the same because it not always hot and not always cold because it reflects the tempeture ourside.,2
118463,because the cold air is trap in side the car and the warm air is stopping from the cold air from escaping ,2
118448,Warmer because people are breathing in the car and the car is keeping the heat in.,2
118444,"the car has been sitting in the sun for a week, and since the outside of the car is metal, it acts like a thermos, and keeps the air inside the car hot.",2
118476,I think the same because its a cold day and the sun is not that warm for car to get warm.,2
118481,I say it is exactly the same because some people get home from work at maybe 7:30 PM or 8:00 PM after that they watch TV and go to bed. what i am trying to say is the car sits out in the cold all night.The car is sitting outside while cold air from outside is coming in the car through pipes and cracks. Once they wake up they do what they need to do before work then they get into their car and it is cold. ,2
118535,"i think it will be warmer than the outside air because the car was parked in the sun so, the heat of the sun will make the car warmer.",2
118540,"The air is cold because the air outside is cold even though the car is in the sun the air inside is still cold. With that said, the air inside is still cold even though the car is in the sun.",2
118544,it would be warmer than the outside air because the air is trapped inside the car and the heat through the glass warms the air in the car and since the air is trapped it cant escape and it just gets hotter and hottwe,3
118527,I think it is warmer then the outside air because the car was in the sun for a week without driving it.,2
118557,I think that it will be exactly the same as the outside air because even though it the sun is shinning it is also a cold day so the tempurature balences out with each other.,2
118528,"I bet cold air has been getting in all morning the sun might warm it up a tiny bit but not to the the point where it is as warm or warmer than the outside air
",2
118531,I think that the air in the car will be colder because the inside of the car is not completely sealed off from the outside air so some of the cold air will have seeped in and making the temperature of the inside of the car cold.   ,2
118524, I think the air in the car is warmer than the air outside because the car has been sitting in the sun.,2
118545,It makes sense that it is warmer inside the car because if you leave it in the hot sun it heats up the car  very warm. It is warmer than the outside air because the car was heated from the whole week,2
118558,It is warmer because the sun is really hot and his car was outside so it is warmer in Akbar's car.,2
118561,The day is cold and if the car is parked outside it means the inside of the car will colder.,2
118525,i think because it is out in the sun and the sun has warmed up the car for a week it is warmer than the outside air.,2
118539,the hot air gets trapped in the car or they have the heater on in the car,2
118554,"the car was in the sun, so the heat is greater",2
118566,The air in the car is warmer than the air outside because the car has been parked in the sun for a week and the car was closed so the air get warmer and warmer.,2
118565,"I think it would be warmer because the inside of the car would capture the air from the outside. However, I think it would depend on the air conditioning or if there was a heater in the car. Or if there was space to spread out, because normally warm molecules would spread out and unlike the cold molecules and the warm molecules they are the opposite of each other. With the warm molecules they would take all the room because they all would spread out. they are like that because those molecules are like us, when we are warm we spread out. When it is cold we would huddle together for warmth. For example, if you are on a cold day you would most likely stick with the person next to you. When you are hot you will ask for space, and a cold place to be in.",2
118550,"The air inside the car will get stuffy overtime. If you are in it, your sweat glands make it warmer. The engine heats up the car as well.",2
118551,I think that it is colder in the car because when it stays outside for a while the cold air goes through the glass.,2
118547,If the car has all the windows down and the sun hits the glass it will make it warmer than the outside air ,2
118560,The air warmer in the car because the sun is shining directly at the car.,2
118568,como acentroid hai aide atrapado poco a poco se emfria ,2
118553,it's going to be hotter because it's not been droven since a week so it's been in the sun.,2
118546,"When a car is left not running in the sun, the car absorbs the heat and traps it in. Even in just one day the car can reach temperatures of over 100 degrees. Furthermore, leaving it in the sun for seven days (a week) everyday will just add on to the heat making it hotter than the outside hair.",3
118538,It would be warmer because the heat from yesterday would stay in your car.,2
118552,i donot know,1
118563,It depends on the weather of the whole week and the weather of today.,2
118555,I got that the inside of the car is warmer because if Akbar parked his car in the sun in a cold day and he does not drive it for a week and the car is parked at the same place the car will get warmer then outside.The car is also warmer because the sun reflects to the glass and from the glass it may reflect to the inside of the car.,2
118569,I think that my answer is a good answer because if the day and weather are both cold so the car would also be cold.,2
118571,"since the car has been in the cold for a day,it is probably still cold.",2
118559,i dont know,1
118564,Because the outside is hot so the car will get hot in a few minutes.,2
118570,I think that that the the temperature will be the same as the outside air because the air will cool down the suns energy which makes the car the same temperature as outside.,3
118585,it will be cooler because its cold at night and it hasnt been used for a couple od days,2
118590,I think this is the answer because the air temperature outside the air will get inside from air pockets in the car.,2
118575,the sun is warming the leather inside the car and when the door opens the hot air rises and makes the air hot.,2
118594,"well the cold from outside the cars door has a line witch the cold might come in the little line of air.
",2
118586,"The car will be colder because you have kept the car outside for a week ,so the temperature will go up.",2
118595,It will be warmer because if it hasn't been use and the Windows are close the air in the car has been warmed up.,2
118578,I believe that the temperature inside a car is colder than it is outside because it has some what of a metal base and personally whenever its warm i believe the metal is warmer and whenever its cold i believe the metal is colder. So on a cold day inside of the car should be colder.,2
118593,"I think it is warmer than the air outside because its a cold day and he hasn't drove it in one week, but he parked it in the sun so it might be a little warmer than the air outside.  ",2
118582,because theirs no where the car can go so the air gets warmer and warmer and warmer,2
118587,l think the air in the car will be colder than the air outside because the cold air is inside the the car ,2
118588,Because it depends on how cold the air is on that kind of situation.,2
118589,If Akbar hasn't driven his car for a week and the temperature outside is cold  than that day then that means that over a week the car has been sitting in the hot sun and the heat has been trapped.,2
118579,It is warmer than the outside air because it has been in the sun all day and that heats up the car.,2
118603,cause when you leave the car the temperature,2
118592,I think it is warmer because when you leave your car in  the sun it will capture the warm air and keep it inside so when you open it will be warmer when the outside is cold.,2
118584,I think it will be warmer than the air outside because none of that cold air has gotten into the car,2
118576,I think that because he can heat the car up.,2
118599,It is cold because he has not driven it yet and it is cold because it is cold outside.,2
118577,"The air outside the car affect the car because if the air is hot the car will be hot too if the air outsid e is too hot the car will be hot too.
",2
118591,it must be warmer inside the car because the hot air is trapped in the car,3
118580,the heat goes in to the car when its open and the heat gets trapped in the car and it stays hot inside.,2
118598,"I think the car will be warmer then the air outside because when the car was running there was heat so the car must've collected the heat from the sun and when it was running. Although, it might be a bit colder than it was when the sun was out and the car was on, but it's still trapping heat. ",2
118581,I believe that it's warmer inside the car because its been in the sun but it's cold outside so since the sun is directly hitting the car it will be warmer than the air outside.,2
118619,Akbar's car has every thing black in his car.,2
118608,"The temperature will be exactly the same as the outside air.For example, when ever you park your car on a sunny spot it is always hot and same if you park it on a cooler spot.",2
118597,it is exactly the same as outside because the sun is is heating outside and it is also heating the car,2
118630,is warmer than out because the car is all the day clouse,2
118583,because the sun counter acts the cold day,2
118637,because it was parked in the  sun light it trap the heat in the car,3
119017,If its a cold day than your car is going to have to be cold if it's surrounded by cold air.,2
118296,"Even if it was in the sun, it would still be colder in the car than outside because it was cold outside and the car was sitting there for a week.",2
118300,Because the windows are down and the temperature is really hot inside the car.,2
118302,"I think that it will be warmer than the outside air because it says "" Akbar walks to his car that is parked in the Sun and has not been driven for a week."" It also says "" On a COLD day..."", but it never said how cold the weather was on the week that he didn't drive his car. The sentance also states that the car was parked in the Sun for a whole week, so that might effect the temp of the inside of the car.",2
118310,It would be the same temp. than outside because its been outside and it was a cold day and the sun wouldn't change the temp. inside the car because it was cold day and the cold weather would not change the weather inside.,2
118304,The sun produces solar radiation which heats up the car and the infrared radiation gets trapped in the car which leads to the temperature rising.,5
118313,The car will absorb sunlight/ radiation and will heat up the car more than the outside air.,3
118319,It would be warmer because the car would trap the heat inside the car like the solar oven would trap the heat when it was hot out and keep the heat in the car.,3
118297,Because the sun has made the inside of the car warmer than the air outside of the car.,2
118298,Its because the car is in the sun for a week and the sun is hitting the car for a long time that why I think it will be warmer than the air outside.,2
118311,the air is colder than the outside air because which ever kind of tempature stays the longest gets traped inside the car then the outside air gets warmer.,2
118305,i know that because it says that the car has been parked in the sun for a week.,2
118293,Well since the car holds the temperature of out side and so the temperature  of the car would be the same temperature or colder as the outside air.,2
118299,Well if you think about when you go inside a car in the morning its really cold and when you go outside in the middle of the day its pretty hot but all in all it all depends on tempiture ,2
118309,because if the sun is reflecting into the car it would be the same temp as the nsun,2
118307,Because there are places from were air can come in.,2
118306,i think that the car will be colder than the outside air  ,2
118308,The sun shined on the parked car and the inside of the car would be warmer then the outside air,2
118321,The sun produced a lot of solar radiation in the car and a lot of infaired radiation is trapped inside the car.,4
118312,The air inside the car is warmer than the outside air because the solar radiation should of transform into heat.,4
118318,#N/A,2
118303,the inside has trapped solar radiation heat in the car for a week through the window.  ,3
118314,0,1
118301,I think that it's warmer than the outside because it's been sitting there for days in the sun.,2
118316,i think that it would be coulder than the out side air because it is could out side,2
118320,"I chose this because if it is parked in the sun for a week,the car shouldn't have the same temperature as outside.",2
118294, The inside air and the outside air are the exact same temperature because the sun is not enough to heat the inside if the car.,2
118315,"over time the heat would have stayed in the car heating the car up over time, so even though its still cold outside it will be warm in the car",2
118323,It actually depends on the matirial in the car because if the car seats are leather.,2
118482,because it has been parked in the sun for a week.,2
118478,When the it cold outside the car can get cold when it is hot outside it is sweltering.,2
118479,it is hotter because the sun is hitting the car,2
118480,"I think that its a little bit warmer because it was a cold day but they parked there car in the sun, so the suns heat made the car a little warmer.",2
118473,because if its cold out side it must be cold in the car there might be a window open in the car slightly open or it might of absorbed the air in to the car ,2
118474,the outside air will be the same exact temperature as the inside of the car because there are openings inside the car and that will let the cold air/hot air come threw and that's how the temperature will stay the same ,2
118483,The glass makes the heat even hotter as the Sun shines on the car's windows.,2
118470,I think that it is colder than the outside air because the cold air can be trapped inside which will cause it to be cold. ,2
118472,I think it would be warmer because I'm pretty sure that the windows would be closed and the heat would be trapped inside because even though the temp. is cold that doesn't mean there isn't a sun outside.,3
118468,"I think it would be warmer because the car kept the heat inside of the air making it so the air inside of the car would be hotter than the outside hear, where as if a door was open the air would be the same temperature as the outside air.",2
118475,The sun would have heated up the inside of the car.  The car has not been driven for a long time so it has more time to absorb heat.,2
118477,I think that the car inside will be hot temperature because when you havent used a car for a while and its been out in the sun the whole time the inside of your car will get hot.,2
118465,"The air has zero reflectivity, so it absorbs more solar radiation than the car, which has a reflective metal surface.",3
118487,the car is in the sun and the car absorbs the heat so its hotter,2
118488,Since the weather outside is hot and it hasn't been used in a week it might be a little bit hotter than the temp outside because of the sun refelecting on the cars glass  ,2
118486,I chose that because the car was parked in the sun which means the sun gave the car more heat than the outside. Also it wasn't driven for a week and it was under the sun for a week which means it must have been hot in the car.,2
118484,"I think this because,every time I go in my car and it is cold out it is colder then it is outside.?",2
118485,since there is no heat outside there would be no way for the car to be hot.,2
118490,"i think it will be warmer than outside because if the sun was facing it would get hot inside and the cold air is trapped outside
",2
118467,It may be the same as the outside because when its night the car can cool down and then the next day the car can get warmed up again.,2
118471,The Solar Radiation is heat up the inside of the car and the Infrared Radiation has less places to escape so it has a higher chance of becoming and the more heat the hotter it is in the car.,4
118469,the car hasn't been used for so long that the engine is cold making the car cold,2
118466,There are small cracks inside the car like the doors and windows so the air can get in.,2
118543,it is going to be colder because the coldness is going to go inside of the car and mix the cold air and the hot air together but then the heat is going to be gone because there is so much cold air that the car will turn cold,2
118515,I think it would be warmer in the car than the outside because the glass atracts all the hot air in the car and most of the hot air stays inside.,2
118517,the metal on the car attracts heat and traps it inside the car.,2
118533,"the inside of the car will be hotter because it traps the heat in from earlier in the day, and it is insulated.",2
118518,I think that the car will be colder than the air outside because the car will trap in the air that is outside and have the air in the car become colder than the air outside.,2
118548,I think it will be the same because the outside air is where the car is in the sun my be hitting it but the coldness will balence it our,2
118522,it would be colder because there are little cracks that air can come in,2
118562,it would be warmer than the outside air because if the car hasn't been driven for a week and its been in the sun the whole time the car will absorbe the heat and scence there is know way the heat can get out of the car the heat will just keep building up.,3
118526,"I know this because if the car is parked in the sun but it is cold outside then the heat from the sun would go in to the car and the cold air would stay in the car.Also the cold air would mix with the hot air and make it kind of warm,but warmer then outside.",2
118567,"It will be exactly the same as the outside air because even though the heat from the sun will get in, the air outside is cold, so it cools the car down. also.",2
118516,I think it is warmer inside then outside because the car was parked in the sun.,2
118521,it will be warmer because the hot air from the outside goes into the car and gets trapped so the car will be warmer then the outside air.,2
118520,#N/A,1
118514,"Akbar's car will be warmer than the outside air, because his car has been absorbing heat for the last week.",2
118512,The car is sealed and will take in solar radiation.,3
118509,It has been sitting in the cold and absorbed the cold air.,2
118534,"because you have air conditioning 
",2
118519,Because the car gets the heat and then the car keeps the heat until you put the air conditioner and cools it down or you pull the window down.,2
118511,I think this because if you park your car in the sun on a cold day the the car will be exsactly the same because cars in the morning are sometimes cold like mine. ,2
118542,I think this because if its warmer inside the inside of the car will try to be the same temperature as the outside.,2
118537,I think that it would be colder because the temperature can warm up with the sun outside but inside there is not anything to make it warm up with.,2
118529,"It is warmer because since it was parked out in the sun for a week the car is heated and unlike out side it was one day it was out in the cold. So the radiation inside , there is a lot. ",3
118536,the solar energy from the day Akbar left his car was stored.,3
118523,0,1
118530,I think warmer than the air outside because maybe the solar light absorbed the air that is in the outside of the car.,3
118510,Because heat gets trapped in the materials and kept in through the glass. But at the same time when I get in the car in the morning its colder. So i'm confused.,3
118513,It is warmer because it has been absorbing sunlight and it traps the heat inside.,4
118556,I think it will be warmer because the car was parked in the sun for a week.,2
118549,i think that it will be hot because if you leave a door open the hot air will stay inside and if there is nothing open then the cold air will not get inside,2
118607,the cold atmosphere around the car will cool the car down but the sun shining in the car will heat up the inside so i predict the car will be the warmer then the outside air.,2
118622,I think it will be warmer than the outside of the car because not all of the days were cold probally cold and the car has not been opened yet.,2
118604,"the air is cold but the car is under the sun so ithink that the tempretues would balance out
",2
118614,if your car is in the heat then the heat get into the car since there is glass keeping the heat inside the car the car will be hotter than the outside.,3
118628,"It is warmer because it absorbed the heat from the sun and there will still be heat in the car, just like the solar ovens.",3
118632,"      I think that it will be warmer because its in the sun





",2
118602,i think it will be colder because the car has not been driven for a week so how is the car suppost to stay warm ,2
118600,When it is cold the car takes in the coolness.,2
118623,I think it will be warmer than the outside air because it has been in the sun.,2
118613,its been in the sun for a week and they didnt say the other days were cold,2
118610,well it could be hot but this is a cold day.,2
118618,"It will be the same as the outside temperature because even though it was in the sun, the air surrounding it is cold.",2
118626,     I think it is warmer than the outside air because the sun is reflecting the car and if it reflects the car it might obsorve or reflect but most likely to obsorve the heat.,3
118621,because it has been siting in there for a week in the sun and there is nothing to protect it from the heat so the car will probaly be warmer,2
118611,#N/A,1
118606,it is colder because the air was trapped in the car all night and the car abosorbed the warmth so now all the warmth is gone and there is only cold.,2
118620,its the same because it is cold not warm and if it is warm it gets hot.,2
118616,I predicted colder than the outside air because the car has not been driven for a week and it is a cold day.The temperature of the cold air leads energy into the car.,2
118601,It would be warmer than the outside air because not all the cold air is being absorbed.,2
118615,"Because when you leave it for 1 week, then the car gets really hot and burns when you touch,and when you get in the inside of the car,its probably getting hotter than the outside air.",2
118624,"I chose this answer because if the sun has been shining on the car for a week, the sun has just shone its light on the car, not in the car. This means that the top of the car is warmer, not the inner part of the car.",3

118612,you can put the warm air in the car,2
118947,"If the car is parked in the sun it should be hot but if it hasn't been driven in a week,the engine would have cooled down by then thus cooling down the car.",2
118344,It would be warmer because it is in the sun and it heats up the car.,1
118337,I chose my answer because on a normal temperature day the car would be warmer than the outside but the temperature was cooler than a normal day so the car was heated up by the sun but cooled down by the temperature of the air outside.,1
118358,because the question said cold and hot so it is cold outside and warm inside the car.,1
118350,It is warmer because the heat from the sun has gotten into the car but the cold air hasn't.,2
118353,Because it has not bin used for a week and the weather outside is cold.,2
118346,because a close space car will obverse the heat and the car will stay warm.,2
118366,The car has been left in the path of solar radiation rays that have been trapped in the car and the solar radiation have transformed into heat.,4
118352,"The car's source of heat is it's engine when the car is running. So if the engine was turned off, the car will either be colder then the air outside or exactly the same as the air outside.",2

118338,"I think that the temperature will be cold in the car but, warmer than the outside air just because a car is a closed space, unless any of the windows are open but thats beside the point.",2
118348,colder because at night the cold air gets in but not out during the day.,2
118349,when its cold ouside and the car traps the coldness then when its gets warm outside the car stays cold,2
118354,because the car was in the sun so it wont be as cold as outside so it will be a little warmer then outside.,2
118351,The warmth goes inside the car and stays inside the car and the cold air goes out of the car.,2
118361,I think it is warmer because he did not drive it for a week so it should be hot because In the morning the car is not that hot later on it gets hot from in side so I think it should be hot but it could be the same as well.,2
118345,This is the find because the car is not running so the cold air gathers on the inside. This is because if you open the door the cold air will get inside and it will make the air colder.,2
118341,"the car has been sitting in warm air for a week. The SR and IR will enter, and be trapped inside the car.",4
118367,because on a cold day Akbar walks to his car and he was parked in the sun he haven't droven it for a week,2
118343,"Since it's a cold day, the car will be cold as well because outside, even though the car was parked in the sun, it's still cold.",2
118357,because it would ceap some heat in the car.,2
118369,#N/A,1
118339, I chose warmer because only a little bit of outside air can come into the car and just because today is a cold day doesn't mean the whole week was cold.,2

118360,"the air from outside will afect the air on the inside,and the sun will keep the car from becoming colder than the outside air.",1
118356,even though the car us in the sun it still doesn't give enough detail so it would be colder,2
118347,It is hot because it stayed in the sun so the heat went inside the car so thats why its hot inside.,2
118371,I think that the answer is the air will be warmer than the air outside because the car is in the sun and if the car is in the sun it will get hot. ,2
118368,water than outside air,2
118364,because the cold gets trapped in the car and can not escape ,2
118362,#N/A,1
118397,I think this because when I went in my dads car like this it was the same temperature as outside.,2
118393,  It is warmer than the outside air because the sun is powerful and the car was parked in the sun. The car aborsed the heat and the glass would let out a little of that heat and the rest would stay inside. ,3
118417,because if u turn on the heater the air will heat down.,2
118403,It would be colder then the outside air because during the nights it gets cold and if it is a cold day it would get even colder.,2
118410,It is hotter than the outside air beause the outside air hase heat evrey whair and the hot air in the car istraped inside so it dosent escape.,2

118408,because any sun would heat it up,2
118409,it is hotter because of the sun and make the seat hot,2
118401,Because it probably obsorbed the solar energy from the sun so it would stay warm.,3
118405,i think it will be colder because there is air inside the car and the could not get out and its been traped in there for a long time so the could only change so that is why i think it will be colder,2
118402,colder because it has been out there overnight ,2
118406,The solar radiation would go through the metal and would stay in the car when the outside air wouldn't be able to get inside.,3
118400,it will be hotter because nobody has been in it for a week,2
118415,"The car would be warmer than the outside air because when it was hot, the car would be hot. And when Akbar comes to the car, the heat is still in the car.",2
118398,I think colder then the outside air because the temperature of outside goes in the car and it gets colder.,2
118395,It will be warmer because the heat inside stays in which makes it hot and the outside air stays the same.,3
118412,i know this because if it is cold outside and the sun is out who knows if it was hotter yesterday or cold yesterday so if it is cold today and it was warm yesterday it can be the exact tempurature.,2
118391,"When a car hasn't been driven for a week, that means no heat from the car can get in. On a COLD day and it hasn't been driven for a week, coldness will go onto the car and windows and the cold will be let in and it hasn't been driven for a week so the temperature would be even colder.",2
118411,It is a cold day so it makes it cold. Then the heat from the sun makes it warmer so it is exactly like the outside air.,2
118407,The sun will tranfort heat into the car.,3
118414,The car keeps heat in.,2
118418,"It is the same because there is no heat to warm it up, except the sun that would keep it the same temperature.",2
118416,The car would be hot then the out side because the heat goes in but does not go out,2
118396,it will be colder because since the air cant get out it can only change so since it was on a cold day it will be cold ,2
118419,I think that exactly the same as the outside air because it hot everyday outside.,2
118404,if is hot outside then is hot inside the car and if is cold outside then inside is cold ,2
118439,It is warmer because the windshield acts as a magnifying glass and heats the with allowing minimal cold air in and heats the car.,2
118437,"since the car was left outside for a while the hot air probly got trapped in there.



 ",2
118438,"If there were no windows open in Abkar's car it would be normal room temperature in the car. If it was cold outside, it would have to be colder outside.",2
118443,"The air inside the car would be colder because the solar radiation might have reflected off the car from the paint, and the air around the car is cold too",3
118456,It's warmer because the windows and doors are blocking most of the air out.,2
118455,the car contains the heat,3
118446,"It will be colder because even though its been parked in that spot for days, the sun changes position. The sky starts to get dark at around 8 and gets lighter at 6. That's 10 hours of guaranteed cold air. The other 14 hours may very from cold to hot to kind of warm. So more than likely the car will start out cold from that night and stay cold because it's a cold day.",2
118440,I think it is colder in the car because the coldness comes from the outside air and stays on the out side of the car making the coldness stay inside,2
118451,It will be warmer because I've been sitting in the Sun for a week.,2
118462,it would be hotter because all of that solar radiation has been trapped in the car  ,4
118442,because the sun will heat up the leather on the seats even on a cold day,2
118447,It will be warmer because the suns heat is trapped in the car.,2
118441,"If the car had been driven that week, the air would be the same. But since it has not been driven for a whole week, the car would be extra cold.",2
118452,i think this because the car has been sitting in the hot sun for a week,2
118461,I think it is warmer because it has been parked in the sun for a week and the heat is trapped inside like a solar oven.,3
118460,Well I chose this answer because well the sun hits the car but the sun is not that hot to the cold temp because it will just melt the snow or ice. ,2
118464,its going to be cold because,2
118453,It is warmer in the inside because the car was closed and the outside is colder and doesnt get in the car.,2
118458,The car has only kept the heat and not the solar radiation.,4
118454,"It has absorbed all this cold air so its really cold. :3

",2
118457,If it is on a cold day it would be colder inside the car because the cold air gets trapped in the car,2
118445,"If the car has been sitting in the cold, all of the heat from the car will have left.",2
118450,"I think the air inside the car would be warmer than the air outside because even though the air outside is cold, the air inside the car would be warmer because the air was trapped inside the car for a long period of time. The warms the air that has been trapped inside.",2
118459,It the exactly because ti reflect the tempeture from outside.,2
118463,because the car traps the heat in the car.,3
118448,Warmer because the car will trap in the heat.,3
118444,"Since there is not a lot of sun or radiation in the air to heat up the car, the car will stay the same as the outside.",3
118476,I think that the outside air is the same as the inside air because it is reflecting into the inside of the car even though the windows are shut or opened ,2
118481,the cold air gets through the pipes and vents so when he gets into his car it will be colder in the morning.,2
118535,"If the car was left outside for a week in a hot temperature and this one day was cold, its more than likely that the car is going to be warmer than the cold air outside.",2
118540,I choose this answer because the air inside the car con't get out because the car hasn't been driven for a long period of time and the windows are closed so the air can't get out.,2
118544,the air cant escape so the air inside just jets warmer than the outside air,2
118527,"i think it will colder then the outside air because it is cold out side so it will be cold inside
",2
118557,Since its a cold day it doesnt matter that the sun is out so the temperature is the same.,2
118528,if it is cold then the air gets in faster than light does through the small windows,3
118531,I think this because the heat of the sun shines into the car and then the glass would trap the heat inside of the car making the temperature inside the car hot.  ,3
118524, I think the temperature in the inside the car would be warmer than the outside because the car has been sitting in the sun for days absorbing heat.,2
118545,If the outside air is warm than that heats the car and then the heat stays inside and that is why it is warmer inside the car. Also the air outside is moving the wind and that is why it is more hot inside than outside.,2
118558,It is going to be hotter than outside because it has been in the sun for a whole week.,2
118561,It won't really matter how long the car outside it matters what the temperature of the day is.,2
118525,it is warmer in the car because it is a close space,2
118539,the hot air gets trapped in the car.,2
118554,the sun heats up the car so the air is warmer.,2
118566,"I think the temperature inside the car is the same as the the one on the outside, because now it is parked in the sun, but it has not been in the sun for the entire week. In the night there is no sun and maybe there was one or more cloudy days or maybe the sun was not pointing at the car.",2
118565,Its because it captures the heat in the car and warms the inside.,2
118550,"The colors of the car attract heat, and the heat gets trapped in the car.",2
118551,It will be warmer in the car because it was parked in the sun for a week.,2
118547,I think because the hotter the outside air reflects on the inside air the sun is reflecting,2
118560,it will be warmer inside the car because the sun is shining inside the car.,2
118568,porque ce emfria adentro,2
118553,It's going to be colder because the warm and the cold air mix it is going to be warmer.,2
118546,"I chose this because I am going to assume that the other days of the week were pretty warm, even if they were not the car was still in the sun which would make the car warm. Although the temperature would've have dropped a little because of the air on the cold day.",2
118538,Every time I go in my moms car it a lot hotter in the inside then the outside on a hot day.,2
118552,i don't know,1
118563,"If you have not driven your car for a week,then the heat will accustom to the outside's heat.",2
118555,I think that it will be warmer then the air outside because the air is trapped inside a hot car in a hot day and the sun will reflect strait down to the glass which will make the inside of the car hotter.,3
118569,"colder because it was in the sun but then it was really cold  on the outside and the car is always the same temputure as outside
",2
118571,Well if the car has been in the cold environment for that day then it should have been the same temperature as outside.,2
118559,jonathan hernandez22 77ghyuhyuiuhi,1
118564,When you leave the car over nights and its cold and the morning its cold.,2
118570,0,1
118585,its warmer than out side because theres some wam air inside the car.,2
118590,The car is warmer than the outside air because the suns energy is absorbed by the car so the cars air must be hotter than the air outside of the car.,3
118575,The sun is directly entering the car and has not been open.,2
118594,because if you put your car that you haven't drove for a while then the suns rays well hit the windshield and it will make it warmer,3
118586,"The car is like the solar oven,Akbar has put his car outside for a week in the sun,so the sun's heat is getting in the car.",3
118595,When you havent opened the car for a week  the air gets hotter and then that makes the car warm inside.,2
118578,If you leave a car in cold weather for a week theirs nothing keeping the inside of the car at all warm  so the the metal exterior is not going to heat up the inside at all.,2
118593,"It is exactly the same because it is a cold day, and I know he parked it in the sun, but he hasn't drove his car in a week.",2
118582,because the air in the car will get contained and get heated,3
118587,i think that it will be the same as the air outside because it is a cold day and he parked it in the sun so it must be in the same air outside and inside.  ,2
118588,Because the windows only keep physical things out but is a entrance for heat or cold.,2
118589,If the car has been sitting in the sun for a week and on that cone cold day when akbar walks to his car the car will most likely be hot because the heat is trapped in the car from the week.,3
118579,It is warmer because the car traps the heat which keeps it warm.,3
118603,"because if the car is parked in the and it is not coverd with light colors the it will get hot




",3
118592,It is the same as the outside. An example can be let say on a hot day and havent driven your car and it is hot because the car is asorbing the hot. Just like its happening the cold air in the carthat has been driven for a week. ,3
118584,I chose this answer because heat will collect inside the car.,2
118576,I think this because the the car heats up.,2
118599,I think it is colder because when I get in the car in the morning it is cold.,2
118577,#N/A,1
118591,IT will be hotter inside because the heat will be trapped inside.,3
118580,it is warmer because the heat get traped and the heat cant go out and it will get hotter.,3
118598,It would be warmer than the outside air because it still has some heat left from the sun.,2
118581,It will be warmer than outside because the sun is beaming on it and giving it heat.,2
118619,Every thing is black in/on the car and all the other days it was warmer.,2
118608,The temperature will be warmer than the air outside cause the paint that is on the car will be absorbed and it will have the heat in and so the inside air will be warmer.,2
118597,his car will be hot because it as parked in the sun for a hole week.,2
118630,It is batter because if out side is more cold than the car have to be warmer.,2
118583,because it would store up the coldness,2
118637,because it was not driven for a week.,2
119017,The car is surrounded by cold air so it will be freezing on the inside.,2
136389,"I think that the temperature inside the car will be warmer. There are a couple of reasons why I think this. My first reason is that it was parked in th sun. The sun probably heated up the car. If the air outside is cold, then the car would be warmer since it is in the sun. ",2
136362,The air particles can not spread around they are locked in the car and do not move around which will be warmer if they are locked in. The sun went into the car and stayed in there.,3
136368,Well if you have all the windows closed and you have been in the sun all week it would be hotter because all the hot air from the sun would be trapped in the car. since it was a cold day that day he got to his car it wouldn't be as hot on warmer days.,2
136372,In a car the air gets in through the windows and the air vents which makes it colder because it goes through the air conditioner vent.,2
136352,It can be warmer than the air outside because the car probably won't let the heat it collected out as easy and metal is a good conductor for heat so that would be why it is warmer.,3
136382,The car is made of metal so conduction of heat makes it hotter.,2
136374,I think it will be the same because there is no sun to beam on the car.,2
136356,"I think that it would be warmer than the outside air because it has been parked outside more amount of days in the sun than in than it was in the cold. It says that it was parked in the sun and hasn't been driven in a week. Than it says that he walked outside on a cold day, assuming it was only one cold day,and walked to his car.",2
136370,I think it is going to be warmer than the outside because the sun has been shining on the car all day long that the car will get hot because the sun is shining on it.The heat from the sun will heat the car up.,2
136354,When the car is out in the sun because there is no new air it gets hotter because there in moister.,2
136367,in the car its colder than the outside air because the air conditioner is when you bring in cool air in the car. but outside is warm enough to use the air conditioner.,2
136388,I think the air inside the car is going to be warmer based on personal experience. On a hot day my mom and I had to go somewhere and the day before we didn't even use the car. In was sitting in the sun and it was really hot inside. I had to leave my door open while I was waiting for my mom to hurry up.,2
136683,i went in to my sissters car yester day and she had not divein her car in a long time and it was not hot or cold so i am geseing from edspereants,2
136369,The car has been sitting outside in the hot sun for a week.So I think that the car has collected lots of heat energy while sitting outside in the sun.,3
136378,It is warmer in the car because the car is holding the warm air inside when outside the air is moving warm to cold. ,3
136359,Most cars tend to be warmer because the car that was already in the car is trapped inside and then a bunch of heat is going straight on to the car which makes it even hotter.,2
136390,"I had picked the last answer ""Exactly the same as the outside air"" because even though it is a cold day, and he parked his car in the sun his car is hot because the sun is directly on the car.",2
136375,Because when ever i go into my car in the morning it is always colder then outside. ,2
136384,"Even if it was a cold day outside, the sun was shining on the car heating it up.",2
136387,The car will obsorb heat from the sun resulting in the air being hotter.,2
136366,Because it would heat up because  when it's cold things also tend to heat up and because the sunlight is reflected off and hitting the car.,3
136363,It's what's present not what happened prior to him walking to his car.,2
136373,I picked this answer because it depends of how hot it is outside because it could cause how hot it is inside the car.But it can get really hot inside a car.,2
136360,Because it has isolation from the air and wind outside which makes it much cooler.,2
136364,The car will heat up in the sun and the heat will get trapped in the car causing the car to be warmer.,2
136380,"The temperature all week was probably not cold. The sun still shined through the clouds and traps it insides, making is car a little warmer",2
136391,I think this because when you close a microwave the air from the outside comes in and then it warms it up.I also think this because the machine can warm up the thing you want it to cook.,2
136379, It cools down with the air around it.,2
136377,i said exactly the same because when it is cold outside your car gets coolder and when it is hot your car gets warmer ,2
136381,"I think it is Exactly the same as the outside air because when I go inside my car on a COLD day, it is the same temperature as outside.",2
136361,As the car sits in the drive way the sun will warm it up and store heat inside when it is a cold day.,2
136685,A lot of cars have a dark colored coat of paint on it so it absorbs more light. That heats the car up. ,4
136419,The heat that was used from the engine was trapped inside the car over night so when the car is opened it is warmer than the outside air,2
136415,this has happened to me before so i know because my family has a lot of cars and most of them don't work all the way so if need to use a car that we haven't used in  while the car is gonna be hot on the inside (unless its winter).,2
136395,Heat goes to the colder object. Therefore the heat will travel to the car until the car and the outside air are the same temperature.,2
136393,"It will be the same temperature as it is outside, as the cold air outside will cool it off, and the sun will warm it up, making it the same temperature. ",2
136408,"Whenever I enter my car on a cold day, it is always colder. I think it is colder because there is no heat reflecting and being absorbed through the window into the car.",2
136421,The sun is shining into the car and heating it up.,2
136404,"I belive the air in the car is warmer because when the air is trapped in the car, it has no where to go so the air is moving around quickly- and that warms the car up.",2
136420,It is warmer because yesterday mught have been a hot day so it is still holding in all the heat from the past week.,2
136414,I think that because you have a AC (to make the car colder) and a heater (to make the car warm). ,2
136392,Since the cold air outside is bigger and surrounds all of the car then the car must be colder than the outside air.,2
136397,I think that it will warmer because I have heard that cars are 10 degrees hotter than outside.,2
136424,because it was in the sun it will absorb more light which creates more heat.    ,4
136423,"Becuase the air in your car is usually warmer than the air outside, even on cold days.",2
136403,"Even though it is cold outside, it has been sitting in the sun for a week. With the sun reflecting on it it will make the car hotter, with it just sitting.",2
136412,If your car is black it will afect the inside of the cars air warth.,2
136407,I think the car will have been heated by the sun all week.,2
136411,BECAUSE THE AIR GETS TRAPPED IN AND THE SUN IS BEATING NOW ON THE CAR AND IT IS WARMING THE AIR INSIDE THE CAR BECAUSE THE AIR CANT ESCAPE,3
136402,All the hot air adds up in the car and it gets hotter.,2
136400,Even though it is a cold day the car is in the sun and that's why it warmer.,2
136406,When you are in your car it has the same air as it doses outside. (unless you put the heater on or the AC),2
136405,I think this because if it hasn't been driven around then there can really be a lot of heat in the car. Also the car might be cold because it might have absorb the coldness of the air. ,2
136416,becuase his windshield is like a magnifind glass it heats up the car,2
136409,The windows let heat into the car but do not let it out.  The windows trap heat in the car like a greenhouse.,3
136398,"His car has been parked in the sun for a week, and even if it's cold outside today doesn't mean the car will freeze that instant.",2
136418,You could have the cooler on and that makes the car cooler than the outside air and if you have the heater on the car well be hotter than the outside air and if you have nothing on and you have the windows the car will be the same temperature as the air ,2
136399,If the sun was hitting the car for a week and just today she goes into her car the air is going to be hot but the car is going to be cold outside.,2
136417,It is warmer because in the morning it cold sometimes so you put on the heater on and becomes warmer in side the car.,2
136425,"I think that it will be warmer because sometimes on a hot day I will go in my mom's car that she drove 30 minutes ago and it's really hot. So if you haven't driven your car for a week, even if it's cold he parked his car in the sun for 7 days, it won't make a difference if it's a cold day. ",2
136394,Akbar's car is warmer than the outside air because it heat is trapped inside and was building up.,3
136422,I think it is warmer than the outside air because if his car was parked in the sun for a week and its a cold day his car would be warmer then outside.,2
136410,beacause it cant be colder than the outside air since its just the same air it would be the same.,2
136396,I mean it depends because when its hot outside and you want the AC on in the car then its cooler than the outside,2
136426,"It is colder, because since it has not been driven for a week, there is no energy to make it hotter. ",2
136413,"The sun has been on the car, so the car has absorbed the heat since it has not been driven for a week.",2
136453,I think the temperature would be colder inside the car since there would not be a lot of sunlight for the car to absorb or reflect off of. Usually it depends on the weather. Also since the air would be cold it would cool the car down.,3
136451,Most cars from the 21st century have insulators in the inside roof of the car,2
136462,If the windows are not open and the sun was on the car for a whloe week it will be very hot. ,2
136481,"If the engine has not been turned on for a whole week , the I predict that the car will be a little bit warmer than the temperature as the outside surroundings. Why I think this is because the engine usually heats up the front of the car and if Akbar (owner of the car) felt cold he would of turned off the heater inside the car and it will have a different temperature for quite a while.",2
136460,"Depending on the windows in the car, the heat will go through the window and not reflect. If it goes through and you have no sunshade your car will be warmer than outside. It's warmer because now the heat has no wear to go and is trapped in your car. ",3
136457,"This is not the best explanation, but yeah. It's warmer in the car possibly since the car's exterior is made out of metal. The heat from the sun probably is absorbed by the car's exterior and is stored into the interior of the car.",2
136459,If it's like 50 degrees outside your car is probably going to be 35 degrees because the temperature drops in certain climates like it's the same for hot weather because if it's 100 degrees your car is probably going to be 105 or less but it isn't like the air is it's just that the metal attracts the sun and it makes everything hot or cold.,2
136476,I chose colder than the outside air because I have had that happen to me.,2
136456,"Well if the car has been sitting outside on a cold day, the car will not have had the sun to warm it up outside so, it will be cold inside of the car.",2
136483,I think it is going to be warmer than the outside air because not all of the cold air is going to go into the car that is why i think it will be warmer than the outside air.,2
136463,It would be the same temperature because they are in the same place.,2
136450,The metal of the car will keep in the heat that has already been in it.,2
136482,Because in that week if there was a hot day the car would of gotten hot then since the car is like an oven it would stay hot if it was hot on one of those days.,2
136467,"The sun gives the car a warm temperature formaybethe first day, but the wind makes the car colder over many days,so the car is colder.",2
136454,Well i think that the air in a car is colder because the sun is shinning on it. ,2
136465,I this because the car could be black that absorbs the heat from the sun. ,2
136477,it will be warmer than the outside air because it has not driven for a week and has not moved places at all.,2
136468,If its really hot outside the temperature in the car is the same as the outside just like it was cold outside. in the morning the car is cold so that means if the temperature is cold or hot it is the same temperature as outside.,2
136461,the light has been reflecting off the car for a week and it has not been being adsorbed to the inside making the air outside hotter,3
136475,I think it is Colder than the outside air because the sun is outside and the  sun can warm up outside but not inside the car.,2
141559,well it depends on how light or dark the car is.if it is black it will oxorb heat to the inside of the car. if it it white it will deflect heat makeing it coler,2
136485,I think it's warmer because when it's sunny and you have your car outside wear the sun reflects your car and makes it more hotter than before . When it's sunny and your car is outside it's going to be really warm when you get in.  ,2
136452,The sun beats down on the car and makes it warmer.,2
136471,because the materal in the car will atract heat and make the car warmer.,2
136474,"The ""warmness"" of outside transfers to the inside of the car.",2
141560,,1
136469,"I choose this because there has been no heat in his car for a week.
",2
141561,I think this because the sun is hotter and there is no way for air to get in but the sun hits the roof of the car and  heats that up witch makes it so no air can get out making it trap all the heat. ,3
136480,Because the car is outside in the hot sun with no windows rolled down and hand hasn't been opened up to get aired out so of course it's going to feel really hot.,2
136464,The reason is because his car has been absorbing heat for a whole week which will make his car hot.,2
136455,"The air that is in the car is being trapped inside the car when the doors are closed, making it hard for air from the outside to wedge itself into the cars air, that unless of course you open your door or roll down your window, then the whole circumstances change completely.",2
136492,I think it would be colder than outside because their is Ac.  It also would be affected by the color of the car.,2
136500,"I chose this answer because the sun is beating down on the car. Which is creating a warmer temperature, then the outside air.",2
136494,I think the temperature inside the car is warmer than the outside air because the car will absorb the outside air. The outside air is cold but the car is in the sun and the car has not been driven for a week so that means the car has been in the sun for a week. Instead of the car absorbing the cold air it will absorb heat  from the sun.,2
136495,"I think that the car will be warmer because the sun has been shining on it for an entire week. Also, the car was most likely a little cooler when he was driving it a week before, so all the heat was moving into the cooler car all that time.",2
136499,"I say that the car would be colder than the outside air because if the car has been in the sun for a week but it is on a cold day, there is no warmth going into the car because the sun is reflecting off the car. Thus, keeps the cold air inside of the car.",2
136489,"I say that it would be colder than the outside air because since the inside hasn't had much heat absorbed inside of the car, also because the car hasn't been turned on in a week, no energy has been produced to give out heat.",2
136498,"Well, the air will be warmer that the outside air because the heatwaves already in the car has been added with more hot air. The temperature outside might have changed, but the air inside doesn't change, it only gets hotter because the air is enclosed form the car so any of the hot air can't get out. ",3
136503,It would get warmer because the car traps heat in it. It also depends on the color of the car.,2
136509,Little spaces have less room to move around and the air gets warmer utill you put the air comdisaner on.,2
141563,the sun is hot so its burning the car and inside.,2
136504,I t will be warmer because it is consuming the air . It has was out in the sun  for a long time .That is why it is going to be hotter than the outside .,2
136490,In a black car it will absorb the light and heat and make the car hotter. In a white car it will get hot but not as much heat because white reflects the light and black absorbs the lights. The sun is the main source of the car heating up.The air in the car is trapped so the car gets hotter,5
136516,"I think it would be warmer then the outside air because all the air has been captured in the car for a week, and it wouldn't be able to escape unless a window was open or a door was open.",2
136507,"If the car has been sitting dormant in the sun for a week, chances are it will have absorbed more overall heat than the outside air, especially with metal tending to grow hot in the sun and since the glass of the car has magnified the heat on the interior.",2
136515,I think the temperature would be warmer than the outside air because when i get in the car after it sitting in the sun it is hot. Also because it sits in the sun an heats the car up.,2
136501,"I think this because, even though it is cold outside, it has been in the sun for a week, and it has most likely that the car has trapped all of the ""collected"" heat within it.",2
136505,"I think it is warmer, because the light from the sun goes onto the windshield, which projects the light from the sun into the car, which makes the car hotter than the outside air, making the car hotter it was before.",3
,,1
136491,I think the car would be warmer than the outside air because of the car's engine fume's.,2
136511,because all the air is trapped inside the car and the sun is shinnying in to the car and heating all the air up an making it hot.,3
136513,"Well, at first I had to think . Its a ""cold"" day, right? But its parked in the sun and hasn't moved for a week so its probably not going to be hotter in the car because the car hasn't been opened.  ",2
136502,Because if his car was a darker it will extract heat/more cold.,2
136508,"I chose warmer than the outside because at first when the was coming the car was the same temperature as the outside, but the air was stuck in the car for 2 weeks and the air did not move or change and the sun even in a cold day can change the temprature in the car.",2
136493,I think that it will be the same because although it is parked in the sun the air around the car would be affected by the sun light too and so it would be the same temperature.,3
,,1
136518,"The temperature of the air inside the car is warmer than the outside air because all thee air is trapped inside of the car. The cars engine heating up from use could change the temperature inside the car a little It also could be because the metal on the car gets heated by the sun, which affects the temperature in the car a lot.  ",2
136512,If has been sitting in the sun for over a week without touching it you would think that the sun would make the car hotter.,2
136506,I  believe the car will be hotter than the air outside because the car traps heat in. It does because the metal conducts heat.,2
136497,I think it would we warmer in the car than outside because maybe it was hot and the car obsorbed the heat from the outside. So the next day it was cold and the heat was traped in. ,2
136514,I think it was colder than the outside air because if it hasn't been driven for a week and its a cold day then there should have been enough time to make the inside of the car very cold to make it colder than outside if it has been cold all week.,2
136519,I think it would be warmer because when you leave something outside on a hot day most likely it will be very hot. ,2
136522,If the car has been sitting unused for a while then it will have accumulated heat from hot days and the sun. How hot can depend on the color of the interior of the car.,2
136496,Warmer because the heat from the sun is heating up the car.,2
136517,"I think this because heat can radiate in through windows, but cannot radiate out, so it gets hot.",3
136520,because common sense,2
136571,"Because all the heat from the sun gets trapped on the inside of the car because the shiny acts as illnunim 
foil.",2
136550,Well if you have the air conditioning on it'll be colder but if not it could be hotter as the all the heat is trapped in there.,2
136557,"The car can be shut tight, so it can trap heat. Also, it isn't exposed to the air, so the heat can act.",2
136566,The heat of the car is hotter than the outside air because the heat is trapped. It is trapped because of the type of metal the ca is. ,2
136558,It really depends on the temperature outside because if it hot outside it will be warm inside and if its cold it will be cold inside.,2
136555,The heat will go in the car through the window and once the heat goes in it won't come out.,2
136563,"It would of traped in the hot air from the sunny weather before it was cold
",3
136556,Inside the car would be warmer than the air outside because the car traps the air and bakes it. ,2
136569,"Inside the car, it would be warmer from people, body heat, or heaters. The cold air outside would make the car cooler, until the car is the same temperature as the outside air.",2
136574,I think it would be colder because If the outside is cold and it hasn't be driven for days that mean that it has no reason to be hot.,2
136565,it will be warmer then the outside air because the inside of the car has a roof and the outside would be colder because the air is less dense.,2
136561,Because the heat gets trapped in the car and stays like that until fresh outside air gets into he car.,2
136583,this is the case because the car traps the heat it gains from the outside.,2
136551,"yes, because it has been out in the sun for a week and If you have leather seats it will be hot then you when you get in the car all the metal stuff will be hot ",2
136549,"The car is warmer, because the interior is black or gray, so it absorbs all of the color, and makes the car warmer. ",3
136570,I think that the temperature would be the same as the outside air because the car has been cooled down by the cold air but it has been warmed up a bit from the sun. Since it is being cooled down but warmed up at the same time the temperature inside the car would stay around the same temperature as the outside air.,2
136560,Because the car would trap all the hot air in the car.,3
136572,the car traps the hot air,3
136559,I think it would be warmer then the outside air because the outside of the car is medal so it would get hotter on the inside because the heat would leak into the car. ,2
136564,"I think the air would be colder because even though the slightly warm air builds up heat in the car for the week, in the night, most the heat is lost.  Every day it would go up in the day and down in the night.  The day he walks to his car is cold I think the car would be colder.",2
136567,IF the car is black it will be hotter if white it will be cooler.,2
136553,because there is no air that comes into the car to cool the car so it would be hotter.,2
136546,"The car is made out of multiple materials, such as metal, and metal heats up, a lot. On a hot day, your car could potentially be an oven.",2
136580,I think that the the car would be warmer. I think this because the sun would still be out and would be absorbing or reflecting the car. Just because the day is cold doesn't mean the inside would be the same temperature.,2
136576,i think it would be colder because a car is not just sealed shut it has a way for air to get to the inside and i think if the air is colder than the air that goes into the car it will be cold since the air outside is cold.,2
136355,"I think inside of the car will be warmer because even if it's a cold day, the car is parked in the sun for a week. Just like when it's cold, your car is a little colder inside, but when it's hot, you car it a little hotter.",2
136351,It would be warmer because when the sun hits the glass of the car it creates he going into the car. But not having a way out.,3
136389,"I think that the temperature inside the car would be cooler then the outside air. The car has not been driven for a week so the car's engine has not been able to heat the car up at all. Also, it is cold outside so all of the air that goes into the car is cold making the car cooler.",2
136373,Well i really dont know because outside when its hot the car can get heated but than if its cold outside the car can get cold to.But i just put exactly the same temperature as the air outside because it can be the same temperature.  ,2
136377,because the car ventalation hooks up to the out side ,2
136366,I said it would be warmer because first off the car could be black and exorb the heat. Also it would be warmer because solar radiation would hit it hard so sense the car  isnt moving all the heat is trapped.,4
136356,"I think that it would  be colder than the outside air because it is cold right at that moment. Also the hot air affected the temperature inside the car and it got hotter. It is like how the cold air affected the temperature, how it got colder. So i think that the cars air on the inside is colder than the outside air.",2
136363,Because the heat would be in the car and the cold air would only affect the outside of the car.,2
136375,The car is a insulator so it dose not let any heat into the car. ,2
136370,"I think that it would be the exact same temp. because even though it was in the sun all week , if it becomes a cold day it is going to become cold. Proably the same temperature.",2
136391,Well it depends on the color of the car fabric and all those things that are in a car.,2
136404,"I beleave that the car would be colder then the outside air because the car has windows, so the solar energy would reflect on the windows. And it might be warm inside the car, but not as warm.",3
136411,i think it will be colder because it has not had any movement of air and it is out side for the nigh and a night the air is cold so it would make the air in the car colder .,2
136400,The car would be absorbing the heat outside.,2
136460,If the car has been sitting for a week the air would be able to seep through the car making it cooler than outside. The car has not been heated with heat for awhile and there is no place for the cold air to go. ,2
136476,I chose A because the rest the outside air is going to be colder then the air outside.,2
136462,the car heats up when the window reflicets the sun that will heat up the car. The sun`s waves heats up the car and some of the waves leave. ,3
136504,I think that it will be warmer because it is cold out side . But it is parked in the sun for a week .Also if there is hot weather it is going to be hotter .,2
136500,I think it would be colder because it is cold outside and the outside air determines the temperature. ,2
136490,when you are inside the car and it is not running there is going to be more heat. If it is black on the outside and the inside it gets hotter then if it was white.,2
136505,"It will be warmer than the outside air, because the sun gives off solar radiation which turns it into heat energy, and the car keeps the heat inside of it, so, when its outside in the sun, the car will be hotter than the outside temperature.",5
136509,Because you put the A.C on in the car.,2
136519,It would be warmer because if it was parked outside on a hot day because the sun rays get trapped in the car and turns into heat.,5
136495,It will be colder than the outside air because all of the heat from the car when it was originally parked was drained out because of the cold air on the outside. (warmer things move to cooler things),2
136550,"It should be warmer, it depends on the other days and the sun position, if it was hot on other days then it was most likely warmer then the outside air. Also, if the sun was directly on the car it would be hot from the light. One last thing is how small the car is, it traps in a lot of heat which moves around in that small space which makes it hotter.",3
136572,I chose this because the sun has been aiming at the car so the car traps the heat and when it's very hot i go in the car and its very hot inside. ,3
136557,"Outside of the car is cold, so the the car would be cold. Even if the sun is shining on it, greenhouse gases over rules albedo.",2
136563,The hot air will counter act the colder air,2
136518,"The temperature of the air inside the car is warmer than the outside air because all the air is trapped inside of the car. I think that it will be warmer because it is parked in the sun. But, it is parked in the sun for a whole week. Also, if there is hot weather it is going to be hotter. The cars engine heating up from use could change the temperature inside the car a little It also could be because the metal on the car gets heated by the sun, which affects the temperature in the car a lot. This even mostly depends on if the car is an insulator or conductor. I also think it could be exactly the same as the outside air because heat goes to the colder object. This means that the heat will travel to the car until the car and the outside air are the same temperature.    ",3
136381,"I think that Akbar's car is the exactly same temperature as the outside air because the car hasn't been driven for a week. The sun and the temperature outside doesn't affect the car's temperature. And I know because when I go in my car on a COLD day, the car's seats are as cold as ice!",2
136359,Well if the car is black then the outside is going to be hot but if the inside is all black too then the inside would be hotter because there are more things to reflect off of.,2
136372,I think it's warmer because the metal reflects the heat inside.,2
136382,"If the car is in thee sunlight it is absorbing a lot of the solar radiation that the sun is radiating making the car heat up because metal is a conductor. The car may not have gained any heat from the hot engine, but it is definitely warmer inside the car.",3
136683,it would be warmer because when he park it in the sun the car would adsorbed the heat,2
136390,I think that the air would be colder in the inside than the outside because on a cold day he parked his car in the sun and he has drove it a a week.,2
136388,"I am answering this question based off experience. On a cold morning, my mom and I went to the car that had not been driven in a few days and it was freezing.",2
136362,It would be colder than outside because there is no sun to heat it up inside like a oven. The cold air goes in the car an does not escape. It has not been on either so that means that the engine wont make the car warm. The engine makes the car hotter. But the SUn from before was making it hot except now it is a cold day with no sun.,2
136374,Because some heat has been absorbed and hasn't been let out.,3
136380,The car has been sitting in the sun so it might heat up the car a little bit so it will be hotter than the temperature outside the car.,2
136378,The warm air from the days before the cold day would keep the car warm and the car will keep the air in and so the air would be warm for Akbar when he gets in his car.,2
136367,I think it would be warmer than the outside heat because when the sun hits the car it will absorb heat because the glass will absorb the heat there for it will make the car inside warm.,2
136352,The car has not been driven and is parked on a cold day is warmer because it is parked in the sun and cars are made of metal making it a good conductor of heat. That is why it would be warmer.,2
136360,because the air outside heated it up the inside.,2
136379,The cold air outside conducts inside the car and makes it cold like outside.,2
6971,When your out of the car and everything is closed the sun is reflecting in the car.,2
136368,I think it is warmer because the heat is trapped in the car and probably doesn't have any windows open so the heat will stay in.,3
136364,The car hes been sitting in the sun for a week and the heat will be trapped inside the car.,3
136384,Even if the temp. outside is really cold the car was still parked in the sun and the windows should have magnafied the suns heat. This should make the car warmer (not by a lot) than the outside air.,2
136393,"If the car has not been driven for a week, the car will heat up the air inside the car. But due to the cold air outside, the car will be cold inside, and the cold air will be heaten up by the sun. This will make the air slightly warmer than the air outside.  ",2
136413,"The car was in the sun longer than it was in the cold, it has also not been used at all.",2
136394,The cars air would warmer than the outside air because the heat has been trapped in the car.,3
136405,I think it's going to be warmer inside the car because it is taking in the heat and is keeping some of it in the car. This keeps the car warm.,3
136423,On cold days mycar is usuallycolder then the air outside.,2
136398,"I chose this answer because it's been parked in the sun all week, and the glass/windshield absorbed the heat in the atmosphere and that means it will be warm when you get in.",2
136414,I think that it wold be warmer than the outside air because it had been counselled. ,2
136408,,1
136420,"If the car has been in the sun the for a week without moving then it is probably hotter than the air around it. I say this because maybe the rest of the days that the car has been there were hot and that air went inside the car and is still there so the heat is trapped. Also, maybe the sun being on the car on a cold day keeps the car warmer.",2
136419,The heat from the sun has been trapped inside the car thus the air inside the car is warmer then than the air outside.,2
136424,It will stay the warmer because the car is made of metal and it will absorb the cold and the light. It will be warmer but it wont be very noticeable.,3
136392,Since the cold air outside is surrounding the car more then the car will conduct more of that cold air and get colder than the outside. It's like when I get in the car to go to school and it's cold in the morning the car feels colder than the outside air.,2
136426,"Because if you haven't driven your car in a week, and the air outside is cold, then it is the same temperature.",2
136685,The car is made of metal and metal is a conductor and a conductor produces heat.  ,2
136403,"I think his car is colder than the outside air , because it has been sitting in the sun for a week, but it was cold a old day when Akbar went to his car. Even though the sun is shining on it and it it hasn't been driven for a week it is still probably colder than the outside air.  ",2
136422,I feel like it would be warmer than outside air because the car has been in the sun for a week and hasn't been driven.  All the car as absorbed the heat from that week.,2
136416,the heat is being trapped inside of the car then coiling up that heat until it can be released,3
136425,"The inside of the car is going to be exactly the same as the outside air because when I go into the car in the morning and it's cold outside it's cold inside the car too, then we have to make the car warmer. It's been in the sun for a week but it hasn't been turned on. For me that's just a day so if it was in the sun for a week it's going to be cold.",2
136395,"Since heat always travels to the colder object, heat will transfer to the car until the car and the outside air are the same temperature.",2
136474,"The metal conducts heat, even if it is cold, because cold is heat.",2
136467,"I chose exactly the same as the outside air because since it was a cold day and not warm, the car did not have any heat to absorb.",2
136463,"I think the air will be cold because, its been sitting in the cold air all day.",2
136483,I think it is warmer inside than the outside is because the heat is going to go to the inside of the car to warm up and the outside of the car is on the outside so it is going to be the same temperature as the outside air and the inside is going to be warmer because all the heat is going to be stuck inside roaming around stuck until someone opens it.,3
136461,The heat would be trapped in the car and the outside of the car would be freezing because all the heat is being trapped in the car,3
136465,It will be colder because he hasn't drove it in a while. You would need to have the car on to make it warmer. ,2
136459,When the air is cold outside your car is going to attract the heat faster just like if it was very hot outside your car gets very very hot like if you've ever been in the waterworld parking lot then your car and seat belts get really hot because the metal or leather whatever it is attracts whatever the radiation puts on it.,2
136485,"Because if it's cold and it's parked somewhere sunny it will basically be the same as the outside air . Why,because when there's cold and warm it will contain like the same as the outside air. Also because it's a cold day and his car is parked somewhere sunny doesn't change anything except one thing  .",2
136455,The air has been trapped in this car for a week in the sun making it warmer than weather temperature,2
136453,Since the day is cold the car had not heat to absorb keeping the same temperature as the outside.,2
136477,It will be warmer than the outside because it has been in the same spot for weeks.,2
136517,"I think it will be warmer because all the heat goes n, gets trapped by the glass and insulation, and just keeps gaining because the metal on the outside takes in heat, and the rubber and air on the tires keep it all in.",3
136496,The car is parked in the sun and closed so it will not leak heat.,3
136489,"I say it would be colder because of the cold air trapped inside of the car. The cool air doesn't escape, staying the same temperature. It will drop over time with the cool air staying.",2
136511,because there is already air inside of the car and the reflection of the sun to the car windows are heating up the air in the car.,2
136499,I say that it is colder than the outside because the color of the car would reflect the sun keeping the inside very cold.,2
136506,"Well, metal conducts heat because it is a conductor so it is reasonable that the car would be warmer than the air around it.",2
136497,The tempeture inside the car is warm becaus the warm air goes in and then it isetraped in. ,3
136508,I chose warmer than the outside air because the sun is going to the car and the air in the car can't go out so the air in the car will heat up and will make the car warmer.,3
141563,if you leave a car outside in the sun it will get hot and the sun points at the car window and reflects into the car and its been a week so its hot.,2
136501,"I think this because, although it is a cold day, all of the heat that has been in the car the whole week, will have been ""kept"" in the car, so it will be warmer than the outside air.",3
136493,I think that it would be like this because the car is parked in the sun and the sun would heat it up.,2
136512,If his car has been sitting in the sun for a week without being driven then it should be warmer just from sun rays even if the car is white.,3
136503,"The only thing heating up the car is the sun and there's two things that can make the car colder. One it hasn't been driven for a week, two its a cold day.",2
136498,"The temperature will be exactly the same as the outside air because The outside air is what comes into the car to make it hot or cold, so it would be the same temperature as the outside air. ",2
136520,because the heat from the sun is absorbed.,2
136494,The temperature inside the car would be warmer than the outside air because since it's been in the sun for a week the car would've absorbed all the heat and reflected the cold air.,2
136514,I chose colder than the outside air because because since it's cold outside and the car has been just sitting there for a whole week the car must be colder than the outside air because when an object is to be  put out in an area that is either hot or cold for a long time period the object inside is supposedly supposed to be colder or hotter in the inside.,2
136522,"I think that the inside of the car will be warmer than the outside air because it has been absorbing solar radiation from the sun, acting like a solar oven. ",4
136558,Because the interior can be black and absorb heat and the warm air can get trapped inside the car. ,3
136567,the car absorbs most of the heat and it depends on the color of the car.,2
136555,The heat came in through the window and the heat could not come out because the heat reflected from the window.,3
136571,Becasue when you park your car in the sun the car gets really hot.,2
136551,it is the same because it has been in the sun all week but once in the cold it gets cold,2
136566,Because the car is absorbing more heat.,2
136549,I think that the car is hotter than the outside air because we learned in the wise project that when sun light hits an item it absorbs the light and makes it hotter. ,3
136355,"I think that Akbar's  car will be hotter than the temperature outside because when my mom's car is out in the sun for a long time, it tends to be hotter inside. Also, depending on the car's color, it will absorb more heat.",2
136492,I think the air is cooler than outside because the person might be running the AC.  Also might be because the gas in the tank might be causing the car to be cooler.,2
136361,The air in the car is warmer because when air sits in a place where sun is beating on it the air gets warmer. For example when it was sunny out and I went to a carnival we left our car and as it sits the air got hotter so when we got in the air was hot.,2
136354,I think it is warmer than the outside because the solar radiation can come in and become heat but the heat can not leave so more heat will come in and then eventually it will be hotter because there is more heat. ,4
136387,The car has been sitting outside for a week so the overall temperature will be about the same.,2
136369,If it's been sitting in the sun for over a week it's most likely to absorb the radiation which would be converted to heat.,4
136351,I said that it would be warmer inside the car because when the sun hits the glass in the windows it creates a beam. That produces heat and that heat makes it warmer inside.,2
136421,The energy from the sun goes into the car and turns into heat. It then stays in the car and the car gets hotter.,5
136397,"I think that the air inside a car would be warmer than the air outside of a car. I think this because inside side the car the only way they heat can get out is if you roll down a window or open a door, but if you have all of the doors and windows shut in your car the heat can not come out.",2
136412,warmer beceause even if the car is white over a week it will most likely be warmer than the air outside.,2
136399,The car is going to get hotter inside then outside air because the heat is trapped in side the car.,3
136402,All of the heat will go into the car. All that heat that went in the car will stay in the car unless the window is open.,3
136396,                                                                                                                           I picked this answer because when its cold out side its gonna change the temp in the car.,2
136407,"The car is in the sun, but it's a cold day, so the temperature of the cold and hot will level out. However, this depends on the color of the car.",2
136406,Its been a cold week and sunny weak and it hasn't been driven for a week so the car would have the tempature as it did when he started the car a week ago.,2
136417,I think it will be exactly the same because it can get inside by the heat/ace vent and be the same as the outside air.,2
136410,because it is trapping the heat from the sun.,2
136409,The heat from the sun gets trapped inside the car which makes the car hotter than the outside.,2
136450,The car has been in the sun and has been absorbing more heat than it is escaping.,3
136451,Because it may be warm outside but after a week of the car being cold the car won`t heat up for a really long time. The car might be a little effected by the change of tempatures outside but it will still be cold inside the car by quite a bit,2
136468,Its going to be the same because every day the temperature changes because one day its cold and one day its hot so at night it starts cooling down. Then at 12:00pm the sun starts to hotter and hotter and eventually the car stars to get hot.,2
136480,"The reason why it might be cold because he has not been in the car for a whole week, and if it's a lighter color car, and the cold air is trapped inside of the car and it is outside.",2
136482,I think the air outside will be the same temperature inside of the car because of it would be warm outside because its a cold day but the sun is shinning. If the temperature inside of the car is cold and the sun is shinning on it that would also make it warm.  ,2
136457,"The air outside is cold, yet the sun is heating it up with solar radiation. On days like these, the car is just the same temperature. The car usually is the same temp of cold days; on hot days though the car is waaaay hotter inside and out.",3
136456,"It has had no heat inside of it what so ever in a week, causing the inside temperature to keep in the cold air it's had for a week. Also it maybe could be a little warmer depending on how the car absorbs and reflects heat.",2
136454,It is warmer than outside because it has not been used and all that heat that was in there has no way to get out. ,3
141561,I think it will be warmer because the car inside the heat will get trapped in from the sun when the sun hits the roof or sides of car it will get hotter because they could have black seats making it hotter.,3
136475,Akbar's car will be warmer than the outside air because they have not opened the car door in a week so all of the heat stays inside the car.,3
141559,the reason it will be hotter is because the car has glass leting sunlight inside the car and the longer the sunlight goes in the car the more and more the heat will increase ,3
136481," The car is like a greenhouse but it doesn't have all of the plants in it, the hot air transferred into the car and kept getting warmer and more hot air because of the sun.",3
136469,I think it will be warmer because it has been parked in the sun for a week with no activity it does not matter how the temputure was that day but what it wasduring the week.,2
136507,"The weather outside and over the week will have been focused on the car causing the heat of the sun to be trapped inside the car, especially since materials such as glass and metal will have enhanced the inside temperature. ",3
136502,I think so because I have experienced it in my dads car when the air outside is cold my dads caris colder because metal is a conductor.,2
136515,It would be warmer than outside because a car can trap heat inside if all the windows are up and if the car is a darker color like black it absorbs heat.  ,3
136553,because if it was in the sun then that means it will be hotter and if it's cold outside it might affect the car a little but if the car was in the sun for a week then it would take some time for the car to cool off.,2
136583,This happens because the car trapped the heat from the past week.,3
136546,"The car is made of materials that will take and trap heat, which makes the car hotter",2
136574,I think that it would be warmer on the inside than in the outside because when the solar rays hit the front of the car and when it wants to leave the glass makes it really hard to. besides since it has not been driven for a week when someone opened the door the heat would escape but since no one drove it than the heat can't escape. ,4
136570,I think that the temperature would be warmer than the outside because the sun shines in to the car and creates heat. Even thought the outside air is cold the car will still be warmer because when the sun's rays make the heat the heat gets trapped. ,5
136569,"I think the car would be exactly the same temperature because even though it's a cold day, the sun is out and if the interior of the car is darker, it might be even warmer.",2
136580,I think that the car would be warmer because the sun would still be radiating heat.,3
136564,"The outside air would be colder because even though it is a cold day, the heat and greenhouse gasses build up in the car and the windows of the car trap the heat in.",3
136559,"I chose warmer than the outside air because the glass heats up and it makes the whole car hotter, even if there wasn't a lot of sunlight .",3
136561,"Once the heat gets in it get trapped in there, building up greater temperature inside than outside.",3
136576,i think that the car would be warmer inside because in a car there aren't much places to get cold air in but if the windshield is wide open and the sun is hitting it and not much air is coming in then the sun will heat it up because once the hot air comes in then most of it stays in. and if it stays in then when more hot air comes in it will get hotter and hotter.  ,3
136556,I say warmer because it has been out during all those warm days and a single cold day will not immensely change that.,2
136560,Because when the sun shines on his car it traps some of the heat. ,3
139536,"The air inside the car would be heated air from the sun. Compared to the cold air outside of the car the air, the air inside would feel warmer due to being heated by the sun.",2
139541,"The car has been parked in the sun. which warms up the car. Air is an insulator so heat is slowly removed from the car, thus the temperature of the air inside of the car is warmer than that of the outside air.",2
139545,Warmer because heat gets trapped in the car meaning that temperature would increase.,3
139542,"The car is made of metal and glass. As the heat from the sun passes into the car, it is absorbed and stored. The concentrated sunlight starts heating up the car and it ends up warmer than the outside air. ",2
139540,"The car is warmer than the outside air, because the air could not go into a closed car.",2
139866,"The air or breeze can be a different temperature than the sun light hitting the car. I feel like if the car is getting direct sunlight, then it will be a different temperature than the outside air or breeze. When I read outside air, I am thinking about a breeze.",3
139544,"Based on my prediction, I think that the air inside the car would be warmer than the outside air even on a cold day because the sun rays shoots out not a lot but some heat that travels through the roof and/or windows that eventually gets trapped inside the car allowing the warm temperature to spread within the car.",4
139864,The car will reach equilibrium temperature with the outside air. ,2
139863,"When Akbar left his car out in the sun for a week, all the heat from sun shines into the car storing heat inside the car. ",2
139495,The car collects and traps the air inside by the greenhouse effect where the cold air can't escape.,3
139494,"The temperature of the air inside the car will be warmer than the outside air because if he parked in the sun and has not been driving for a week, then the heat inside the car when it is heated by the sun will stay inside even if it is a cold day.",3
139492,The material of the car traps heat from the sun.,2
139824,"I predict that the car will be the same temperature as the outside air because even though the car was parked in the sun for a week, the air outside can affect how hot or cold the car would be. Since the air is cold outside, the car's temperature will go down.",2
139482,"The air inside the car would be warmer than the outside air because the car is an enclosed environment so it cannot mix with the cold air outside and since the sun is giving off heat in the form of radiation, the car's outer walls absorb energy and windows allow radiation to heat up the seats in the car. All this is trapped, more or less, inside the car making the air hotter than the outside air",4
139493,"The heat from the outside of the car enters in through the windows and heats up the car. The heat however is unable to exit the car, causing the temperature of the inside of his car to be much hotter than the outside of the car.",3
139483,"The radiation of the sun should warm up the car (how when it's hot outside, the car is warm). Also, because the air inside the car is in a closed 'container' - not being exposed to the air outside of the air; the temperature of the car does not change (heat traveling from higher temperature to lower temperature). Thus, the air inside of the car will heat up due to the radiation of the sun. ",4
139834,"Glass is an insulator, but sunlight and radiation can be passed through them, causing the car to heat up. The heat does not escape as easy as it gets in.",4
139515,"The temperature of the air inside the car is not affected by the wind currents that happen outside the car. Convection occurs outside which reduces the temperature of air outside the car. However, the air inside the car is shut off from wind and left to absorb all the heat from the sun's radiation.",4
139831,"The sun heats up the car, thus heating the air inside the car up because the car is made of metal and metal easily conducts energy. ",3
139525,The car's walls will act like an insulator and trap the heat from the solar radiation in.,3
139514,"Although it is a cold day, the sun's energy shines into the car and the car traps most of its energy inside. Thus, it would be warmer inside the car than the outside.",4
139520,"Even though its a cold day and the car is parked in the sun, the temperature of the air inside the car is warmer than the outside air because there is no wind current inside the car while outside the car, there is convection occurring.",2
139518,"The inside of the car will be warmer because the car will trap the radiation entering the car.  Radiation can enter the car, but cannot escape, called greenhouse effect.  The sun's radiation will slowly warm the car up during an any temperature day.",4
139527,"The warmer because the sun would have provided sunlight, or heat,  to be trapped in the car.",3
139506,"This is because the air particles in the car have the temperature of the outside, and over time they tend to heat up each other, and pile up the heat to make a higher temperature.",2
139832,It is warmer than the outside air because the glass windows allow heat from the sun to get in and traps it inside the car. The cold air outside barely affects the inside of the car.,2
139833,Heat gets trapped inside the car and cannot escape so the inside of the car will be warmer than the outside air. ,3
139505,"Radiation from the sun will transfer heat energy from the sun to the car, as well as conduction of the heated metal of the car to the air will also heat up the insides of the car. However, heated air trapped in the car will not be able to escape the car through convection, so the air inside the car will be warmer than that of the outside.",4
139508,"The sun's rays are radiating on the car's surface, but the large volume of air creates an insulating effect, maintaining the temperature inside the car to be the same as the air outside. The heat from the sun is being spread apart by the air surrounding the car, so the rate of heat flow is extremely slow, meaning that the heat gain or loss will also be slow enough so that it is not noticeable since this also means that the radiation is not strong enough to penetrate the car's exterior. Like two objects of different temperatures, the car and the air will reach equilibrium eventually",3
139507,"Usually when it is cold but the car has been sitting under the sun for awhile, the car feels a lot warmer than the outside air and this is just based on personal experience.",2
139836,The Temperature of the air inside the car is warmer than the outside air because no outside air can penetrate through while the car is closed. Which traps the heat inside your car.,3
139526,The inside of the car will be warmer than the outside because even if it is a cold day there is still radiation of the sun that can heat up the car since it is made of metal.,3
139528,The car will hold the heat that it collects from the sun just like a green house would.,3
139521,"The car absorb heat that came from the sun through radiation through out the week. The cover of the car serve as a insulator that store the heat in the car. In a cold day, the cold through convection only affect the surface of the car, but not the air inside of the car.",3
139517,"Even though the day is cold, it is in the sun so the solar rays will go into his car and become heat inside the car.",3
139861,It is hotter because the space is limited and the hot air will keep circulating around the car while outside the air has the whole atmosphere to rise up and cool.,3
140326,Since it has been parked outside for a week in the sun the car has trapped heat so it will be warmer than the air outside. ,3
139543,This is because inside the car the air is trapped and has no where to go. Since it is cold outside the temperature would be the same because it should not be possible to heat itself up or cool itself down. ,2
139865,The air trapped inside the car would have been able to heat up due to amount of space that is limited so the air would be warmer than the outside.,2
139538,The cold air outside will gradually decrease the warm temperature that was inside the car eventually bringing it to equilibrium.,2
139533,I think the car might retain the heat and be hotter than the outside temperature. ,2
139539,Air is a good insulator so the heat of air will be warmer over a longer period of time.,2
139537,"Because the air inside the car will be heated up by the sun and since there is no fresh air coming in the car, convection will not occur and the car will be hot inside.",3
139862,"The heat that is inside the car is trapped inside, and most of it does not leave the car which would make the car warmer than the outside.",3
139535,"The heat that has accumulated from the sun will not be able to escape from the car that easily, so it will be hotter inside than it is outside.",2
139534,The air inside the car will be warmer than the outside air because the heat energy coming from the sun would be absorbed by the roof of the car and will be stored inside the car.,3
139487,"From past experiences, cars are different temperature from outside because it traps the temperature inside.",2
139826,The air in the car is warmer than the air outside because it has been contained in the same space for a longer period of time. The rays from the sun has been keeping the air inside warm even through the cold. The air is more contained and given heat through the sun's rays. ,4
139481,The temperature of the air inside the car is warmer than outside air because the sun rays coming from the sun is being trapped in the inside of Akbar's car.,3
139485,The radiation gets trapped in the car which causes the temperature of the car to be higher than the temperature outside.,3
139497,The temperature inside the car will feel warmer than the temperature outside the car because it has been in direct sunlight meaning it has been absorbing the heat from the sun directly which will make the car's temperature feel hotter than it does outside.,3
139479,"Based on experience, a car is hotter on the inside than it is outside on a hot day. The energy that enters the car from the glass will stay trapped in the car. The car should be warmer than the outside air.",4
139480,"The glass of the car produces a greenhouse effect, trapping the heat from the past days. So even though it is cold on that particular day, the heat that is trapped is still in the car. Thereby, making the interior of the car hotter than the environment that the car is in. ",3
139496,"When the car starts, the car will slowly warm up even without a heater. But the fact that the car hasn't been driven for over a week tells you that the car would be colder than the outside air. All the cold air seeped into the car because it hasn't been started for a long period of time. Especially when Akbar is walking to get his car on a very cold day, the temperature of the car inside would most likely be cold too.",2
139488,"The air inside the car would probably be more compact and not as exposed to the air outside the car, so it would be warmer.",2
139477,I believe that the inside of the car is warmer because it has trapped the heat from the sun inside without releasing that much of it when it got cold; so the air inside is warmer than the air outside.,2
139486,"The reason why the inside of the car gets much warmer than the outside is due to the idea of the green house effect. When the trapping of the sun's heat in a planet's,or in this situation the cars, atmosphere due to the high transparency of the atmosphere to visible radiation from the sun than to infrared radiation emitted from the planet's surface.",2
139830,"Over a period of time, all of the heat from the sun will hit the metal surrounding the car, causing the car to rise up in temperature on the inside of the car. ",2
139501,"The inside of the car would be warmer than the outside of the car because it has been parked outside for a while and since the car contains materials that conduct heat, it would take longer for it to cool down even if it is a cold day but eventually it would match the temperature of the outside. ",2
139829,It should feel cool since it is a cold day. Even if it is in the sun it does not affect much inside the car. In the morning the sun is out but the car is still cool because we have not driven it for hours and it takes a longer amount of time to heat up even if the sun is out. The sun is not shining bright enough to give the car that has been stationary for a week. The sun should have probably made it warm but the engine is not warm so the inside of the contained car is very cool.,2
139489,I think it is warmer than the outside air because the car probably acts as a greenhouse which traps heat energy emitted from the sun. ,4
139490,"Heat that has been reflected and refracted upon the car has been conserved in the car. Cars are made with metals so they tend to retain to heat a lot more. even if Akbar were to open it on a cold day, the inside would still be warmer than the outside. ",2
139491,"while Akbar park outside in the sun, the ray from the sun turn into heat as it hit the car, due to the car structure, the heat couldn't really escape, so its a continuous building of heat inside his car and the car would be much warmer than the outside air ",5
139478,"Since it is in a closed space with no openings or cracks, there is nowhere for the air inside to escape. So the warm air stays trapped inside the car and does not allow the car to cool down, instead it makes the car hotter. Even though the air around is cooler there radiation of the sun gives off heat inside the car",4
139827,the sun is hitting the car directly so the heat is trapped in the car it is not getting out because it is not ventilated ,3
139498,The heat that was transferred by radiation is trapped inside the car so therefore the air inside the car should be warmer that the air outside on a cold day. ,4
139499,Through personal experience I noticed on a cold day the care will most likely to cold inside due to air coming in through small vents.,2
139823,"The period of the car parked in the sun has been extensive. Extensive enough to have all the heat compounded into a enclosed space. Therefore, all the warmth has been collected making it warmer than the outside air.",2
139509,"I think air inside the car will feel warmer than the outside air because when I enter a car that has been  sitting outside for hours, the air inside feels warmer than the air outside.",2
139510,"Some of the heat from the sunlight is trapped inside the car, therefore it should be warmer since the outside is cold.",3
139513,The car is warmer because it traps the heat inside from solar radiation.,3
139523,"I think the air inside the car is cooler because, a car;s outside parts are made of metal which transfer heat at a high rate, therefore it will keep the inside of the car cool if the car is inside shade or a place that is cool but if it is hot outside and the car is outside, then the temperature inside the car would be hotter.",2
139524,"I think that the heat in the car can come in easily, but will take longer to escape.",2
139519,"The sunlight gets through the windows of the car, and also hits the surface of the car heating up the interior. Although not all the heat can escape the car, so the heat gets trapped inside heating up the car overtime.",4
139522,"If you leave something out in the sun by itself, it will heat it up. ",2
139516,The temperature in the car would not have changed that fast to the cold air outside if it has not been used and just parked there.,2
139511,"A car contains metal which are good conductors of heat. If you leave a car out in the sun for a very long time, the air inside the car will be unbearable to be in and will be much hotter than the outside temperature because there is no room for the air to escape so the air molecules will keep bouncing around inside the car. Same for cold temperature on the outside. The car will feel much more colder inside than the outside if it is snowing or something like that. ",2
139536,"The materials the car is made out of, will allow radiation to go into the car and turn into heat. The heat that is inside the car will not be able to be released due to the cars materials be insulators.",5
139541,"The material of the car consists of insulators so when radiation from the sun enters the car, it will stay in the car. It takes a long period of time for the heat to release.",4
139497,I believe that the car is warmer than the outside air because it has been sitting directly in the sun so the air inside of the car should be warmer than the outside air.,2
139487,The car is sitting in the sun so the heat from the sun will be transferred into the car and trapped inside.,2
139826,"The solar radiation being emitted by the sun has been been converted to heat energy in the car. That heat energy has been in the car for a long time, it has been retained. The air inside the car is warmer than the air outside the car.",5
139493,"The heat is trapped within the car, and the heat is unable to escape the car, causing the interior of the car to be warmer than the outside of the car.",3
139513,Temperature is warmer on the inside because heat is trapped inside.,3
139834,The glass traps the heat from prior to the cold weather.,3
139831,The temperature is warming inside the car than the outside of the car because the heat is trapped inside. ,3
139516,It is going to be warmer the air outside the car because the air inside the car is warm and it gets trapped inside the car.,3
139836,Because air is trapped inside his/her car which would mean the molecules are not able to escape which heats up his car. also no outside air can penetrate inside the car.,3
139545,"The radiation is sent into the car , but the windows keep the heat from escaping, which in return traps heat and increases temperature.",4
139538,"Since there are many glass panes on the car, it will help keep the heat inside; glass is a good insulator. Also, not many openings are there so the heat will stay inside for a while as well.",3
139533,The car is made of metal and glass and absorbs the heat from the sky and keeps the inside of the car warmer than the outside air. ,3
140326,Since the car has been parked in the sun for a while it has trapped heat causing it to be warmer than the outside. ,3
139543,This is because since the car has its own atmosphere due to its materials and locked circulation if its cold outside the cold would be trapped inside the car.,2
139534,"The air is warmer because the air inside the car is in an enclosed area, and so the heat has nowhere to escape or only less heat is escaping.",3
139861,The car is enclosing the air already in there so it is protected and sealed from the cold wind. So the warm air just keeps on circulating in the enclosed space of the car. Also all the glass windows allows the light to come in and heat it up.,4
139544,The inside of the car would be warmer than the outside air because the warm air released from the sun gets trapped inside the car and stays circulating around the car.,3
139864,the car is an insulator so it keeps heat trapped in the car,3
139542,The car's windows would trap heat from the sun and keep it inside. Even if it's cold outside a car is mostly insulated so it would be warmer inside that outside. ,2
139479,The car acts as a greenhouse. Solar radiation enters the car through the windows and the material inside the car will turn that into heat. Infrared radiation released from the material inside the car will stay in the car because it cannot leave through the windows.,5
139477,"The temperature of the inside of Akbar's car is warmer because the heat has been trapped inside from it being parked in the sun. Radiation enters the car, but it gets trapped like the greenhouse effect and heat stays in. Also with the dark car, it absorbs light even more.",4
139501,,1
139485,,1
139515,The air inside the car is warmer than the outside air because the outside air is affected by convection currents which cools it. ,2
139514,The sun's infrared energy is trapped by the car's windows.,4
139509,There are heat trapped in the car because the glass traps the heat in the car.,3
139507,"Even though it is cold outside, the light from the sun travels through the windows and the windshield and that converts into heat. Since the windows and doors and probably closed, much of the heat is retained, keeping the inside of the car warmer than the outside air.",4
139510,The heat is trapped inside the car from sitting in the sunlight.,3
139835,The air inside of the car will be warmer than the air outside because it is trapped inside with causes convection and conduction to occur.,3
139517,"The heat from the sun is retained inside the car and is not let out for a week, making the car warm inside.",2
139521,"The car has glass that is similar to the atmosphere. The solar radiation is able to go through the glass and stored as heat in the car, and the infrared radiation is reflect back to the car and covert back to heat. This allow the car to store heat inside, and have a warmer temperature than the outside air.",5
139526,The temperature inside the car will be warmer than the temperature outside because the inside of the car is like an insulator and the there is sunlight being directed at the car. The solar radiation will turn into heat as it enters through the glass windshield,4
139511,"Because the car is made out of metal and being exposed to the cold outside air, which cause the car to be cold, and so is the inside of the car. ",2
139506,"Since the car is in the sun all the heat gets absorbed into the car, and heat gets trapped so it allows it to be a really high temperature.",3
139863,The cars windows would trap heat inside the car thus keeping the temperature inside the car warmer than the temperature on the outside. ,3
139540,"The air inside a car is warmer than the outside air, because its in a closed environment, when it absorbs heat from the outside, the air would trap in the car. It would not escape anywhere.",3
139866,"The infrared radiation that has entered the car will be harder to escape. Once the infrared radiation is in the car, it will take a while to release.",3
139539,It is warmer inside a car than the outside air because heat is being trapped in the inside the car but infrared light is not let out. Hot air and Cold air is trapped inside in a process called convection. cold air is going down and hot air is rising.,4
139823,"Overtime, the car traps the heat absorbed from the Sun, therefore increasing the heat inside.",3
139535,"The space in the car will be warmer because the radiation will convert into heat and be detained in the car, collecting heat until the air inside is warmer than the air outside.",5
139862,"The heat is trapped inside of the vehicle and the sun is going into the car, while the heat does not escape the vehicle easily, this increases the heat of inside the car.",3
139537,"Because inside the car, the air is trapped and cool air does not go inside the car. The mirrors of the car is like the object that heats up the air because the Infrared Radiation that bouncing back from the surface inside of the car gets reflected back to the interior of the car again causing more heat to be transferred to the air. ",4
139832,"Since the car has been in the sun for a longer period of time, the heat will be trapped in and will take longer to adjust to the outside temperature.",3
139523,The car would be warmer than the outside air because the car is parked outside in the sun where the solar radiation will hit the car through the glass windows and changing into heat and can not escape because the glass reflects the heat energy back. In addition the air inside the car is a good insulator where it does not lose the heat at a fast rate.,5
139833,"The radiation from the sun will be trapped inside the car so even if it's a cold day, the inside of the car will still be warm. ",4
139519,"The car is warmer because the car is under direct sunlight, so the car is receiving solar radiation that passes through its windows. Since the windows are glass, it provides great insulation so that the solar radiation that has been converted into heat can not escape. So overtime, the car will slowly heat up.",5
139505,"Since the car has not been driven for a week and has been sitting in cold temperature for a long period of time, the car will reach equilibrium with the cold air.",2
139483,"The temperature will be the same because hot air that was trapped inside the car will eventually travel to the outside air because hot/warm air travels to the cooler temperatures. Thus, the hot air in the car will eventually reach equilibrium. ",2
139496,The inside of the car would be colder because it is a cold day. The cold air is seeping into the car and the coldness is being trapped inside. ,2
139489,If a car is hotter than it is on the outside on a hot day then it must be warmer than the outside air on a cold day because the car acts as a greenhouse and is able to trap heat.,3
139494,It is colder because the environment inside the car keeps in the temperature and stores the coldness inside the car while the outside temperature slowly changes.,2
139518,The temperature of the air inside the car will be warmer than outside air because the windows allow heat Energy to enter the car but doesn't allow in the heat to escape.,4
139525,The temperature of the inside the car will be warmer than the outside air because the car's materials serve as an insulator for the heat inside the air inside the car.,2
139520,The temperature of the air inside the car is warmer than the outside air because there is no convection occurring but radiation transfers heat into the car and is trapped inside the car.,4
139527,The window allows heat energy to enter the car and doesn't allow it to escape.,4
139508,"The infrared radiation from the sun enters the interior of the car through the windows of the car and the thickness of shell of the car and its windows helps trap the infrared radiation inside the car. The thickness of the shell and windows also restricts cold air from entering the inside of the car, so equilibrium will not be reached.",4
139524,The greenhouse effect will cause the car to be warmer than the outside. ,2
139528,,1
139522,It is warmer than the outside air because the car just sits there and heat is being absorbed and trap into the car.,3
139824,The car has different materials so the cold air outside will be trapped into the car.,2
139482,The windows allow the sunlight to get in the car while it traps heat in the car. The air is an isolated from the outside so the air inside would be warmer than the surrounding ,4
139480,The energy from solar radiation has been trapped in the car from the days where it has been sunny and has not escaped the car. So the car will be warmer than the outside air. ,4
139828,It is colder because the environment inside the car retains the temperature and stores the coldness inside the car while the outside temperature changes slowly.,2
139492,The glass from the windows of the car traps heat inside the car which makes it warmer than the outside air.,3
139829,It was left in the sun for awhile and the material the car is made up should have increased the temperature. ,2
139481,As his car is parked in the sun radiation is traveling inside through the car creating heat energy and is being trapped in there and is increasing for how ever long Akbar has left it there.,4
139827,the sun is reflectiing into the car and the heat is not escaping ,3
139800,"The temperature of the air inside the car is is warmer because solar radiation given from the sun was converted to heat energy, it has been in the car for such a long time that it has been kept there.",4
139488,"It should be warmer inside the car because like the solar oven, the car should retain some of the the heat that enters the car.",3
139495,The car is an insulator where the convection inside the car keeps the car cool.,2
139785,"The air trapped in the car does not escape and reach equilibrium with the air outside, but instead it is warmer than the air outside because the heat is trapped in the car.",2
139769,Since the car has been outside for a week the temperature transfer would have reached and equilibrium.,2
139819,"It would normally be colder than the outside air, but since its out in the sun, it'll cancel the coldness out. ",2
139796,,1
139803,,1
139643,The inside of the car will be warmer because the energy from the sun will become trapped inside the car due to the glass windows. ,4
139802,Metal is a good conductor so inside the car it would be warm but it will release quicker.,2
139842,Because inside of the car have different material like a car seat and radio and etc,2
139845,The air from outside is slowly transferring heat into the car.,2
139846,"The temperature of the air inside the car will be colder than the air outside because most of the heat is being transferred to the body of the car. In addition, the sun is hitting the outside of the car, creating a thin barrier between the inside of the car and the outside.",2
139561,Because the radiation from the sun can keep the car warm.,3
139798,It is warmer inside the car than outside because the heat has been inside the car for a long time.,2
139870,"Because the enclosed space inside a car is way smaller than the free world and with less space,it is easy to change the temperature.",2
139838,The air inside the car would be warmer because the sun is directly pointing at the car making the car warmer on the inside compared to the weather outside.,2
140093,because all that air that has been trapped in the car has not been exposed to the cold air so when you open your car it should feel warmer because it's been in the sun and not messed with for awhile,3
139840,"Because it has just been sitting there. Just because the sun out it won't make it warmer. SO lets say the windows frost up, so when the windows frost up that causes the cold air to get through and make it the same temperature as outside.",2
139875,It will be the same temperature as outside because even though it hasn't been moved for a week if he is getting in the car on a COLD day it should be the same because heat is going to be released faster since it wasn't under the sun anymore. ,2
139806,"I think the temperature of the air inside the car is warmer than the outside, because the car is a closed space, and the car windows is a good insulator, which can trap the heat inside the car.",3
139856,Colder because it has not been used for a week. A car usually needs to be warmed up when started.,2
139841,Air is a good insulator which means the sun would cause it to heat up and it would stay hot even though the weather is cold,2
139822,Air has been compacted and radiation may occur due to the sun.,3
139737,Colder because all the cold outside the car went inside the car and it trapped.,2
139853,The temperature inside is hotter because the sun heat is trapped inside the car and there is not windows for the heat to go so heat keeps getting in and increasing temp.,2
139775,The warm sun rays get trapped in the car which causes it to be warmer than the outside air. ,3
139851,,1
139847,,1
139747,Akbar's car acts as an insulator which contains cold and heat inside the car got absorb by the cold air from the outside of the car.,2
139843,,1
139739,"The weather of being inside of a car is warmer because of the radiation that goes on inside, which heats up the car itself and makes the heat warmer.",3
139848,,1
139849,,1
139879,Because it was parked in the sun the ray's of the sun were able to heat the inside of the car using radiation.,3
139876,"The temperature of the air inside the car is exactly the same than the outside air because the cold air will outside is absorbed by the car, therefore the coldness stays inside.",2
139877,The radiations from the sun gets trapped in the car making the air in the car to feel warmer than outside.,4
139881,,1
139869,"Since the car has been sitting outside for a week without driving it, it'd feel warmer than the outside.",2
139874,The car will trap in the heat so it would be warmer then the outside.,3
139867,"The heat would be trapped inside that's coming from the sun, just like the atmosphere traps heat to the earth.",3
139873,The heat has been trapped inside like how the atmosphere traps heat to the earth,3
139839,Its cold outside so if you enter the car it would be warmer. ,2
139882,,1
139768,the heat builds up inside the car very quickly with how closed and dark car interiors are,2
139880,,1
139878,,1
139854,,1
139809,The sunlight goes in the car and heats up through radiation,3
139814,I think the air inside the car will be warmer than the outside air because the car has been parked in the sun receiving some heat.,2
139795,,1
139816,,1
139812,"The car will absorb the heat from the objects thats inside of the car already, so it holds its own heat... ",2
139782,It would be much warmer than the outside air because if you leave a car outside and the sun is pointing towards it the car would absorb the heat. ,2
140712,I feel that it would be warmer because the car was sitting for a while week that there was probably still be trapped in the car. ,2
139529,i think it will be warmer because it was being park in the sun,2
139801,"The sun uses its radiation to hit the car, this then allows conduction to heat up the car inside, and finally convection spreads throughout the car making it hot.",3
139774,If you haven't driven for a week and its been in the sun for a whole week of course the inside will be hot. Cause all the heat of the sun makes everything inside burn you or will make your food poison if u left any food in that whole week.,2
139790,"the sun is still giving heat, but maybe the cold is coming from the breeze and the breeze does not go inside the car so then the car is still warmer than the outside air.",2
139855,"The temperature will be exactly the same as the outside air because they are at the same temperature, there are no more heat transfers",2
139778,,1
139808,,1
139797,,1
139815,"Because the glass and body of the car, insulates some heat. ",2
139817,the car has been left in sun for a week untouched so the air inside the car will be hotter than the cold air that is out side his car.,2
139787,it would be the same cause cold would remove the heat from the car,2
139799,It's warmer than the outside air because the hot air from outside got trapped inside of the car.,3
139785,"The car is completely closed for a week and because of that, heat from the sun is completely trapped in the car. Equilibrium can not be achieved because of the fact that convection did not occur since the car is completely shut and the heat from the outside is not able to change the heat in the inside.",2
139845,"when the door is close, oxygen can't get in, so it will make the temperature warmer.",2
140093,It should be warmer because it's been sitting in the sun for awhile and all of the suns energy that has been hitting the car is stuck inside of the car. Also because the car hasn't been moving or anything so the air conditioning or anything has been turned on in order to make it cooler than the outside air.,3
139808,The car will be warmer than the air outside because the is pretty much made from plastic and because its plastic it will transfer heat slower than metal will. ,2
139816,"Most cars are metal, the cold air coming in contact with the car's temperature meets equilibrium with the temperature outside. Eventually the temp of the car will effect the temp inside, with the help of the glass windows and sealed doors, the cold air doesn't leave the car.",2
139819,"Even if it was sitting outside the sun for a long period of time, it was sitting out on a cold day, meaning that it would be cold despite absorbing all that heat",2
139782,I think that it would be the same because the temperature would even out with the outside and inside of the car.,2
139787,the same cause the temp will even out over time,2
139769,The heat going into the car will stay and not leave as fast as it would through air.,3
139809,Light enters the car and is absorbed as heat in the cars inner surfaces,3
139556,The heat cannot escape from the car so the heat stays inside and stays warm.,3
139812,the heat cannot escape from the car so the heat stays inside and stays warm.,3
139529,it will be warmer cause it was parking in the sun,2
139815,"The car retains some heat, since it is enclosed.",3
139817,the heat for the past week been hitting his car so the air that is inside is warm and the air outside is cold,2
139806,"Because the sunlight passes through the glass and turn to heat, and also glass is a good insulator, which can trap the heat inside the car.",5
139561,"The heat is trapped inside the car since car is made of metal, it's going to absorb heat and gets trapped.",3
139841,Because the inside of the car would trap the sunlight in and warm up the inside.,4
139775,"Because the air outside is colder than the heat emitted into the car, the car is colder than the outside air. ",2
139844,The sun will heat up the inside of the car and the temperature will be warmer because the car windows are trapping the heat inside.,3
139856,"The temperature of the air inside the car would be warmer than the outside air because the car is parked in the sun; therefore, the car is absorbing the sun's heat.",2
139840,It will be the same because it has been sitting there and as the it sits there inside his car will be the same temperature.,2
139875,The heat isn't going to be sealed in the car once you get in so after the cold day all the heat is going to be gone even if it sat under the sun for a whole week.Heat is released and not kept.,2
139839,The temp inside the car will be warmer than the outside air because of the greenhouse effect. Since the glass of the car is transparent more energy is absorbed from the sun causing it to be warmer. ,4
139768,"cars are usually dark inside and could have the heater be lingering from it being last used, and that it absorbs the sunlight it can get",3
139855,"The temperature of the air inside the car will be exactly the same as the outside air because our body doesn't feel temperature, we feel it when heat enters or leaves the body.",2
139778,The car is placed outdoors causing the heat of the car and the air to mix causing the temperature to be the same.,2
139811,I predict the temperature to be warmer than the outside air because the heat will be trapped inside of the car. ,3
139801,Convection will heat up the car from conduction and the conduction is caused by radiation.,3
139803,"Even if its a cold day, there is still sun shining on the car which heat can go in and because the car has no opening the heat will also be trapped inside which will cause the temperature of the air insdie the car to be warmer than the outside air.",3
139813,It would be warmer because of the heat trapped inside of the car. ,3
139790,The sun radiated to the inside of the car and the car kept the heat.,4
139797,The temperature inside the car will be warmer than the air outside of the car because the air is being trapped inside the car therefore it will just increase in heat accordingly towards the temperature outside of the car. ,3
139814,The temperature of the air inside the car is warmer than the outside air because car has been outside in the sun receiving heat.,2
139810,,1
139795,The temperature of the air inside the car is warmer because the air from the outside can't really go inside the car because the windows are closed or it depends if the windows are open or not.,2
139796,The heat inside the car has no way out.,3
139798,"Since the heat was trapped inside the car, it will feel hotter inside than the air outside.",3
139842,Because of the glass of the car will increase the heat whenever it goes thru the glass. ,2
139818,The inside would be warmer because sunlight would be trapped inside which would heat up the inside.,4
139643,"The solar radiation from the sun enters the car and becomes heat which is trapped by the glass, thus the inside will be warmer.",5
139850,it would be colder because it would be colder outside to start with and nobody has entered in the car aswell making it cold as days pass,2
139802,Its been sitting in the sun for a week and so the car will absorb the heat and trap it in the car.,3
139843,Equilibrium makes both inside of the car and outside the same temperature even though one feels colder than the other.,2
139849,the car is a smaller area that conducts more heat,2
139870,the temperature will be hotter because it is a smaller space and all of the heat inside gets trapped in it.,3
139881,warmer because it had been parked in the sun and the cold temperature is not going inside the car.,2
139876,The air inside the car is warmer than the air outside of the car because the heat is being absorbed by the car. ,2
139878,it's warmer because the air has been stuck inside the car.,3
139838,The car has a smaller space which makes it easier to trap in heat especially if the sun is directed at the parked car.,3
139880,I think that is going to be warmer than the outside air because the car was parked in the sun for a week so the air got hot inside the car.,3
139871,"The heat from the sun, it contract the heat to inside the car.",2
139882,The car had been parked in the sun for a week which means the doors or windows weren't open for the car to cool off.,2
139869,"I think it'd be warmer than the outside, because the car is a closed space which leaves the temperature to scatter.",2
139847,Presumably with the windows closed the energy is being retained within the car because its a closed system their isn't any opening for heat to escape from the car.,4
139879,,1
139853,It's warmer because it attracts heat so heat will be trapped inside. ,2
139747,I think it would be the same because it has been a week already and it must have reached equilibrium temp. already.,2
139774,It will feel exactly the same as the outside air because our body does not feel the temperature. ,2
153977,"If the doors have been shut, then the temp. should be the same because the temp. does NOT transfer into the car. One more thing is that if it was one cold day, it would be warmer.",2
153978,"Whenever it's really cold and you haven't been in the car, it starts to get really cold. For example, on cold mornings when I get in the car it's much colder than it is outside.",2
153979,"It would be the same air outside because, as the cold air is building up in the car, the carbon dioxide is braking down the cold air.So that maks it the same air pressure as out side but because its so cold the car might have trouble working.",2
153980,the metal heats up from the sun.,2
153981,"I am guessing the car is going to be colder just because from past experiences I have gotten into a car in the sun on a cold morning before, and it has been slightly colder than outside. In this case Akbar hasn't been in his car causing it to be colder because of the lack of body heat.",2
153982,In my moms car the heat is always on on a cold days and the cool air is on when it is hot outside.,2
153983,it is warmer than outside because the heat is beaming on the car all day so then the hole car will suck in the heat and the car will stay hot.,2
153984,his car will be hot because since the car is made out of metal metal sucks in heat and makes his car warmer.,2
153985,"I predict it will be warmer than the outside because, it has been sitting in the sun for a week. Also it will be hot because, he hasn't turned on the air conditioner in a week to cool the car down.",2
153987,I think a car is warmer becuse the sun face the glass on a car and that is how it keeps it warm.,2
153988,well i think that it would be warmer than outside because the air is stuck inside so after a while it builds up and makes it warmer . i also think it is warmer because the sun gliming on top of it making the car get hotter than before,2
153989,"because it's park in the sun and it hasn't been driven for a week all the hot air is still in the car, so the car is warmer.",2
153990,I think that his car would be colder because it was cold outside and he also has not driven his car in a week and his car kept the cold trapped inside the car.,2
153991,From experience the materials the car is made with held in the heat and the heat that came in causing the air inside the car to be hotter than the air around the car.,2
153992,Cause my moms car is the same temp. in outside,2
153994,"If the sun is shining for a week on a car, the heat will probably get trapped in the car. (it would be muggy or moist in",3
153995,The temperature is warmer inside of the car than outside because all the air is building up in the car and the doors aren't being opened.,2
153996,I think it is colder then outside because whenever my mom doesn't use her car for a very long time it colder than outside but she does close the window.,2
153997,it will be colder on the outside because it is parked in the sun but it is cold.,2
153999,I know this becuse the sun is hot and when the sun hits the the car the car gets really heated and on that day It is cold but the heat is trapped inside.,3
154000,I think that it would be hotter because it's in the sun and the sun's rays are coming down on it and the heat is most likely going to stay in the car,3
154026,"I think this because the heat will get trapped in the car, and it can't escape. Since, the heat is trapped in the car, It will be warmer than the outside air.",3
154042,because  if the air is cold outside it will some how get in side the car and just cuz the sun is shining on the car does not mean enything because the cold air can go out side and inside to.,2
154107,"I think it's colder than the outside air because its been there for a week day and night. Also, weather changes over night so that is why I think the car is colder that the out side air.",2
154108,"I believe the the air in the car will be warmer than the weather currently outside because when he last left the car, the sun sent heat waves that got inside the car. Then, after the week goes by, the warm air will still be in there and therefore the air inside the car is warm.",3
154109,"I think the air in the car is warmer than outside because even though it is a cold day if you park a car in the sun usually heats the car up. For example, one day in fall my dad and I were going into a store. So we found a parking spot right in the sun and when we came back out from the store the air in the car was almost 80 degrees and it was only 60 outside.",2
154111,I think that the car would be the same air as the outside because the temperature of the outside air is stronger than the temperature of the sun on the car.,2
154113,I think the air on the inside would be warm then the air on the inside then the outside because all of the heat would have stored up in the car and only a little bit of cold air would have been let into the car. Which would have made the inside of the car warmer then the outside of the car.,2
154114,I think that it would be warmer because if it was sunny the day he parked it the sun would be trapped in.If he didn't drive it for a week and the day he uses it its cold it would still be warm.,3
154115,I think this because the air inside usually is what the air is outside is but a little warmer or a little colder.,2
154117,I think that it will be the same because when it is cold and you are parked in the sun  it could get cold or hot it depends on the car you are in or driving.Also on hot days it would get hotter so on a cold day I think that it would not get colder but stay the same the same temperature.,2
154120,The car left in the sun for one week would leave the car warmer than the outside air because the car absorbed the heat from the sun and the car has not been expose to cold air for one week which leaves us to our answer the car has warmer air than outside.,3
154121,because when you go in a car its all heated up or its all ready warm.,2
154123,its colder inside because the cold air is covering the car so it we start to freeze inside and there less space so the cold air can travel around faster.,2
154125,warmer because the sun has been on the car.,2
154126,Because the suns Ray is in side the car which is heats up the air around it and the air is warmer then the air outside,4
154129,I think the air temperature inside the car is warm because if it were in the sun the whole time for  a week it would be warm. It would also depend on the car color inside and out because if it were black then it would bring sun's beams of heat to the car.If white or any other color it would bring as much heat as a black car. But the cold air might make it cooler because he just opened the car door and the car's air would mix with the cold and become cooler than it did before hand.,2
154131,"I think this because the car was outside for a week, and the sun could of sent heat waves and the heat could have been trapped in the car.",3
154133,Why it will be cold in the car because when he left the car in the coldness for a week the car gets colder by the day so when its thier for a week the car will be freezing the next time he goes in the car.,2
154136,If the car is in the sun and it has not bin riven for a week and it is a cold day it is going to be warm in side in the car.,2
154137,"I picked  Warmer than the outside air"" because when its very hot outside and the sun is hitting a car the inside of the car its very very hot. I also could of picked ""Exactly the same as the outside air"" because if the weather is very cold outside then the car is the same temperature as the outside.""",2
154138,because the sun is always on the sun for week and it was cold so it might be warmer inside the car than outside.Also the car is made of metal so than it gets hot .,2
154139,I think it is the same as outside because the air gets stuck in the car which  makes it cold.,2
154142,I think it's colder because even tho it's in the sun it's cold because it's cold out side and the car is parked in the sun but if it's cold then that means that the sun is not shining to bright to make the day hot so the car is going to be colder than outside.,2
154149,It would be colder because of the cars tiny cracks from the windows and the doors. Its colder cause when the air gets trapped in the car it goes through the windows and cant get out.,2
154154,I think the car would be warmer than the outside because the car has been siting in the sun for a week and has never been moved from the sun sense a week so the car would be super hot and out side would be warm.,2
154156,Because if it is cold outside and the car was at sun then the heat and the cold should mix together,2
154302,i think it will be warmer because it has been sitting in the sun for a week there is no way his car could be the same temperature as the air outside in one day of the week but again it did not say how hot or cold it was that week it could have been raining but the sun was shinning at the same time.,2
154303,"A car is warmer than outside air because since the car has been off for a while, during that time period, it has absorbed heat. Also, the car has not been moving so there is no circulation in the car to make it cooler. As well as the car trapping the absorbed heat because there is no patch for escape, therefor a car cannot be cooler than outside.",4
154304,I think it would be colder inside the car because if you havent driven the car for a week then it would be what ever tempiture it is outside.,2
154306,"If it was 20 to 30 degrees and sunny as the highest, the cold air would definitely affect the temperature to go down about 1-5 degrees. The sun however would bring the temperature up a little bit to make an exact temperature.",2
154308,the air will be warmer because the air inside is confined and there outsidse is not . The air is much more pressurized,2
154309,"I think this is the right answer because it was a cold day, BUT it was sitting in the sun for a week.So I must be some were in between so that's what I said.",2
154312,it would be exactly the same because the air could get in from under the car,2
154313,"Because if the car has been sitting in the sun for the length that it has been in that spot, its bound to be warmer than the air outside depending on the temperature inside the car (which is probably warmer) than the outside air unless the windows were open. In that case, the car would be the same temperature as the outside.",2
154314,The sun was keeping the inside of the car warm in the cold air while it has not been driven for a week.,2
154315,I think colder because when i get in the car when it is in the driveway it always feels colder than how it feels outside.,2
154316,I think this because since the car is metal it will heat up because of the sun also the probably has some sort of insulation to keep it warm.,2
154317,I think its exactly because if you have your window down then the air from outside comes in the car.,2
154320,"it will be than the outside air because even though it is it is in the sun it has not been driven in weeks resulting in the engine to some what freeze"" or not run properly  and because it is a cold morning it was most likely even colder the the night before which will most likely result in the week being of relatively cold weather. Most likely the car is not going to be significantly cold in the car it will still be colder to some degree""",2
154328,I got the answer by thinking if it's cold day outside but Akkbar parked it in the sun for a few weeks the medal must make it really hot on the inside of the car.,2
154331,It is warmer because if it was parked in the sun for a week the car from the inside will get hatter the longer it stays in the sun the warmer the car gets.,2
154332,"because,is goingto be""that same.",2
154333,I think that the car will be warmer than the air outside because the air inside the car is trapped inside and with the sun beating down for weeks and the parts inside the car like the seats and etc absorb the heat.,4
154334,becouse its locked and there is a heater,2
154338,"because,is going to be"" that same.",2
154339,I know the air is going to be colder than the outside air because I have been in a car the has been sitting in the cold so that's why I know how it will be in a car.,2
154340,It has been out side for week and it been hot the the week and now its cold the temperature will be the the same.,2
154341,I think this because the air conditioner in side the car can be on and out side it sunny.,2
154344,I think the temperature would be the same as the outside air because the air out side is cold and it makes the inside of the car also cold.,2
154347,it should be warmer inside the car because the doors should not be open and you can turn on the air and put it in to warm and not cold and you won't be cold inside of the car.,2
154378,because in the car don t have ever window open.,2
154704,"The question asks what the temperature of the car would be after a week, on a cold day, in the sun. Energy from the sun causes the car to heat up, even if it is cold everywhere else.",3
154846,I think the air outside will be warmer than the outside air because it had the sun going through the window for a week with all doors shut and no way of the hot air getting out,2
154847,I think this because if the car is parked in the sun for a week then the air inside would probobly be hot.,2
154848,i think so because of the facts that wen you touch a hot car wen it is hot it can bern your hand and also the facts that if you sit inside the car it will bern but i personly  beleve that it is not as hot is the thecar.,2
154914,"I think it is hotter because after sitting in the sun for a while, the inside of a car starts to get hot because the heat on the outside of the car can go away. However, the heat on the inside gets trapped inside the car.",3
154915,It would be hotter inside because it has not been driven in a week so the ac has not been on.,2
153978,"Whenever a car hasn't been driven for a long time, it gets really cold. For example, in the morning when I first get in the car that hasn't been driven all night, it's freezing.",2
153979,why is Akbar car warm let me tell you .Akbar's car has been in a sunny spot for a week so the heat build up.,2
153982,When it is hot outside inside the car is way hotter. I know this because on summer days my moms car is hot inside.,2
154914,"It is most likely warmer because the glass is letting heat inside but it doesn't let the heat out, like a solar oven.",3
153991,Heat in the car has been heating up for days.,2
154107,I think it is colder than the out side air because its been sitting there for the whole 5 nights and the car was not on. Also the heater hasn't been on so the car is defiantly not warm so that's why i think the car is colder than the outside air.,2
154117,I picked this answer because when it is cold outside but has been in the warm weather outside for a week it will be warmer because it is only that one day that it is cold and it has been warm for the whole week.,2
154126,Its warmer inside because the cold air can't get inside the car and the air inside is the same.,2
154111,I think this because the car has been out for days and the temperature outside was temporary.,2
154108,I believe the air inside the car is warmer than the outside air because the heat of when Akbar last left his car is still in there.,2
154133,It will be warmer or hotter because the radiation of the heat of the sun gets in the car and the heat makes the car get hot.,4
154113,Because the car would be like a big Solar Oven and all of the heat just stay in there. And everyday the car would just keep getting warmer and warmer and warmer it moves to a different place where it's not that warm.,3
154120,"If the car has been left in the sun for a week, the radiation from the sun would heat the car.",4
154137,The inside of the car will be cooler because when I experimented on the solar oven the light was very hot and the inside was cool and the temperature was at a lower degree. I think that Akbar's car will be cooler inside.,2
154154,I think it is hotter in the inside because the outside could be 84 deegres and the car can get up to 99 degrees that is why I think my answer is warmer than the outside air.,2
154114,It would be warmer than the outside because none of the hot air got out.,3
154121,because it will make solor heat waves,2
154131,I think this because it uses convection so the outside of the car would be cold so the inside would be colder because the metal would get cold and keep the car cold.,2
154125,because the car traps the heat.,3
154123,Because there less space in the car so the cold air can travel around faster and get the inside cold and the cold air gets trap inside.,2
154847,My answer is warmer than the outside air because if it was one cold day out of a week and the car was parked in the sun for a week then the car would propobly be very hot on the inside.,2
154313,Because usually the heat on the outside would transfer to the inside of the car.,2
154315,I think warmer than outside because when we tested our solar oven it was a little bit warmer than it was in the room.,2
154304,"i think this because the car will trap the cold inside the car, and keep the car cold.",2
154704,"After a week in the sun, the car is going to be warm, because the heat is trapped inside. On a cold day the outside temperature would be colder than the car heated up from trapped heat.",3
154303,"The car would be warmer than the outside air because even though outside is cold, the car was parked in the sun, which is a heat source. And the sun should heat up the car and the car despite it being cold outside.",2
154309,It is probably warmer because it has been sitting in the sun for a week and all the warmer air is trapped inside.,3
154316,Warmer because the car kept in the heat.,2
154312,I think it will be the same because the outside temperature could get into the car through the motor into the air conditioning thing.,2
154302,I think that his car will be hotter than the temature outside because it has been sitting there for a week not an hour or somenthing and the tempature changes every hour on the hour.,2
154314,"If the car was sitting in the sun, it must have been warmer than the outside air.",2
154317,Its colder inside because it said that its been parked in the sun.,2
154320,"I personally think that it will be warmer because, just like the solar ovens, the sun heats it up and not as much the outside air, even though it does have a large factor in the car heating up, I still think, if you think about it from a solar oven kind-of view, it makes sense that it would be warmer on the inside of the car other than the outside.",1
154344,I think this because the car is parked in the sun and is there for a long time so it would be colder than the outside air.,2
153997,If the car is parked in front of the sun the car will be hot but colder than the outside.,2
153989,I think this because it's bend sitting in the sun for a week so it's abosrt a lot of heat,3
154000,the heat from the sun gets in the car and gets trapped there so heat just builds up with more and more heat,3
153987,It also depending the whether outside.,2
153981,"Since the car hasn't been driven for a week, there is a lack of body heat inside the car. Also, the engine hasn't been running for a while, and that gives off heat to the car. Finally, I have evidence from my personal life. When I go on a week long trip to anywhere, I leave my car in a parking lot so that it doesn't get stolen. When my family and I get back from our trip, our car is cold even though it has been sitting in the sun all week just because it was a cold morning/night.",2
153980,The cold air is trapped inside the car and makes it colder and colder. Also I know from experience.,2
153996,The air in the car is colder than the air outside because the air outside observes the air inside.,2
154026,I think that it is warmer because the sun is getting soaked into the car to make it warm.,2
153984,because by then the car would have collected enough heat that it should be warmer than outside,2
153985,"I think it is colder, because the engine hasn't been heated by getting turned on. Also it is a cold day so the car will get colder than normal.",2
153999,Even though they have not used it in a week the heat is still trapped inside.,3
154138,Because the air stays in the car and it heats up.,2
154136,it is going to warm inside in side the car but cold inside,2
154115,"Warmer because the air outside is cold and the car hasn't been driven in a week, but the car is parked in the sun so in side to car is probably hotter that outside.",2
154142,I think i'ts warmer than the air outside because its in the sun and the sun has heat that goes inside the car and it makes it warmer.,2
154109,The car will be warmer then the outside air because if the sun is heating the car it is like a solar oven. So it will get hotter because of the metal.,2
154338,The answer that  we choose is  warmer than the outside air. Because  is like example when it's cold outside  sometimes it gets warmer inside the car.,2
154346,because the window are close and and the sun reflect on,2
154308,"Since the car is protected by the outer metal the car will be  warmer inside, like a house.",2
154306,The heat is being trapped inside from the last time he went inside his car. If his car color is black or a dark color the car woul,3
154331,I think it is warmer than the temperature outside because if it was not driven in a week then the temperature will have gone up and the car will be hotter than before because if it was parked in the sun it would have been hotter than when you drove it.,2
154333,The car will cool down on one cold day even when sitting outside for a week.,2
154341,because it cold outside and he has not driven it so it is probably cold inside the car.,2
154334,it is colder then out side becouse it has been there for a week and how many days are cold it adds up.,2
154340,the hot air stays in  the car so it gets hot,3
154339,Its going to be colder than the outside air because the car would start to get cold at night and in he morning since its been in the cold for a long time its going to be colder than the outside air since nothing was protecting the car.,2
154846,I think it will be warmer than the outside air because since it is cold outside it will not be hot inside the car but it will not be colder than the outside air and it will not be exactly the same because it has been sitting in the sun but not in hot air.,2
154149,It's because it collects the cold air from the outside and contains it inside.,2
154129,I think this because if it has been in the sun for a week it would get hot and if it were a cold day it  would be warm.,2
154848,it will most likey be worm inside than outside becuse it has an motter and some left over body heat.,2
154156,The car is at the sun and the sun gives the heat.,2
153995,"The temperature will be hotter inside of the car then outside because the car is sealed and not much air will get inside. But since there are windows, the solar radiation can enter.",3
154915,It would be warmer because it has been in the sun for a week and the cold has not got in yet.,2
153983,I say warmer than outside air because the heat can shine through the glass but will be harder to get out so when you get in most of the heat is trapped in and will be hotter.,3
153994,"Because the car was outside for so long, sun would shine rays into the car and the heat would get trapped in it.",4
153988,I remember one day i was walking to my car and it was cold outside and when i got in it was colder than outside and i think the cold air builds up to make it coldere than before,2
153993,It should be warmer because the doors are sealled.,2
153990,I think that the air would be hotter than the air outside because the car is made of metal and the hot air gets trapped outside.,2
154042,because if you go inside the car you can feel the cold air is the same of outside.,2
153992,cause that happens to my mom.,2
153977,"If the heat will shine on the car and it will not be driven for a week, then it will rise because radiation rays will flow onto the car and it will make the car warmer than the air is outside of the car.",3
153816,"The metallic surface absorbs the sun's rays, warming up the car. It does not matter if it is a cold day. The only exception is if the windows are open, or the color of the interior, but assuming all windows are closed and the inside is tan, the inside will still be warmer.",4
153818,"The temperature of the day will be the temperature of the car with no outside factors. However, the sun will heat the car and the air in the faster than the sun can heat the entire atmosphere of the Earth. Therefore, the air inside the car will be hotter than outside.

The question below doesn't make very much sense. How would I know what affected the cars temperature the most? The answer is obviously(to me) either the sun or the air outside the car, but I have now idea which.

It's hard for me to explain something like this. So much goes on in my brain thinking through the problem. So I can't put everything I think of, and so if I jump around in my answer, that would be why.",2
153822,if its a cold day its most likely been a coldd week so therefor the car woul be colder,2
153823,Because the sun will heat up the car.,2
153824,"Because cold air is hitting the frame of the car, the inside is surrounded by cold metal, making the atmosphere of the inside cold.",2
153826,It has probably been cold out for about a week so it would be cold in the car.,2
153827,if it was parked out side in the SUN the inside of the car would be warm because if cold air is pushing on he car the amount of energy put in to that would make the inside of the car warm.,3
153830,"The sun is hitting the car which warms up the inside because the windows allow sunlight to pass through the car into the inside of it, causing the heat to stay inside the car. Also, if the car has black seats (not saying that it does) it will absorb the heat from the sunlight which is another way that the car could stay warmer than the outside air.",5
153831,I think that it will be the same because the car is in the sun but it is a cold day.,2
153832,"When you turn on the car the heater heats the inside of the car, so dos the engine wen it burns gas.",2
153834,"Even though there's sun heating the car, the cold air cools it at the same time.",2
153835,"I think that the air inside the car would be colder than the air outside because the engine has not been run for the whole week, meaning that the air inside the car has to be cold.",2
153836,The car was hot because all the heat from the sun got in the car and cannot get out.,3
153837,I think the car is colder than the outside because if it's a cold day and the car hasn't been driven for a week the engine would be at a freezing temperature and the only heat it would get would be the little amount of sunlight there is on a cold day.,3
153838,It's warmer than outside air because the temperature in the car as differnt air than the outside air.,2
153839,The car will be colder than the outside air because it hasn't been driven for a week and the car wouldn't be effected by the sun. Also the ca hasn't been run on is engine. So the car wouldn't be as warm than it is outside.,2
153843,it is warmer because all of the heat from the sun got in the car and cannot get out,3
153844,If he has parked his car in the sun and left it there for a week then the inside of the car is going to be more warm than outside because the inside of the car is usually more warm and i has been left there for a long time in the sun so it should be more warm.,2
153845,"I think that it would be warmer inside the car because it was parked in the sun.
And the heat was hitting the vehicle for a week.",2
153848,I think it will be warmer because today is the only cold day. The other days could have been hot days.,2
153852,"I chose the 2nd answer, because the car was in front of the sun, and made the car warm inside.",2
153854,Akbar car has been not driven for a week so his car has adated  to the tempeter .,2
153856,"In my opinion the temperature in the car will be the same exact as the outside air ,because the temperature outside air will cause the car inside.For example if its a hot day then the car inside air  will be hot inside.",2
153859,It is warmer than the outside air because it was wating i,2
153860,The car has been under the sun for a week so it will be warmer than outside,2
153863,The air inside the car is warmer than the air outside because the air outside the car has not quite hit the inside air but since the outside of the car makes the car colder but it is in between.,2
153864,It's going to be a different temperature inside the car as the compared  outside because in the car it will keep all the warm air inside.,3
153865,"I think the inside of his car would be warmer than the outside air because cars keep in heat using insulation, making it warmer than the cold outside air. Also, the sun heats up the car, giving it a heat bonus.",3
153905,"The air inside the car has been trapped in a metal box (which would make air warmer in the car) and since it is cold outside, that would make the air even warmer in comparison.",2
153906,"I think this because, it doesn't matter about how hot it was, it matters on how cold it was during the night and other days it was cold.",2
153908,"I think it would be warmer because, the car is  a container to the air so there would be no fresh air. That would cause the air to get stuffy and warm.",2
153909,Sense the car has been sitting in the sun the car starts to heat up sense thr metal atracts the sun.The color of the car also matters because darker colors like black atractt more sun but lighter colors atractt less sun.,3
153910,I have experienced this before so I know if it's hot outside then it's most likely to be hot inside and the same thing happens with cold weather.,2
153911,I've had experience like this it was a Saturday morning and the air was cold but hen i got inside the car it was way colder then the outside air,2
153913,The temperature is warmer because the car isn't the same as outside air it a little warmer cause the car's energy.,2
153914,"Well, if it is cold outside, and the ca hasn't been driven for a week, it is probably colder inside the car. I mainly guessed on this, but usually when it's cold outside and I go in the car, it's colder in the car than it is outide.",2
153915,cause the sun was warm inside the car but outside it was cold,2
153916,"I think this because if it is cold then in the car it will be warmer because none of the cold air can get in. If it is hot, then it will be hotter in the car because the car is made of metal and metal can absorb heat.",2
153917,I think  that  because it is hot  and it has been siting there for a week,2
153918,since were making solar OVENS I would think the temperature is warmer .,2
153919,I think that it would be the same because the air would have gotten into the car and because the engine has not been ran so the car's air wouldn't have risen and the sun would have only made the car hot but not the air.,2
153921,I think it would be warmer because it was parked in the sun and the heat from the sun would heat up he car so when you go into it it would be warmer then it was outside.,3
153922,if you have not driven your car for a couple days and its winter its colder than the outside air. And if it is summer and you have not driven your car for a couple of days its hotter than the outside air.,2
153923,I think it will be warmer than the air outside because the air will stay inside and the heat from the sun will warm up the air inside and will cause the air inside to be warmer than the air outside.,3
153924,because if its cold out side wear in the car it is hot that would be because there no open air,2
153926,It will be warmer inside because even though its a cold day and its cold outside the sun is shining on the car and makes it warmer.,2
153927,it is exactly the same as the outside air because  when the cold air goes in side the car the air goes in all the spaces and evaporates and levas the rest of the cold air there.,2
153928,"Well, I used my logic to find out if its has not been run for a week the car its probably cold inside.",2
153929,The sun has been on the car so it will heat up.,2
153930,One time when my dad left his car outside and we got in it and it was colder than the air outside and thats why I chose this as my awnser.,2
153931,well in car its warmer than outside because the wind isnt  blowing inside the car but outside the wind is blowing at you and you dont have any protection,2
153932,the car s cold because,2
153933,One day my dad left his car out in the cold in San Francisco and when we went into the car it was colder than the outside air. I think that it would also be colder because it is a closed area of space that has no heat and it would just keep getting colder and colder.,2
153934,pues  tinece  estar  adendo,2
153935,"I got warmer because it may have been a cold day when he parked his car, but when you leave a car in a sunny spot for a whole week the car is probably going to have a very high temperature.",2
153936,my answer is warmer than the outside air becouse it said akbar walks to the car and it said it cold outside and the is parked in the sun so it hot,2
154112,I think this because it has some body heat from when the person last left the car. I also think this because my moms car gets warm when she does not drive it for a long time.,2
154118,on a cold day when I leave my car for 5 min. and come back it is more cold.,2
154119,It will be warmer because it was in the sun. When you are not driving the car will absorb heat or coldness depending on the weather. In this case it was in the sun so it is much warmer.,2
154122,"When the Outside air for example 80 degrees, it would be hotter but when its cold like 30 degrees t would be cooler.",2
154124,"The air is trapped in the car for so long, so the air is warmer.",2
154127,It is colder because the sun heats the air outside the car while there is no sun in the car. The car is sealed tight keeping all the air sealed tight inside and not letting any air slip out of it. There is no heat source therefore keeping it cold.,2
154128,I think it will be hotter because it is sealed and it is in the sun so the cold air can't mix with the hot air in the car.,2
154130,It's is colder because the air can go through the widow and cold get in.,2
154132,body heat is preserved in the car space,2
154134,It would be warmer because the air is trapped inside the car and it can't have any contact with the cold outside air.,2
154135,I think the air in the car will be warmer than the outside air because it has been outside and there is no where for the air t go so it starts getting warmer because of the sun heating up the car with the air trapped in side.,3
154141,Its exactly the same as the outside air because the air outside either cools the inside or that warms the car.,2
154143,If the air outside warm or cold the tempature of the car changes because of the moisture or heat.,2
154145,If the car has not been driven in a week and that day its cold but the car is in the sun it will still be cold inside because the sun isn't completely out yet,2
154146,"If it is cold outside in the morning but it is parked in the sun it doesn't really matter because the same thing happens to my dads truck, and when it is hot it gets hot                inside my dads truck.",2
154147,The car is not the same temperature than the outside because it tracks more heat since it has more stuff inside if it.,2
154148,"Because since the car has walls around it, it wouldn't be freezing like out side because the cold air can barely find a way in the car. But if the week has a hot day the heat can easly go into the metal and for the cold  can only go on the metal from the out side.",2
154150,it is cold or hot but inside the car it is cold because cold air goes inside the car.,2
154152,I know that it would be warmer because all the hot air is going inside for a week  and none of the air is coming out and just some of the seats stay warm.,3
154153,Because the car changes every time the temperature changes.,2
154157,I think the car  will be warmer than the outside air.I think it will be warmer than the outside air because It been In the sun  for a week  and if it stays there for a week in the sun it's going to be warmer.,2
154159,This happened to my mom's car,2
154160,I think the car is warmer than the outside air because it said that it stayed in the sun all week.,2
154161,The reason that I picked the answer:Colder than the outside air because it happened before to my moms car and it was really colder than the outside air.,2
154162,it would be warmer in the car because the cold air cant get in the car so it would be warm.,2
154163,It a very,2
154193,If the the day is cold and it is parked in the sun the sun won't effect the car since the air is cold.,2
154194,"The car is getting heat even though the air is a bit cold. Also,we don't know the temperature for the other days. I could have been blazing hot the rest of the week. Finally, whatever the temperature it is the sun. The sun creates energy which produces heat and Akbar's car is in the sun so the heat would make the car hotter. This is why I think the car would be hotter.",4
154195,"The Greenhouse Affect took place in this example. This is when warm energy enters a container and it's hard for it to leave, so the container heat up. (I think.)",3
154196,I think this because the air from the outside will go through the vents and stay in the car.,2
154197,"The car would have been exactly the same because even though it was in the sun, the cold would have also affected the inside and outside.",2
154198,i think that if it has been in the sun for a week and drives it on a cold day the car will be still be getting colder,2
154199,If a car is standing in the sun the car would get heated up inside.,2
154200,it will be cold cause air gets in the car but not out so the air is just storaged in the car,2
154201,If Akbar left his car in the heat for the whole week it would be exactly the same because thee heat will effect the car and will be really hot.,2
154202,"His car would be warmer because the sun has been beating down on his car for a week, and he hasn't moved it. the car would have to be warm at least.",2
154204,It is warmer then the outside because you can change the temperature.,2
154205,I believe the car will have warmer air then the outside air because the car hasn't been driven for a week. When the car isn't driven the motor makes the car more warm.,2
154206,The air inside the car will be warmer than the air outside because when he left the car warm air settled and would't be able to escape and would become warmer even when the temperature outside the car changed.,2
154208,The sunlight would have heated the car because he material of the car wold have become very hot.,3
154210,"It will be warmer than the outside air because the car has been in the sun. The car has also not been driven for a week so, for a week the car has been in the sun baking.",2
154211,It would be the exact same because if his car was in the sun on a cold day his car would be the same as the outside air because it was cold then the sun was on it so it evened it out.,2
154212,i would think it would warmer inside the car because it has been sitting in the sun for a whole week.It also has not been driven in a whole week.,2
154214,I got my answer because in the word problem it says the car is parked in the sun for a week.,2
154215,it is warm inside the car because warm air is trapped inside the car and no windows are open.,3
154216,If his car is parked in the sun the air is still cold the inside of hi car could be hot.,2
154218,Well sense the car has been sitting in hot sun for a week it probably really warm.,2
154219,,1
154220,well if he left his car parked in the sun for a week it will be warmer inside than outside,2
154221,the sun would warm up the inside of the car.,2
154224,Cold because he has not warmed up the car.,2
154225,becuse it is cold out side  and the car has a heter,2
154226,The car is in the sun so it is going to be warmer,2
154228,Because if you leave in the sun it will get warmer then the temperature of the air outside.,2
154307,I think that the car would be warmer than then the outside air because if the car was outside for a week in the sun and that the car was not turned on then is was most likely hot.,2
154310,Its going to be warmer than the outside air because the sun makes the car moisturize.,2
154311,When the sun shines the car it get warmer because of the window the light gets hoter,3
154318,I think that it is colder than outside air because it is cold in Akar it is cold and inside the car it is cold even though the sun it hitting the car.,2
154319,I believe this because if a car has windows the sunlight is heating the window and when the sunlight goes into the car the air is being warmed up like how you can make a fire with light and a magnifiying glass. That is why I believe the car would be warmer on the inside then the outside.,3
154321,I think the car is warmer then the outside air because it is parked in the sun and has not been driven for a week. If the tempature outside is cold and the car is parked in the sun the car will be warmer than the outside air.,2
154322,I chose warmer than the outside air because if it is cold outside but he is parked in the sun the car is going to get heat from the sun and it is ging to get into the car but the outside air is still cold which makes in warmer in the car.,2
154323,"I chose this because, it depends if you run the air.",2
154324,"If the car is parked in the sun on a cold day, the sun is beating down on the car which warms it up and the air outside is cold.",3
154325,"It will be hotter than outside because during that week it had been sitting in the sun, heat gets builds up in the car and there is no way for it to leave, so it stays inside the car until it is driven or Akbar opens the windows for a certain amount of time.",3
154326,Cars have an a.c.,2
154327,"Since it has been under the sun for  a week, it should be warmer than the cold day.",2
154329,Because if the sun is shining in the car and its cold outside it would maybe the exact weather.,2
154330,"because, the car is always warmer than outside because it is a closed area.",2
154335,"I think its warmer than the out side because you may have some foarm of heat on and that will help, pluss he sun can hit te glass and will go in the car but the heat can not ger out.",3
154336,becuse it dosent matter the tempiture of the last days it matters of this day and it was hot so the car is hot if its in the sun if is not then its cold,2
154337,It was was very cold. Then it was in the sun for a week. Then if it was cold and it sat in the hot sun for a week it is should probably be warmer from all the hot temperature.,2
154342,It would be that way because it is a cold day and the car has not been driven in 1 week.,2
154343,i think it would colder because the car is sealed and its small space,2
154345,Its hotter because the heat from outside of the car go's in and it makes it hotter the air is stuck and the heat from outside makes it inside the car which  makes the air hotter.,2
154353,it is that because u left it in the sun,2
154371,I thought  it becouse  it is cool and if the heat comes then they become the same,2
154514,I think its warmer than the outside because its a cold day but its sunny but the sun makes the car mostly hotter than the outside so I think its warmer than the outside,2
154703,I think it is colder than the air outside because it has been sitting for a weak and maybe the other days were cold and that was the only day there was sun.,2
154155,"its going to bee warmer, scince it has not been used in a week. but the air inside it its starting to cool air",2
154151,dont,1
155053,It is colder because when its cold outside The air inside the car will get cold too from it.,2
153824,"I beleive this because Akbar's car might have been in the sun for a week, but because it's a cold day, that cooled the metal of the car, which basically made the car  refridgerator, cooling the inside of the car.",2
153822,I think this because if on a cold day he checks his car that has been siting in the sun for a week it was hot when it was sunny but since it is a cold day so the air would of went from hot to the same temp.,2
153844,It would be warmer than the outside air because it has been in the sun for a week and if the car has not been open than it has not been exposed to the cold air so it would be warmer than the cold outside air.,2
153852,Colder than the outside air because basically for example if it was a hot day the heat would cause the car (cars metal) would heat up then would cause temp. of the inside so its just the opposite of hot.,2
153838,There exactly the same air because what ever the air outside reflect's in the car in the inside so that why I think their the exact same same air.,2
155053,It would be cold because it has been sitting in the sun all week so it would have been waarm but the cold air would cool the car down.,2
153831,Because the cold air and the heat will affect the temperature.,2
153816,"If assuming all doors and windows are closed, the air is contained and, if it is sunny, will be heated, as it is not affected by the cold air outside.",3
153823,My awnser is who cares...,1
153837,"If it's a cold day and the car hasn't been used for a week, during the night it would be really cold so for seven days if it's just sitting there it would be colder than outside. Just because there's a little sunlight it still can't heat it up that much.",3
153864,it s warmer then the outside because outside the car there is wind and has probably changed weather several times where inside the car it doesn't release air so that it stays the same temperature  until it gets hot and then in the car it gets warmer.,2
153923,The radiation of the sun will heat up the car.,4
153928,It might be colder inside because it has not been driven an the motor is cold and not heated.,2
153909,"It is the same air temp because, the day is a cold day but the car has been parked in the sun for a week, so the cold air cools the car slightly but its still a little warm from the days being parked in the sun.",2
153913,Because the cars energy is not exactly the same as the air outside.,2
153917,i think this because the sun's heat gets trap in the car.,3
153916,"I think this because the car has been in the hot sun and has not been driven for a week, so the hot air will collect inside the car.",2
153935,I picked warmer  because when you park a car on a cold morning and leave it the sun for a week the car will probably be very hot inside since you left it in the sun for a week.,2
153922,if you keep your car in the sun for the whole day and go in it it is really warm,2
153921,It would be warmer because if it is left alone then the warm are would be trapped inside.,3
153934,euuc,1
153911,I have had experience with this it was a saturday and it was very cold the car was parked in the light and it was more colder than the outside air,3
153930,"One time my family left our car outside like Akbar did and when we got in it, it was colder than the outside air.",2
154112,It will be warmer because I have experienced this before.,2
153926,The sun comes in but since the outside air is cold the cold air cant get in and the cold air makes the outside cold but the inside is warm.,2
153908,I think it would be a little warmer because it would trap air in the car and the little sun it would get will get it a little warm.,3
153905,"Although the air outside the car is cold, the radiation from the sun enters the car and has a hard time exiting, because the windows makes it more difficult for heat to escape. Therefor, the temperature rises continuously.",4
153918,well since the car is protected and threres a heater I would think its hotter,2
153906,It matters on the day it happened because at night it is cold and in the morning it is cold so it would be cold.,2
153919,I think it will be warmer because like the plastic wrap and plexiglass the radiation will go through the windsheild  and the glass in the windsheild would keep the heat inside of the car.,4
153914,"The solar radiation from the sun shines on the car and then using conduction, the shines into the car and warms up the air in the car.",4
153927,because when the heat goes inside the car that is the heat,2
154135,it will be hotter because it has only been one cold day and there are six other days that are probably hotter than that one cold day. And the heat will stay in the car.,2
154124,"No matter if it is a hot day or cold day, since it is parked in the sun and has not been driven, it will always be hotter than the outside air. This is because the radiation from the sun soaked into the car and causing it to heat up. Also because it has not been driven, no heat escaped from the car.",4
154132,Because the car would have trapped heat when it was in the sun even though it was cold outside kind of like a solar oven.,3
154162,it would be warmer then the out the outside air because the air from outside wouldn't get in the car.,2
154134,It would be warmer because if its parked in the sun even if it's cold out the sun will create radiation in the car and there will be conduction when the heat passe trough the car.,4
154153,Because it's climate adapts.,2
154118,this is a form of conduction. the cold is outside is transferred to the car. this makes the car cold.,2
154155,"its warmer than the outside air, because scince its on a cold air, but it has been sitting on a hot day . The air inside the car its colder than it was in the sun , but its not cold ass the air OUTSIDE.",2
154119,It is warmer than the outside because it uses conduction. The heat comes into the car and it gets hot. Since there are windows that are all the way up the heat will not evacuate the vehicle.,3
154163,The progek is so hred and it is cool,2
154130,it colder because some of the cold air comes in the car and that makes it colder,2
154150,If it is hot outside so it could be cold because the car is shut and its been sitting outside for a week during that week it could have been cold most of the time and when he goes to go drive the car it is going to be cold even though it is out in the sun.,2
154122,When a car is outside in hot weather it will be more hot in the car cause of the heat trapped inside and more heat entering same with when its cold,3
154127,It will be colder because the air in the car was never exposed to the sun unlike the air outside of the car. The air was concealed in the car and kept cold.,2
154143,Becuase when you get in the seat is cold unless you put hot air but still it is the same,2
154128,It is warmer than the outside air because it has been parked in the sun for a week and untouched so the radiation from the sun is going into the car and is trapped in the car.,4
154141,It's going to be warmer inside the car because the sun radiation shines inside the car. And the weather will insulate the inside.,3
154145,It is going to be cold than the outside air because since it's cold the metal of the car passes the cold air in the car.,2
154151,the engen is so so calde that it wont trun on,2
154208,Radiation heats the car and conduction heats the walls of the car. Convection circulates heat in the car.,4
154202,"Because the car was parked for an entire week, the car had plenty of time to heat up, if the windows were closed.",2
154193,The cold air could not go in the car because the car is closed and the eat from the sun goes in the car and thats how its warmer than outside.,2
154200,The car hasn't been driven for a week so the car will absorb the energy of the car but also absorb the coldness too.,3
154206,The air inside the car will be warmer than the air outside because the car was never opened so  the air got warmer from the sunlight.,4
154224,Warmer because Akbar has not turned on the A.C. in seven days.,2
154212,I think this because if it is a cold day than the air in the car would most likely be warmer than the outside. It also has been in the sun for a whole week.,2
154214,The suns rays have been hitting the car for a week so it will be warmer than the outside air.,3
154216,It would be warmer because of the sun's radiation from that whlr week.,3
154218,well i think its really cold inside his car because its cold outside and it traps all the cold air into the car and if it was hot then it would be warm in the inside of the car because it would trap the heat in it to.,2
154221,It would be warmer because the hasn't escaped the car.,2
154226,The sun's hot energy is warming the car up.,3
154217,even if it is cold but on the sunny side it is cold in side but it is hot out side1,2
154220,it is warmer inside than outside air because you can change the tempeture from inside.,2
154199,It is warmer because if it has not been driven for a week and the sun shines on it it is heating up the car.That would be if the week would be warm and sunny.The sun is parked in the sun meaning that the heat waves would go directly into the car.,3
154198,His car was parked in the sun for a week and 1 day when its cold. So it'll be hotter inside.,2
154215,Because the air can not come inside  of the car. And also cause the windows aren't open.,2
154196,I think it will be cold inside the car because the cold air will go through the vents and the cold air will build up and cause the temperature to drop.,2
154201,If it was a hot day and your car was parked outside the car sit would heat up and the hot air inside would be exactly the same heat as outside.,2
154205,The car was parked in the sunny spot and had heat and heated up quicker if he didn't drive the car.,2
154197,"since it is a cold day, the car would be cooled of by he cold air and heated up by the sun.",2
154204,If the car is in the sun the car it is going to be warmer because it is in the sun instead of it being in the shade where it is warme.,2
154195,"The heat energy from the sun will trap itself inside the car and will not escape, heating it up. This is an example of radiation.",4
154311,The windows in the car is reflecting the heat so when the heat gets inside it is warm.,2
154322,Well I know that if it is sitting in the sun it will still get warmer eave though it is cold outside. Also I know that the heat from the sun is heating up the car or making it warmer but outside it is not getting as much heat as the car since it is parked in the sun.,2
154310,Its going to be colder  than the outside because the air is in the car.the air moculos will cool down and will be in the car stuck.the seats will be cold.The cars engine can  get it colder.,2
154327,It would be warmer because the sun would heat up the car then since there is one cold day it still be slightly warmer.,2
154342,I chose the exact same temperature as the outside because from the hot days of the week the car absorbed and trapped the warm air so when it turned cold the heat in he inside turned warm from the mixing of cold and hot air in the inside of the car.,2
154326,the car can not release he warm air.,3
154324,I think it would be warmer than outside air because the air is already cold and the sun is beating down on the car which HAS to warm the car up at least a little bit.,2
154319,"I believe this because when you car is being hit by the sun whether or not it's cold or warm the sun's radiation is being radiated into the glass or plastic they have on the car windows and windshield the car is getting warmer because the radiation is turning into heat energy inside the car and because most cars don't have holes in them the car is just holding in that heat so if its 40 degrees fahrenheit outside but, the sun is out and hitting the car the car will most likely be warmer like 60-80 degrees fahrenheit. That is why I believe the car would be warmer than the outside after a week of being hit by the sun.",5
154343,i think that that the car would get hotter than outside because its closed and well sealed,2
154307,I think that the inside of his car will be warmer then the outside because since it has been outside for a week and not turned on there is no cold air so there is no way that the hotness of outside inside can get out.,2
154371,because it is like a spoon that has metal and metal burns in heat and the car is made out of metal so it will be really hot inside,2
154353,it would be colder because the cold air would be innsolated in the car.,2
154336,Its beacse a car gets more heated up beacuse its loke and no air gets and that air turns warmer witch gets the hot andthat makes the difference,2
154325,"The car that is parked in the sun will be a bit warmer than outside because, the car has not been driven for a week and it has been absorbing heat while being parked outside in a source of heat.",3
154329,I think it would be colder because if it was parked for a week under the sun and its a cold day then it would be cooler inside the car. Because the air circulates outside the car and inside the car it stays cold because the air is like a freezer.,2
154323,it get hotter because heat will come through the glass and cant escape so the car heats up.,3
154345,It's going to be hotter because when the sun hits it it going to gather heat even if its cool outside.,2
154703,Because if it was sitting there on a hot day all the sun radiation and heat would get traped inide,4
155334,Because the heat is going in the car and making it hotter inside than it is outside.,2
153836,When the car is in Sun the solar radiation gets trapped into the car and uses convection.,4
153834,"Even though the car is parked in the sun, it is also cold so the cold makes the metal cold, and trapping the cold air in.",2
153863,"I believe that the temperature would be warmer than the outside air because the outside air isn't touching the inside air because you aren't actually touching the inside air because everything that is around the car is blocking  outside air to go in the inside of the car, but the outside air would surround the outside air.",2
153843,because the car attracts heat when you leave it in your drive way then you get in and all the heat is in the car so it stays in unless you roll a window down,2
153826,"It is colder because it has not been driven so it would not be warmed up, and it is a cold day.",2
153856,The reason i chose that answer because i had the question before and so i checked if it would be cold inside the car like the outside.Then it was exactly the same  temp. like the  outside.Even if its a hot day it would be hot inside the car like the outside.,2
153848,I think it is warmer than the outside air because the sun is directly hitting the car.,2
153835,The car will be colder than the air outside because the engine has not been run for a week so the car will not have any source of energy to heat the car up.,2
153860,If the air surrounding the car is cold the car will also be cold inside.,2
153827,If it was parked out side in the SUN the inside of the car would be warm because if cold air is pushing on he car the amount of energy put in to that would make the inside of the car warm.,3
153830,"The sunlight would pass through the windows and the heat from the solar radiation would stay inside the car heating it up. If the car had black seats the seats would absorb heat from the outside also. The cold air outside would make the outside of the car cold, but since the inside is heating up, the closed doors wouldn't allow the hot air to escape or the cold air to come in.",5
154514,Colder Because when you leave the car in outside for a long time without use in the col air its gonna be pretty cold.,2
153859,because the cars hood reflex  most of the sun rays,3
153832,"The sun heated the car and the seats, leather, and other things in the car and like a solar oven it keeps heat in the car so it is hotter than the outside air.",3
153854,The air from outside will travel through the car and the car will be the same tempeture.,2
153839,The air outside the car will be the same as in the car because the air will travel towards the car and it being parked in the sun will make no difference.,2
153818,"The sun will heat up the car to a hotter temperature than the temperature of the air. Warm air won't be able to leave because the car is a vessel.

Again, (as in the pretest) the question below doesn't make sense. If the day is freezing, would that affect the temperature more than the sun? They aren't comparable.",3
153915,because its been outside for a whole week.,2
153925,the black absorbs the heat so it gets hotter inside,3
153912,well if its hot outside the sun well get in the car because of the windows,2
153924,It would be hot because if he left it for weeks it would be worm it was geting hit by the sun for week every day,2
153936,warmer because it parked in the sun,2
154148,Because if the car has been there for a week it would have the air that is had last time plus the air could have gotten in anyway  so it would have the outside air.,2
154152,When the hot air reflects to the inside of the car it all gathers up and i think it becomes Radiation.,2
154160,I think it's colder than the outside air because the air in the outside is cold so it makes the car colder.,2
154157,I think its warmer then the outside air because if his car was in the sun  for a whole week it will be hotter.,2
154147,I chose this answer because if the car is insulated in the inside the it would be harder for he cold air it get into the car and since the car is parked on under the sun it gets warmer.,2
154159,this happens to my mom's care,2
154161,The reason that i pressed that the car is colder than he air because it happened to my mom's car and it happens every day.,2
154146,I think it would be colder than the outside air because if you leave it in the shade it woul be colder. It also depends where you leae the car because if you leave it out in the sun it would become more hotter than the outside.,2
154211,Even though it's in the sun it hasn't been driven in weeks and it would be just as cold as outside.,2
154210,I  think the air inside the car is warmer than the outside air because the sun radiation went through the car's window. e radiation that went into the car go warmer and warmer making it hotter in the car.,4
154223,it,1
154207,I think its warmer than outside because the sun is hitting the car and when the sun hits the car it gets warm.,2
154321,I think the car is warmer than the outside air because with our solar ovens when we tested them in the morning we put a light on them for 5 minutes and it got warmer than the outside air.,3
154318,I think that it is warmer then outside because its been there for a week and its been in the sun for a week and that is why i think that it is warmer inside.,2
154330,"the car will be colder that the air outside, because the car would have gotten colder over time. so it will be colder than outside. and since its cold outside the car will get cold and go through the car.",2
154194,"We dont know how hot the other days were or what his car looks like ,but if its been outside for a week it ought to be hotter than the air around it.",2
149950,Because my mom didn't drive for a while and when we opened the door it was really cold.,2
149966,"Because it is a car, the heat trapped inside would make it warmer. It may still be cold, but is warmer than the outside air. But the air outside would still make it cold, just not as cold.",3
149972,The cold air will start getting into the car and making it cooler until it matches the air temperature.,2
149587,"I think it will be warmer than the outside air because the car that has been sitting in the sun, so because of radiation, heat will be transferred to the car. The cold air wont go to the car because cold is the absence of heat and only warm air moves to cold air in the car so the car must be warmer.",3
149959,because the car tempature will get hotter and colder because it is night time and night time is really cold,2
149953,The warmness leaves the car and goes somewhere else and the cold is free to go in.,2
149970,It has collected enough heat to level the cold.,2
149963,"I chose that the car is warmer than the outside air because when a car sits in the sun for a long time, it gets warmer than the outside air",2
149590,i think it will be warmer than the outside air because it has been parked for a week in front of the sun and the sun made the inside of the car hot and the outside of the car cold.,2
149956,The sun gets hot but it is still cold outside so it has to be warmer,2
149964,The reason why I think that it would be warmer than the outside air is because the car has been sitting in the sun all week.,2
149961,it not have any heat inside the car,2
149588,"Warmer because the cold is not going in the car, and heat transfers into cold.",2
150650,I think this is the right because if it has been in the sun all week the air inside  is stuck so it gets hot in the car.,3
149968,The air is colder because the car is little and in will keep the cold air in side.,2
149955,I chose colder than the outside because it was outside for a week and that is a long time.,2
149967,I chose this answer because its warmer outside,2
149589,"Since the car has had so much time to heat up in the sun, it traps some heat inside the car, making it hotter in the car than it is outside.",3
150648,colder because if it a cold day the tempurature will be the same as the air outside.,2
149960,i say that its warmer than the outside air because if the sun can give u a sun burn on a cold day then i think it can warm up a car.,2
149965,The car is is taking air from outside the to inside the car.,2
149954,it gets hot inside the car because of the sun,2
149962,the inside of your car is warmer than the outside because you can turn the heater on in your car but you cant turn a heater on outside,2
149947,"If it is cold outside, and your car is parked in the sun, the sun's rays will warm up the car.  This is called conduction.",3
149958,I chose this because the car has not been run so there was no AC but it was in the sun for a week and since the car is closed air can get in but not out.,2
149957,It would be warmed up by the sun.,2
149969,The sun is over it and there is hot air trapped in the car since it has not moved for a week.,3
149951,it will be cold because if it is cold on the outside it will be cold on the inside,2
149971,"I think this because since the car was left in the sun, it was probably hotter than the outside air.",2
149586,I said this because when i go to school then my dad drives me to school it stills fill the same coldness.But after a while it gets a little worm.,2
150065,"The car has probably not had it's heater ran in weeks so the car is probably very cold.  It might not be insulated, so, some extra cold air that hadent already cooled down probably escaped.",2
150066,I think it is warmer than the outside air because if it has been sitting our for a week and has been sitting out in the sun it probably would have kust sat there and gathered the warm air and got hotter.,3
150074,"I think this because, if it is a cold day and the sun is still shining then the air inside the car should be the same as the outside air.",2
150076,"Although I am not sure for this question, I think it is 'Colder than the outside air' because the car has not been driven for a week, and so the temperature will be  depended on the weather outside. Car's temperature can be changed easily. The heat inside will escape, leaving the cold air inside.",2
150073,The cold air and the warm air are both heating and cooling the car  but the sun is farther away than the cold air is closer so the sun just prevents it from getting really cold,2
150078,If it is cold outside and the car has not been used in a week it takes a while for the car to warm up.,2
150070,Because the temperature will level out between the outside and the inside of the car,2
150072,"I think it is warmer air because he parked in the sun, But I also think it's colder air because it was on a Cold Day, but only for a day, and he parked there and hasn't drove the car in a week, so that's why I think it's warmer.",2
150075,It is warmer because the sun warms up the air inside the car and the heat in the car stays in the car.,3
150077,"The car has been sitting out for a week. The convection makes the car warmer than outside. I've had this kind of experience once. It was cold, but when I got in the car, it was warm. The doors were open, so the cold air blew in.",3
150069,"The inside of the car will be warmer than outside because he parked it the sun. I know this because whenever I get into my dads car and its cold out, the car always feels warmer than outside.",2
151162,Because the car is parked in the sun so it warms up the car.,2
150052,I picked this answer because how could the car get hotter then the weather outside and how could the weather be colder than outside.So thats why i choose the answer  that it stays exacly the same weather as outside.,2
150067,because it was a cold day and in the morning if the air is cold then my car is cold,2
150063,I chose the second answer because if the car is parked in the sun it is in direct heat.,2
150056,I think it would be colder because it has stored up all the cold air from the night and the day. Also when i get in a car on a cold day it is colder than it is outside that's why you have a heater.,2
150061,I chose warmer than the outside air because it is sitting in the sun.,2
150059,It would be warmer inside because first of all it has been sitting in the sun second because it has not been drove for several days and when that happens it always gets really warm inside.,2
150062,I think that Akbar's car is warmer than the outside air because his car has been parked outside in the hot sun for a week so his car has to be warmer inside than the outside air.,2
150064,It's warmer in the car because the air is hot and the cars windows were closed. But still air can get in the last time he drove  the car the hot air got inside of the car too.,3
150079,Because it's been really hot and the car has been driven in a week so it is propal hot on the inside.,2
150053,because im the morning it would be cold but then as it got hotter the car heated up and it just kept doing that so the car would get so cold it would be the same temperature as the air out side and sme with the heat.,2
150054,Since in is a cold day and his car is parked in the sun I would say the car would be the same as the outside air because the sun makes the car heat up while it is cold.,2
150055,My answer is exactly that same as the outside air i choses this answer because once that happens that what happen to my mom car to .,2
150058,It warmer then the outside air becouse the coler of the car,2
150060,"Even though it is cold outside, the heat has been trapped in his car.",3
150071,The car has not been driven for a week so I think it is hot inside.,2
150057,The engine was off so it was probably cold.,2
150085,I believe this because the sun is heating up the air inside. The cool air around it is being heated up causing no temperature on the inside making the air inside get warmer.,3
150098,"It chose that the air inside the car might be warmer than the outside air. This is because if it is a cold day at the moment your not going to want to make the air inside the car cold if its a cold day at the moment, your going to want to make the air inside the warm so you can stay warm.",2
150087,I chose colder then the outside air because every time I get into my car and it is a cold day it is colder than the outside air.,2
150104,the metal in the car would make the car cooler that the air really is,2
150101,It will be warmer than the outside air because it has been outside in the sun not driven for a week.,2
150099,I think the inside of the car would be warmer than outside because it is a cold day but the car is parked in the sun. If it is parked in the sun the sun will probably be pointed on the car so that would make the car warmer. Also if you park your car in the sun on a hot day while you go do something like grocery shopping when you get back the car is hotter than outside. Also if it is cold outside and you go into the bathroom at school or something it is usually warmer inside than outside.,2
150105,"I think the temperature will be the same, because the car will cool down, but cool air isn't trapped in there, so it would be the same temperature.",2
150109,it must be colder than the outside air because all the heat is trapped inside and turns cold because when the temperature outside drops the inside must be cold too.,2
150093,i think wamer because the car is outside in the sun and when my mom does that not even for 30 mins it is supper hot already.,2
150086,well if it is cooler outside than its cooler inside the car.,2
150097,I think that the inside of the car is going to be warmer than the outside air because the other days could have been hot and he has not been in the car for 7 days so the cooler air turns warmer,2
150083,I think it would be warmer than the outside because its gust sitting in the sun and it hasn't been driven for a week.,2
150114,it will mack the car wormer and you can drive it when irs worm,2
150094,because the sun produces heat,2
150084,I say my answer is that inside the car is warm because there is heater inside.,2
150082,I think that it might me more cold because it is always either to hot inside the car or to cold inside the car. But since he wasn't in the car for a while and it was cold outside it would be even more cold because it traps all the cold air.,2
150103,"The car would be warmer than the outside air, because, when the car was left outside in the sun, it warmed up. Since the car doors remained closed when the cold air arrived, the warm air was trapped inside.",3
150090,Because i've had exeperience with this when you havnt drove your car in a while and its hot outside it will be more hot in the car thats why you should not keep dogs in the car on hot days,2
150092,i chose my answer because a car can heat up faster than out side air 1 ression of this is the car is seld and heat enters and the cold stays thats why i think that for my answer.,2
150080,how it says in the sun.,2
150111,because it said it was parked in the sun,2
150112,The car is as cold as outside because its been sitting i the cold for week the air most likely went threw the air vents.,2
150096,The answer is colder than than outside air because the wirter said on a CO,2
150100,I think it is warmer inside because if the car was out in the sun for days the coldness could barely affect it.,2
150108,warmer,2
150106,the outside air is colder but the inside is warmer it has air hot,2
150081,It warmer inside because the air has nowhere to go.,3
150110,because the outside air has been hitting it for a week and at any time the air can change but the air was hot so inside the car is hot because win the air gets trapped inside the car it will stay in the car in tell someone gets in the car,3
150132,"Since the car has been sitting out in the Sun for a week, I think that the car is warmer. No cold air can get into the car since it's closed up, therefore, the insides of the car are warmer than the outside air.",3
150133,I chose the second answer because if he parked it under the sun and it has not been driven fro a long time the car's inside temperature will be warmer.,2
150130,THe reason i think this is because the car has been sitting in the sun for a long time if it is not in use. So the sun heats up the inside of the car and makes it warm.,2
150127,I chose warmer than the outside air because the heat from the sun is coming into the car. The heat from the sun heats the air inside the car. It gets warmer then the outside air because that is the only air in there. There is no other air coming into the car.,3
150117,"I picked Colder than the outside air because it was a cold day. If it has not been driven for a week, then it would be cold. just because it was parked in the sun, doesnt mean that it will be warm. In the night, it could be cold, in the morning it could still be cold with the sun barley peeking out.",2
150115,There is insulation in the car.,2
150124,I would think the car would be warmer than outside because if its in the sun and hasnt been driven for weeks than its probably hot.,2
150131,It would be hotter because there would be the warm air from the week before plus the most recent temperatures.,2
150134,"I picked warmer than it is outside because when my car is in the sun for awhile, it is always hotter than outside.",2
150145,if its parked in the sun it is getting wormer than it is in the outside,2
150137,The car will be warm due to the radiation and the heat so the inside of the car will get warmer than the outside especially since it has been in the sun for a week.,3
150139,When the sun is shining on the car it gets hotter inside but the cold air outside the car is making the the warm air inside the car a little bit colder so the temperature in the car is warm.,2
150149,Since the car has been parked in the sun for a whole week I think that it will be a little warmer than the outside air because the car is all locked up and nothing can get inside.,3
150140,It's warmer than outside because it's parked in the sun so it could heat up.,2
150122,"I think it will be warmer than the outside air because even though it's a cold day, its parked in the sun and as we all know when a car is parked in the sun is can get much warmer inside.",2
150123,"Even though it is a cold day, a week before it might been a warm day and the heat is trapped inside the car since it hasn't been driven for a week.",3
150138,Because the sun makes the car hot.,2
150118,the window let the radiotain in but not out,4
150136,"I believe the inside of Akbar's car would be warm if it's been outside, in the sun, for a week.",2
150142,I chose this answer because it makes the most sense unless you had the heater full blast wile you were gone and left your car running,2
150125,I think it is the same because if it was in the sun but now in the cold I believe it balances out to the same as the outside air.,2
150116,The temperature outside would give the car the same.,2
150126,I choose this answer because since it has been in the sun for a week the air inside the car would be a little warmer if it's not too cold outside.,2
150148,it says on a cold day Akbar walks to his car that is parked in the SUN and hasn't been driven for a week.,2
150135,If he did not drove his car in a week his car is the same temperature as outside.,2
150128,It is warmer because it is in the sun and has been in the sun for a week.,2
150144,cars build up heat from the sun,2
150516,I think is warmer in the car then the outside because it has not been driven in a week and the sun has been shining on it.,2
150120,it is always warmer in your car than outside but it depends on what car you have if you have leather on the inside then you will be hotter because the seats take up all the heat.,2
150129,I think that Colder than the outside air is correct because even though there is sun shinning on the car it is still cold so the outside temperature is will change the temperature of the inside of the car.,2
150121,why is because they did not say that the car windows had sun beaming inside the car. i have got into a car on a very cold day and it is much colder inside than outside because the coldness has been sinking the the car while the sun probably been on the car for 3 hours - 4 hours.,2
150143,I think its warmer than the outside air because it hasn't been driven for a week/7 days.,2
150146,Since the outside air is coold then the car would absorb the temperature which is cold and make it colder,2
150141,because when my dad parks his car in the sun its warmer than the outside air,2
150195,I think it will be the temperature as outside because the suns warms Earth so if outside its cold then inside it should also be cold.,2
150200,I chose warmer than the outside air because it was in the sun for seven days and not driven and it was only one cold night.,2
150198,"The reason I think this is because,the car itself has not been driven for a week and we dont know the weather from the day before that which could have been warmer.Also,even if it was a cold day it was still parked in the sun which gives it more heat than what the temprature is outside.",2
150158,Because when ever i am in the car its hot then when I get out,2
150159,"If you leave your car outside with no heating, it will be colder then the outside temperature.",2
150153,the car is parked in the sun so the suns energy heats up the car,3
150162,"I think the car is slightly warmer because it doesnt really give me any detail about the car, like, it doesnt say if his mom had the car running or if the car was off. So, I am gonna say for my awnser, If the car is on. Then yes it is warmer in the car. But if the car is off, then no its exactly the same temperature in the car as it is outside.",2
150173,It is going to be colder because warm air moves and cold air stays.,2
150164,If the car was not opened for a week the car itself would be warmer due to there aren't any cracks big enough to equalize the temperature.,3
150178,"I choose this answer because when its a cold day, the inside of the car gets cold too.",2
150176,"It only describes this day being cold, therefore it must mean that it could still be warm inside.",2
150166,I think this because since he or she hasn't been driven in a week then probraly  it will be the same temparature.,2
150160,I think the car will be warmer than it is outside because when my dad parks our car in the sun on a cold day when we get in it is really warm.,2
150155,well the car has been collecting heat without any way to get rid of it and from my experience every car i've been in that has been sitting in the car  for a while has always been very hot,3
150172,I think this because if a car is in the sun and wasnt driven for 2 weeks then its gonna be warm,2
150175,I chose warmer than outside air because if its hot outside and you haven't been in your car in a week its going to get hot in the car because their are no windows open and because of that the hot air is just stuck inside a car.,3
150161,I think it is going to be warmer because when my mom or dads car is mostly parked in the hot sun it is actually more hotter in there than it is outside when i am not inside the car.,2
150177,Because none of the air from the outside is reaching the inside of the car and since it has not been driven for a week it will be a lot cooler because the car has not been running for a while.,2
150163,I know this because I read something about leaving dogs in a car and it said that  cars are always warmer inside then out,2
150157,in the car there is AC (air conditioner)and out side is hotter or colder.,2
150174,It says on a cold day and Akbar parked his car in the sun and it has not been driven for a week.,2
150154,It is the same as the air outside because it says that it is that the sun was hitting it and it was a cold day so it must be the same as outside. And also it can't be colder than outside and it can't be warmer that outside.,2
150167,If a car is in the cold more hot air will push in whilst more cold air will come out and won't be able to go.,2
150194,I think that the cold air would act like a refrigerator and start to make the air in the car cold,2
150168,The reason why I chose the answer in the middle is because the car is parked in the sun.,2
150170,I think it would be colder because all that cold air has been trapped there for a week.,2
150171,I think it's colder inside the car because the cold air got in side and the car hasn't been driven for a week.,2
150199,"Maybe the last time Akbar drove his car, it might have been hotter, so that hot air might have stayed in the car so inside the car might be warmer than the outside.",2
150196,rr,1
150201,Because it is darker,2
150156,when the ac turns on then air is cold,2
150243,"It is warmer inside the car because since he parked in the sun, the cold air will not take over, only the warm air.",2
150204,I think the answer will be warmer then the outside air because the sun is very hot and the car was left outside for a whole week and has not been driven.,2
150244,When ever I get in a car it is always warmer on the inside than the outside.,2
150219,"I chose this answer based on the fact that heat is stronger than cold air, and also based this on personal experience.",2
150231,I think this beacuse since he/she parked it in the sun it would probely be a littel marmer inside.,2
150236,It would be warmer air because if it sits in the sun it would become hot that is what happens to almost everything.,2
150246,"I think its colder because the cold air gets trapped inside, and with the cold air outside it would get colder.",2
150240,"The car has been parked outside for a week in the sun, so the sunlight has probably gone through the windows and the heat has been trapped in the car. It is cold outside, but the car has been parked in sunlight for so long, the inside of the car must me warmer than the outside.",4
150242,"The car is warmer than outside because it is not completely exposed to the outside air, it is in an enclosed space. The car will warm up when you start it.",2
150218,If its a cold day than the temperature will change,2
150226,It would be warmer because it is cold so not much sun is heating it up,2
150208,I think it will be colder  than the outside air because the is sitting in the cold and the cold will get trapped in the car because there is no warm air in the car.,2
150235,"In the mornings, I get in my moms car and it is really cold.",2
150220,I think the temperature will be the same because he has not driven it in one week.,2
150228,it has not been used on a cold weather outside.,2
150223,The car is parked in the sun and he hasn't driven the car for a week and even though it's cold outside the sun is still heating up the car this is an example of radiation.,3
150205,i pick warmer because it hasn't been open and in the last week you didn't open it and it might have the temperature from last week.that why i think it is the warmer than the outside air.,2
150230,because the cold air can not get out of the car,2
150249,Sometimes when its cold outside and you get in your car it gets warmer that's why I chose that answer.,2
150245,"I chose colder than the outside air because when I get into the car on a cold morning, I always feel colder than it is outside.",2
150203,I predicted this answer because my family would have the A.C on at this temperature of heat.,2
150248,I picked this because this happened to me in life.,2
150222,because the warm sun is sparkling on the car which makes it warm inside.,2
150237,because even tho it been hot for a week its cold now because of the weather now,2
150241,I chose the second one because there might have been hotter days and the radiation from the sun would heat the car up even when it is cold    .,3
150221,The sun made the car hot.,2
150206,well on a cold day it was parked in the hot sun so it marjinal like hot and cold so warmer,2
150247,because the air would have gotten in to the car,2
150215,The temperature will be hot'er then outside are becuase the car has ben in the sun alot longer,2
150239,I think that Akbar's car is the same as the outside air because the cars temperature changes when the weather changes it doesn't stay the same as it was a week ago.,2
150207,the air conditioning has not been on for a week so the car is cold,2
150238,I think it's warmer than the outside air because the car might have built up warmth in it or it could just be the heater,2
150214,I think it is going to be a little warmer then it was outside because car tened to be warmer.,2
150095,I chose this answer because the air from the outside travels in areas like say the A.C. or other open spaces in the car.,2
150089,"I think it will be warmer in the car because the warmer air from the other day sits in the car and stays, so the cold air from the outside will only make a difference on the outside of the car not the inside.",2
150119,I think the inside of car is colder than outside because the car has been sitting there and nobody has drove so nobody turned on its a/c or heater so all the cold air gets into the car.,2
150197,I believe it is warmer then the outside air because the outer part of the car like the crust is exposed so it is cooler like the weather. The inside like the core hasn't been exposed so it should be normally warmer then you add the rays of the sun and the heat that has been stuck in the car.,4
150202,I will be colder be colder because the cool get in the car is cold then another colder day come and it will get colder.,2
150165,If the car has been sitting outside in the sun for a whole week and the doors are shut closed and it is hot outside the car will get hotter because when the hot air is shining on the car the car will trap the hot air inside the car and stay there. The sun shines through the window and lands on the seats so when you sit down in the car the seats will be very hot.,2
149590,i think that it will be warmer because it was parked all day in the sun in a cold day .,2
150648,warmer than the outside air is what I picked because the sun can shine through but since the car has not been opened or exposed to the cold the cold air can't get in.,2
149953,I think this because the outside air can contain the car and make it cold.,2
150071,"If the car has not been driven for a week, then the temperature would probably be warmer inside the car.",2
151162,its been outside for a week.,2
150067,Because the cold air gets trapped in side the car so the car will be colder,2
150134,I picked colder than the outside air because the car will attract more coldness from the outside.,2
150123,"If all the windows and doors are open then it will be the same as outside, but if the everything is closed then it will be warmer.",2
150128,"Though the day is cold, akbar's car is absorbing radiation from the sun, heating it up.",4
150136,"As it's said above, the CAR has been parked outside under the sun for an entire WEEK. Which therefore leads me to believe that, even if it's just been ONE cold day, the warmth located within the car will last for quite the time.",2
150122,Since it is parked in the sun it has kept the warmth from it inside the car despite the cold air outside and being parked there for a week.,3
150135,The car is warmer because the heat inside the car is hot because the heat is traped inside the car while the air outside is cold.,3
150231,becouse more heat is traped in the car.,3
150247,because its traping the hot air inside,3
150215,becuase you are mixing to tempicers,2
149959,because the cold air would cold up the car inside,2
149970,the elements cancel each other out.,2
149967,the heat was going inside the car and keeping the heat in,3
149957,"I think this,because it was parked in the sun for a week and this day was probably the only cold day",2
149961,If you park your car in the sun the car will become the outside air because it cant get warmer than the out side without it being on.,2
149954,I think it's warmer than outside because the sun has been hitting the car for the last week and there's cold air witch it makes the tempature more warmer than cold air because of the sun.,2
150073,The cold air comes in but never leaves so more and more cold air comes in and it becomes colder than the outside air.,2
150078,If it has been in the sun for a week it will become hot.,2
150077,"His car is parked in the sun and has not been driven for a week. The radiation from the sun goes into the car and heats up. It will be really hot in the car since he didn't drive it in a week. If he had a reflector on the front and back windows of his car, then it wouldn't be so hot.",4
150062,I think that Akbar's car is warmer than the outside air because it has been parked for a week in the hot sun.,2
150076,"I think the temperature will be colder than outside because the heat will escape the car, leaving the cold air inside.",2
150130,The car was sitting in the sun and the sun heated up the inside because the sun warmed the outside then it seeped into the car.,2
150115,The insulation in the car that's supposed to keep the car warm when it's cold makes it hotter.,2
150149,Even though it is a cold day the car is parked was parked in the sun for a whole week so I believe that it will be warmer than the outside air.,2
150125,I believe it is the same as the outside air because if it's hot and cold I think it would balance out.,2
150124,It would be hotter because he hasn't ran the air conditioning in the car or done anything else with the car so it would be warmer o  the inside than the outside air.,2
150177,"It's because the car as not been running ,also because the the air on the outside is cold",2
150178,"If the car hasn't been driven for a week, then its cold like the outside air.",2
150198,I think this because the car origanaly had warmer air.Also it was parked directly into the sun.Even if its a cold day the heat from the sun would make the car warmer.,3
150175,It would be warmer than it is outside because there is not that many places were cold air can come in.,2
150161,I think it is warmer than outside because the sun was hitting the seat of the car and it will be so hot like if you are burning.,2
150196,it would be cold because ti has been siting the cold for a week,2
150202,I is going to be colder cause the cold stays in while it is colder,2
150172,If it was parked in the sun for weeks then its gonna be warmer.,2
150226,I think this because the car is thick and the air can get inside that easily.,2
150204,I think it will be exactly the same temperature because it is cold out side and the cold air will be trapped inside the car.It will also be cold because it hasn't been turned on in a week so the engine didn't heat the car up.,2
150223,The air would be warmer in the car than the outside air because he left his car in the sun so the car was heating up when he wasn't using it.,3
150145,if he didn't go to the car for a whole week it has to be colder because the windows are going to be cold and they can make the heat cold in the car,2
149968,I think it is going to be colder than the outside air because it has been there for a lot of weeks.,2
149966,"Akbar has not driven in a week, and if it is a cold day, most likely the other days were cold also. Since the car has been out during the cold days, it must be freezing inside. Even if there is sun. The air outside was cold, so it made it freezing also.",2
149963,"I chose that the car would be colder than the outside air because the question said, On a COLD day",2
149586,Also after a while inside the car the air gets warmer.,2
149958,I think it would be colder on the inside of the car because there wouldn't have been very much heat on the outside  to warm the car and keep it heated so it would just continuously cool down.,2
149589,The heat from the outside is trapped inside the metal car.,3
149951,it is warmer because it is parked in the sun,2
149588,"Warmer than the outside air because only heat travels into the car when it had been cold. Heat can travel, cold can't.",3
149956,You should have the car get colder because most of the cold air should go in the car and when you dont drive it for a long time it does start to fog up and it gets cold.,2
149587,Heat is the absence of cold so heat got into the car because hot things move towards cold things and cold things dont transfer anywhere so it wpuld have to be cold outside and warmer inside.,2
149962,"When you have not driven a car for a week it gets cold but if you do drive your car every day it will not get so cold. As you leave a car outside it gets colder by the minute. This means if you leave you car outside for a week  it gets really cold, and by 24 hours it gets supper cold. It will still get cold weather it is hot or cold outside.",2
149972,"A car, like a solar oven, works like a greenhouse trapping heat.  That will make it hotter than the outside air even on a cold day because there is still hear coming from the sun.",4
149960,if the car was in the sun then it would heat up the car.,3
150217,"The parked car is colder than the air outside because it has been sitting there in the cold air for an long time, therefor making the temperature of the car go lower than the air outside of it.",2
150065,The heat that was inside probably stayed inside and the cold stayed too.,2
150079,Why his car is hotter than outside is because it has been siting in the car for a week in the hot sun and the sun is attracted to dark colors and that's why the his car is hotter than outside.,2
150061,I picked the third one because the out temp. is what heats the car.,2
150060,The cold air has been trapped in the car for a long time.,2
150053,i picked exactly  the same as the air out side because if it has been sitting in the sun for a week it would heat up than cool down at night then when morning comes it would heat up again.,3
150063,The car will trap heat from the sun.,3
150052,I think that because how could the air inside be even hotter than the air outside.,2
150074,It is the same because the air outside is the main source of heat or light. It might be hot depending on how much the sun was beaming on the car.,4
150055,i think it will be colder then the outside because all the air goes in and it becomes more cold .,2
150064,"The car will be warmer because the air that is inside is hot, but if its in a car the car ai3r is hot.",2
150057,Every time my parents park in the sun for a while it get's so hot and feels hotter than outside. The sun heats it up.,3
150056,It will be colder because inside the car it has stored up all the cold air so it would be colder.,2
150070,because the air around it levels out with the temperature of the inside of the car,2
150075,I chose this because the air transfers the heat to the outside of the car making the air inside colder.,2
150054,There still might be heat that goes right through the glass and gets get trapped inside the car.,4
150058,The hot air from the outside is exactly the same cas the hot air warmer the car the same hot air.,2
150111,because if it was in the cold air outside it will be hotter in the car than outside,2
150108,the sun.,2
150082,The car will be colder than outside because it will trap in all the cold air.,2
150083,It's warmer than the outside air because the sun is shining on it and it tends to get hot and i have felt it before.,3
150127,"It says that was parked in the sun for a week and hasn't been driven, but it says he walked out to his car on a COLD day",2
150117,I think it is colder in the inside because it is a cold day. The sun is showing but the coldness that is surrounding the car will make it cold.,2
150516,I think it is the exact same temperature as the outside air because the air from the outside is going inside the car.,2
150137,I said this because if the car has been directly sitting in the sun for a week and has not been driven it will begin and it will heat up.,3
150133,It is warmer that the outside because if you were to leave a car in the sun for a long time then the sun will shine solar radiation on the windshield and then the inside of the car will attract then heat and stay like that.,5
150118,the sun is still making it hot but the cold air is able to get inside.,2
150121,why is that the car would have find warmth and would try to keep it in the car.,2
150116,The car would be out for a long time in the sun which would become hot.,3
150141,because when  I go to the store with my dad and come back to the store the car gets hot,2
150120,i think it will be warmer because i have a leather car and it is hot when i go in,2
150132,"It is warmer because it was originally hot in the car. The air outside is cold, it can't get in the car.",2
150167,Radiation is the heat from the sun and the elctromagnetic waves will absorb through the car.,4
150168,"Why I chose first answer was because if the car was not driven for a week, and if the air outside is cold than the inside of the car will be as cold as the outside.",2
150170,I think it is warmer than the outside air because the sun could've been shining on the car for a week and the heat from the sun is being transferred into the car. Also cold cannot move. It stays in one place.,3
150158,Because the hot air only can go in,2
150173,It is going to be colder than outside because the warm air inside would cool down and the outside is cold.,2
150162,"I think the car will be hotter then the outside because sence the car is made out of metal, it obsourbs all the heat and becomes hotter then the air around it.",2
150155,Well there is no way for hot air to get out of the car and it will just get hotter and hotter.,3
150174,It says it has been driven for a week and it has been parked outside in a sun.,2
150156,because he left it there for a week and its hot so it,2
150199,"Maybe Akbar drove his car on a hot day and maybe some of the hot air stayed in his car so when he gets into his car, it will be warm.",2
150176,"If the car was parked outside in the sun for a week, and only this day is cold, it must be hot inside.",2
150235,"The car was out for a week, so it was out longer than the cold was.",2
150241,I think it it will be warmer because there might have been a warmer day and the car will get warmer when not used.,2
150207,I think it will be warmer than the outside air because the car has been in the sun so it has been warming up for a week so it is colder than the outside air.,3
150206,I think it is warmer because when it is cold the car would be warm. This morning i went in the car and it was freezing outside and warm inside.,2
150221,I think the car will be warmer than the outside because the heat will get trapped inside the car.,3
150208,It will probably be warmer than the outside air because in the previous days the weather could have been hotter and the heat got trapped into the car.,2
150246,The car would absorb the cold air and get colder.,2
150244,Because the sun is reflecting on it so it would get hotter,3
150249,Because sometimes it depends what your car seats are made of.,2
150205,i said colder than the outside air because the inside is what is the outside air but the temperature changes inside.,2
155700,"It is a cold day, but the car has been parked in the sun for a whole week. The previous days might have been warmer.",2
150228,the hot air has been stuck there for a long,2
150218,I think that because the heat warms up in the car but the out side air stays the same,2
150242,The car is like an expensive solar oven. The sun warms up the car and it is very warm on the inside.,4
150203,It is hotter because it is trapping heat and heat is going in while the sun is out.,4
150240,"The car is warmer because the windshield is clear and has allowed sunlight to go through into the car. The car then traps the heat inside the car, making it warmer than outside.",5
150248,I picked this because that happened to my parents.,2
150237,because all the air goes in the car and only cold air go in but none out,2
150219,"The car got hotter from being in the sun for a week. The hot air inside has been trapped, but not able to escape. So, anytime heat gets in, it cannot get out again. Therefor the inside must be hotter. Although it is cold that day, it might have been hot the rest of the week.",4
150220,I think it would be warmer because the car probably still has the temperature of the warm air and the sun in the car.,2
150243,I think that it is warmer than the inside than it is outside because the car traps heat inside when it is under the Sun,3
150230,The cold air can not get into the car,2
150222,when your car is parked outside and it is a COLD day then i'm guessing it's cold at night so then the cold just keeps on coming.,2
150238,"On cold days sometimes the car can get colder because maybe the temperature gets through a small little opening, so the cold air can get in but can't come out. Then makes the car temperature cold",2
150245,"I chose this answer because the cold air outside combines with the air inside, which creates even colder air on the inside.",2
150214,I think it going to be warmer because in a car it is always warmer.,2
150239,The cars temperature goes  up and goes down with the temperature is around it.,2
150236,It would be warmer because if it has been sitting in the sun for weeks than it would get hot and also the air outside could of been hot the week before.,2
150201,Its hotter in the car because in the car all of the hot air goes in the car.,2
150197,I chose this answer because the car may have not been driven in a week  it has been out in the sun but that does not mean the inside is warmer.,2
150163,The car is warmer because of the heat trapped in the car from a few days ago.,2
150159,"If the air outside is cold, then the car will be warmer because its inside.",2
150160,It will be hotter because the more you leave something out in the sun the hotter it will get.,3
150165,If it is warm outside and the car has been sitting there a week the suns light has been beating onto the car and the car has medal so the seats inside the car and and outside of the car will attract the sun and the car will eventullay get hotter and hotter.,3
150171,It's because the air outside got inside the car and that's why it's the same.,2
150154,I think that it is colder than outside because that happened to me a lot of times when it was cold.,2
150166,I think this because since its been there for a week the temparature should be the same thing.,2
150131,"If the car was under the sun for the whole past week, the cold air and the sun should make the car almost the same temperature as outside.",2
150139,It is warmer because the sun is shineing on the car.,3
150140,"When Akbar gets in the car, it gets warmer when the sun is only heating up the inside.",3
150144,The heat would warm the car up but it is a cold day so the cold outside would cool the car down.,2
150143,I think this because if the air out side is cold and the car has been outside in the sun and have not been driven the car will be hotter than the outside air.,2
150119,The air from outside is the same as the air in the car because his car has been on for a week so all the cold air comes in from the outside.,2
150129,the sun is beating down on the car and making the inside of the car hotter.,3
150148,I picked warmer than the outside air because if its cold outside and the car is sitting right where the sun is directed that its most likely to be warmer than the outside air,3
150142,if it is a cold day the air inside the car would be colder,2
150138,it has been hot for the past week.,2
150126,"Just because it's cold, it doesn't mean everything outside is cold.",2
150090,because it will goi in the car then the air is trapped in the car so then it gets colder than the air because it is trapped in a tight space,2
150089,I think it is going to be warmer in the car then outside because when it once was warm and so the warm air in the car stays in there because warm air moves and cold air stays in place. So when it is cold outside the air stays cold and the warm air in the car stays warm.,2
150098,This is because since it is a cold day and the car has not been driven for a week it means that the air inside the car is the same as the outside air.,2
150093,"I think warmer then the air outside because one time our car was outside for a few hours, and when we went inside the car it was so hot inside
he car. This is why the car is warmer the outside.",2
150114,becuose to mack it warm in side,2
150086,because she's in the car,2
150106,the inside has been outside the cold the the outside.,2
150110,because at night time it is 99% cold so the cold air was hitting the car for 24 hours before the cold day so the car would be like 40 and outside it would be 60,2
150100,The reason I chose this awnser is because when you leave something outside and then cold comes all the heat escapes from the car and it is left cold.,2
150069,I chose this answer because the sun is going into the car; radiation is happening.,3
150066,I think it is going to be colder than the outside air because even though it is parked in the sun it is not going to make the inside hotter. If it is a cold day the coldness of the air will overcome the heat and be transferred into the car.,2
150072,"The car is the exact same air as the inside because if he did put on a reflecting sheet on the car then it would remain the same, if he didn't than the car would remain much colder. I'm not sure how he will get it warmer, but I'm sure for how it will be colder and the exact. When you stop the engine, the engine releases a final blow of cold or hot air into your car, so then if you get into the car afterwards, it will remain the same on a hot day. On a cold day, it will be colder than usual.",2
150059,I predict that it would be warmer on the inside because since it has been sitting in the sun for a couple of days  and it has not been drove either it has to be hot. I also predict that because it has happened with my dad's car .,2
149964,The air is going to be warmer than the outside air because the heat get trapped inside the car.,3
149950,I think this because the car has not been driven in a week so it would make the inside cold.,2
149955,I chose #2 because it has been there for one week and all the heat was inside.,2
149947,"It is cold outside, but the sun's rays make the car warmer than the outside air.",4
149965,It's going to be warmer than the outside air because it's in the sun for a week.,3
149969,The heat trapped in the car from before the cold day is still there.,2
150650,I think the air would be coder than the outside air because it has never had a chance to get released.,2
149971,because since the car has not been driven for a week the temperature will be  a little bit warmer than the outside air.,2
150153,the hot air that was trapped inside the car from the last time he drove his car.,2
150195,I think it is the hotter temperature as outside because heat is the only thing that can move the cold can not move so only heat would be able to get in.,2
150194,The car is insulated it would work just like a solar oven. It would heat up from the sun assuming that the car has its windows closed so cold air couldn't come through.,4
150164,There would be more density pacted in the car that can't get out.,2
150157,The heat goes in the car and cant come out so it gets hotter is the car.,3
150200,I think this because when the sun goes inside the car most of the time the heat gets trapped inside the car.,4
150169,because the air does not go in or out of the car and it stays warm,2
150101,I chose warmer than the outside air because if it has been outside for a week with hot temperature it would be really hot.,2
150105,"I think that although the car has not been driven, and the air is cool outside, I think the air will be warmer inside from the heat of the sun.",3
150112,I answered Warmer because the sun's radiation and is transferring heat to the car.,4
150085,I chose this answer because the sun is warming up the air inside the car. It doesn't matter whether the air outside is cold.,3
150094,the car acts like a cooler,2
150109,When you are in a car and it is cold outside it will have the same temprature as long as there is no sun like at night.,2
150080,because the sun is burning the car,2
150103,"Weather can vary from day to day. That day, the weather happens to be cold. But we don't know what the weather was like on the first day Akbar parked his car in the sun. Since Akbar didn't drive his car from that day on for a week, we can infer that the original temperature of the car is still trapped inside. But, then again, there is the weather for the rest of the week. But, most cars are constructed so that no hot air can escape, or any cold air can come in.",2
150097,i think that it is going to be hotter than outside air because the heat is trapped inside.,3
150095,It's colder than the outside air because of the openings in it and cold air doesn't mover and only hot air moves so since they cant move they clump inside the car making it colder.,2
150087,I chose this answer because when ever I got into my car and it is a cold morning and the sun is hitting the car the inside of the car is always colder than the outside tempature.,2
150096,I think it warmer than outside air because the car have heat in the car because the car is smaller and that happen in my momo car.,2
150084,"Inside the car is warmer than the outside air because it hasn't been for a week and it is parked out in the sun, so that means the sun's heat warmed up the car.",3
150081,it's warmer inside because the cold air isn't going inside the car so... ya the car is a house temperature,2
150104,if it is cold out side i think that the heat will leave the car and become cold as the air,2
150092,a car would absorb heat from the out side and the cold would leave the car.,2
150113,"If his car was in the sun for a week & he did not drive it for a week,the car can be hot . Because  in side of a car has a miterle that is black. It would be ever hot. If he had a thing that was simmer to tinfoil, the thing that simmer to  tinfoil the sun rese can refleckt back to the sun .The car would be cold, but it did not say that something  that was simmer to tinfoil that was in the car for a week. The car would be warm that's my prouth that the car is ever hot. - Payton Williams",3
150897,it keeps the heat in,3
150919,because hot water gos up and,2
150924,i dont know,1
151186,It is cold outside.,2
151195,because it been sitting in the burning sun for a week,2
151182,it is made of metal and it will heat up more then the outside. Trust me I have gone through that.,2
151180,I picked this answer because when I do not use my car and when I get on it it is colder then outside.,2
150923,because its cold outside so you have to have warm air,2
151193,it is cold outside,2
151230,i do not naswer,1
151228,I pick Warmer than the outside air because there are in the car.,2
151217,i do not know,1
151227,i think its warmer because  we know at the evening  its warm,2
151218,It's because since it is in the sun for a week then it's probably gonna be a little warm.,2
151209,i dow no,1
151213,The sun heats up inside the car.,2
151219,I think this because if the temperature is cold then it is the same in side.That happens in my car.,2
151589,The car has been been sitting in the sun. If the windows are rolled up it is probably warmer.,2
150899,I picked this answer because the car was in the sun.,2
150900,It actually depends if the person has the windows up or down,2
150908,I think it is exactly the same air outside because the air inside the car is hot and the air outside the car is cold so when it mix its the same temperature.,2
150901,"I said this because, whenever I go into my mom's car on a cold morning when the sun is shining it feels like how it was outside so we blast the heater.",2
150903,I think that because his car is probably metal and the metal gets colder.,2
150910,Because the air is very hot in a car and its because lots of people are dieing from staying in cars to long without air,2
150902,"I chose this answer because, when it is a hot day your car is just like the outside weather.",2
150909,The inside of the car would be exactly the same as the outside air because the inside of the car would just get colder over night.,2
150904,the car would heat up or cool down compared to the temperature outside.,2
150906,because the tempreture would be of all the days it wasent driven,2
150907,"I know this because a car, when it sits in the sun, it absorbs heat like if you are running with a black shirt on and it is 100 degrees out side, then you would sweat more and you would be warmer than someone who is wearing neon pink.",3
150905,"If it was not in the sun, it would be the same as the outside air. With the sun transferring energy to the car, the car is the warmer than the outside air because the energy is giving heat.",4
151224,It will be warmer because the sunlight from the sun gets trapped in the car causing heat keeping the car warm the whole week,4
151204,the car is warmer if it has been inside but if it as been outside it could be cold .,2
151221,The car will get cold because their are littles spaces in the car. Then the air would get inside the car.,2
151222,,1
151212,the inside of the car is warmer than the outside the air because the outside of the car would be protecting the inside of the car mostly from the cold air outside of the car.,2
151205,akbar car would be exactly the same as the outside air because the car starts out cold then the sun heats it up making it the same as the outside air.,2
151216,"If the car is in the sun, it will heat up inside and the car will become more hot than outside.",2
151203,its warmer then the outside air because if you parked your car in the sun and you don't have anything to make it get cooled down then of course it would and i know because it happened to me,2
151215,I think this because it is a COLD day outside and the car hasn't been driven for a week so it is not heated up making it neither cold nor warm in the car.,2
151223,Since it's a cold day and it's been parked in the sun it should be warmer even though it isn't driven for a week.,2
151208,It is in the sun so it is warmer.,2
151202,the car has somethings that makes it hotter.,2
151206,I think it is the exact because ;is letting it exhaust out and making it hot out.,2
151210,nosd,1
151226,it is warmer than the outside  air because in the question said akbar parked his car in the sun. So it means that its warmer inside the car.,2
151211,Because the the sun made the air hot in side.,3
151220,"The car has been sitting in the sun and has not been driven in a week, but the temperature is cold outside, so that means that the temperature will be the same outside.",2
151214,i think its  exactly as the outside because it might be leather and leather gets hot in the sun.,2
151231,car is room temp outside is hot.,2
151207,Its because the heat stays there keeps getting hotter and hotter,3
151229,When the sun is shining at the car it heats in inside of the car,2
151192,A car can trap all of the warm air inside of the car resulting in it becoming warmer. (   ),3
151188,If he has leather seats then it would be cooler then the outside because it can soak it in.,2
151178,"I think it will be warmer then the outside air because the car would conduct the heat overtime, and stay warm even when it is cold.",2
150915,Because its a cold day and he has not driven in it in a week.,2
151199,The car temperature will be the same because when u enter it will be the same because  you have not done anything,2
151191,the car is cooler than the air outside.,2
151196,I think it will be a little bit warmer because it has been in heat for a week and in cold for one day.,2
151200,I think that is colder than the outside air because when I walk to my car on a cold day it is always colder than the outside air.,2
151165,I pick the   that  because   when the hot air outside is warmer and if you leave the   car out  for a long time the air that's inside gets warmer .,2
150921,The air in the car is the same because the inside of the car is still the car.,2
151194,a car can trap all the warm air inside of car resulting in it becoming warmer.,3
150922,"because it is in the sun, which will make it warm, while the outside is cold",2
150917,When I walk into my car in the cold it's normally the same temperature as it is outside.,2
151176,He left his car there for a week so the temperature got colder outside and the temperature inside the car stayed the same.,2
151198,Its warmer because its been out in the sun for a week so I would expect it to be hot.,2
151174,i think it will be warmer than the air outside becauese it has been in the sun for 1 week and it is cold outside but the doors are shut so cold air cant get in  so the warm air is all alone inside the car,3
150918,"I chose this answer because the car was parked out in the sun for a week, and that would make the inside air of the car extremely hot.  It would be warmer than the outside air because the outside air has trees that could blow in the breeze or wind could appear occasionally, but usually no windows or doors are open in the car to let in little bits of cold air.  The hot air stays cooped up in the car which is now very hot.",3
151190,it is a closed space so it will be warmer than outside.,3
151181,I think this is the answer because the heater in the car is not on and condensation brings the cold air inside.,2
151189,It's colder because it is just in the outside not in the inside.,2
151201,becuse every temperture is the same,2
150916,because you are inside the car. The car has warm inside it.,2
152218,I would probably choose the second  one because the temperature is not same everywhere.Its even because the door of the car is remain close so the temperature outside cannot be inside.Even though it is has some A.C inside.So i have this thought about the second point.,2
150920,It is colder because there is air conditioner.,2
151179,I said colder than the outside air because if the car is sitting in the cold all day with a little sun for a week than it will become colder.,2
151225,because when you open the door the air comes in the car.,2
150909,"Because if there is sun reflecting on the car, it will heat up the car, so the car will be hotter than the outside air.",3
150902,"It would be exactly the same because if it is cold outside, inside the car it would be cold to but not colder.",2
150900,"It is warmer than the outside air because, the glass on the car worked as a conductor and the car was pretty much a solar oven.",2
150910,Because the sun shines on the car when it's hot outside,2
150919,coleder,1
150899,I picked my answer because the car has been sitting in the sun for a week.,2
150905,"Radiation from the sun is going into the car through the windows, making it warmer. But, the air outside is cold, making the car exactly the same temperature because the hot and cold are working against each other, so neither can win.",4
151216,I picked the last one because if it is hot outside and you park your car in the shade it will be the same weather as outside because the shade with just shade the outside of the car not the inside. That is why i think the same thing will happen with if it was cold outside and you park your car in the sun.,2
151208,The car is colder than the air out side because the engine hasn't been on for a week so the car  would be cold.,2
151222,"There are many various reasons why people choose their answers. The reason I chose my answer is because if you were to leave your car in the cold or in the shade, the inside of your car would get cold. How? Thats a great question. Well my answer is that it's radiation, it would be more likely caused from the electromagnetic waves.",3
151225,the sun heats the glass and then the in side it gets hot.,2
151229,Inside the car is cold and the outside is warm,2
151218,It's because sometimes on days it can be very hot.,2
150917,"I chose colder than the outside air because it gets really cold over night and it's been there for a week. Even though it in the sun, its a cold day.",2
151190,It will be the same because there is nothing to make it warmer or to make it colder.,2
150921,I don't know.,1
151176,The glass will heat up the car because of the sun rays reflecting through the glass.,3
150918,"I chose this answer because the temperature could not be hot, because it is a cold day.  It also cannot be cold, because it is parked in the sun, so it would be the exact temperature of the outside air.",2
151179,Its Warmer Because The Sun Is Shining On The Car,2
151177,I think that in the sun it heated up a little bit and in the cold air it just cooled it up a little so i think inside the car it would be warm.,2
151174,the air will be warmer because the sun is hitting it,3
151200,I can infer that it is cold in the car because it is a cold day.,2
151196,I think this because hot and cold combined is warm.,2
150907,"The car will collect heat from the sun, causing the air in the car to be  warmer than the air outside because the sun gives of heat, than letting the car become warmer from collecting heat, letting the car become warmer than the cold air outside.",3
150908,I think it is warmer because the sun has been there for 1 week and on the cold day it has only been 1 day.,2
150906,because the car would never be as cold as the outside unless the window was open.,2
150904,the car has been sitting in the sun so the sun would heat up.,3
150903,The metal of his car will get really cold and then that will make the whole car cold.,2
151227,i think its warmer outside air because the sun is outside and it warmes everything,3
151220,"It was a cold day, but it was pretty sunny, so it should be somewhere in the middle.",2
151231,inside a car is almost sealtight.,2
151209,i,1
151230,i think its warmer outside air because the sun is outside and it warmes everything,3
151223,Because the heat is trapped inside.,3
151210,in energi,1
151181,it is exactly the same as the outside air because of condensation.,2
150924,i dont know.,1
151182,it's gonna be cold because the outside temperature will change it if it's hot. if it's a cold day it will turn it cold depending who cold or hot it is outside.,2
151192,The heat outside of the car would be trapped inside of the vehicle for the whole amount of time.,3
151180,because the air goes inside the car.,2
151195,because it is COLD and if the car is parked in the sun it should be WARM and WARM+COLD=normal,2
151199,The heat of the car  would be moe hotter because it would be trapped in side,3
151198,it is warmer because the car was probably heated by the sun,3
151186,The car is the same tempature because it has bin outside and no one has driven it,2
151191,it is in the sun,2
150915,It was parked in a hot place.,2
151178,"I would say that the car would be warmer than the air because even though it is cold, it has been sitting out in the sun for a week, heating it up.",3
151193,the car would be the same temperature in and out side your car.,2
150922,It would be warmer than the outside because it would be heated up by being parked in the sun,3
152218,The car temperature is not same as outside cause car has a door that does not allow the temperature outside be the same as outside and it too has ac.,2
150916,because the heat can get through the window and stay  in there getting hotter.,3
151187,i think it's colder because its been outside for a week and it probably got too cold and wasn't the same temperature.,2
151226,The car is warm a bit in the car because car doors are shut in the car and only a little bit of cold air goes inside.,2
151205,The inside of the car is not exposed to the outside air so it is not as cold as the outside air.,2
151224,It is warmer because all the radiation from the sun is inside the car because the heat got trraped in the car,4
151206,It will be the same because the air in the car is in the same as outside.,2
151203,it will be warmer because the radiation of the sun is transfer inside of the car,3
151214,it depends if its leather it is the same as outside,2
151212,I chose this because the outside would act as a energy consumer and consume energy so the inside of the car can be warmer than the outside.,2
150901,it says on a COLD day then its parked in the sun that's 1-1 then its not been driven for a week making it 2-2 exactly the same as it is outside.,2
150897,because the car will keep its tempature and rise,2
151202,because the air has not been outside and no one has been in side for weeks .,2
151204,if the car  has been in the sun that has not been driven in a week the car is going to be really hot than the weather outside.,2
151207,its because the heat gets trapped in the car.,3
151211,I pick that answer because if it was in the sun for a week then the sun would have reflect on the glass.There for it would make it very hot over time,2
151213,A lot of heat has gotten into the car and the heat can't come out of the car. So a lot of the heat has been trapped in there for a week. That makes the inside even hotter than the outside because for the whole week a lot of heat has been entering the car and cannot get out of there.,3
151188,I think this because since he has't drove this for a long time it gets cold.,2
151201,the temerature is gonna be hotter than outside,2
151189,If it was hot outside than it is going to be hotter inside because the door's are locked and closed and no air.,2
151165,I think  warmer than th outside,2
150920,it will be warmer,2
151228,If is cold outside it has to be warm inside because you're going to be cold inside and that's why it has to be warm inside because maybe you could get sick because it's cold inside.,2
151215,Well the car is the same tempurature because it has been there for a week and i am assuming that because the day he got his car was a cold day the rest of the days were cold days so the tempurature  is the same cold air .,2
151219,I think this because it happened to me,2
151217,the car has been in the sun for a week,2
151221,so it's will be colder as the air outside because it has not been driven for a week and the cold air gathers up and gets even colder.,2
