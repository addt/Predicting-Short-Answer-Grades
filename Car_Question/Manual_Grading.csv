118414.0,the car keeps heat in,2
118580.0,it is warmer because the heat get traped and the heat cant go out and it will get hotter,3
118392.0,well if the car is black in the inside and the sun is out the color black would absorb the heat and stay warm until the sun is goes down,2
139822.0,air has been compacted and radiation may occur due to the sun,3
150109.0,when you are in a car and it is cold outside it will have the same temprature as long as there is no sun like at night,2
153990.0,i think that his car would be colder because it was cold outside and he also has not driven his car in a week and his car kept the cold trapped inside the car,2
139876.0,the air inside the car is warmer than the air outside of the car because the heat is being absorbed by the car,2
154163.0,it a very,2
118344.0,the car will be hotter cause it absorbs the heat from the sun and makes the car hot,2
151209.0,i,1
153827.0,if it was parked out side in the sun the inside of the car would be warm because if cold air is pushing on he car the amount of energy put in to that would make the inside of the car warm,3
118411.0,the sun heats up the car even on a cold day,2
150198.0,the reason i think this is because the car itself has not been driven for a week and we dont know the weather from the day before that which could have been warmer also even if it was a cold day it was still parked in the sun which gives it more heat than what the temprature is outside,2
118341.0,the car has been sitting in warm air for a week the sr and ir will enter and be trapped inside the car,4
118947.0,if the windows are tightly closed then it should be warmer because the sun would heat up the outer shell and it will heat up the inside,2
150204.0,i think it will be exactly the same temperature because it is cold out side and the cold air will be trapped inside the car it will also be cold because it hasn t been turned on in a week so the engine didn t heat the car up,2
153983.0,i say warmer than outside air because the heat can shine through the glass but will be harder to get out so when you get in most of the heat is trapped in and will be hotter,3
136500.0,i chose this answer because the sun is beating down on the car which is creating a warmer temperature then the outside air,2
118440.0,i think it is colder in the car because the coldness comes from the outside air and stays on the out side of the car making the coldness stay inside,2
139526.0,the temperature inside the car will be warmer than the temperature outside because the inside of the car is like an insulator and the there is sunlight being directed at the car the solar radiation will turn into heat as it enters through the glass windshield,4
139739.0,the weather of being inside of a car is warmer because of the radiation that goes on inside which heats up the car itself and makes the heat warmer,3
136511.0,because all the air is trapped inside the car and the sun is shinnying in to the car and heating all the air up an making it hot,3
154124.0,the air is trapped in the car for so long so the air is warmer,2
150167.0,radiation is the heat from the sun and the elctromagnetic waves will absorb through the car,4
154113.0,i think the air on the inside would be warm then the air on the inside then the outside because all of the heat would have stored up in the car and only a little bit of cold air would have been let into the car which would have made the inside of the car warmer then the outside of the car,2
151213.0,a lot of heat has gotten into the car and the heat can t come out of the car so a lot of the heat has been trapped in there for a week that makes the inside even hotter than the outside because for the whole week a lot of heat has been entering the car and cannot get out of there,3
136380.0,the car has been sitting in the sun so it might heat up the car a little bit so it will be hotter than the temperature outside the car,2
136558.0,because the interior can be black and absorb heat and the warm air can get trapped inside the car,3
154321.0,i think the car is warmer then the outside air because it is parked in the sun and has not been driven for a week if the tempature outside is cold and the car is parked in the sun the car will be warmer than the outside air,2
139483.0,the temperature will be the same because hot air that was trapped inside the car will eventually travel to the outside air because hot warm air travels to the cooler temperatures thus the hot air in the car will eventually reach equilibrium,2
136515.0,i think the temperature would be warmer than the outside air because when i get in the car after it sitting in the sun it is hot also because it sits in the sun an heats the car up,2
136399.0,the car is going to get hotter inside then outside air because the heat is trapped in side the car,3
154210.0,it will be warmer than the outside air because the car has been in the sun the car has also not been driven for a week so for a week the car has been in the sun baking,2
153830.0,the sunlight would pass through the windows and the heat from the solar radiation would stay inside the car heating it up if the car had black seats the seats would absorb heat from the outside also the cold air outside would make the outside of the car cold but since the inside is heating up the closed doors wouldn t allow the hot air to escape or the cold air to come in,5
153923.0,i think it will be warmer than the air outside because the air will stay inside and the heat from the sun will warm up the air inside and will cause the air inside to be warmer than the air outside,3
139497.0,i believe that the car is warmer than the outside air because it has been sitting directly in the sun so the air inside of the car should be warmer than the outside air,2
139830.0,over a period of time all of the heat from the sun will hit the metal surrounding the car causing the car to rise up in temperature on the inside of the car,2
136468.0,its going to be the same because every day the temperature changes because one day its cold and one day its hot so at night it starts cooling down then at pm the sun starts to hotter and hotter and eventually the car stars to get hot,2
118531.0,i think this because the heat of the sun shines into the car and then the glass would trap the heat inside of the car making the temperature inside the car hot,3
118446.0,i believe that the air in the car will be colder than the outside air because even though it was parked in the sun for weeks the sun changes position so at night the car will be cold if last night was cold and today is cold that s twice as much time the car has to spend being cold therefore the car air is colder than the air outside,2
150905.0,if it was not in the sun it would be the same as the outside air with the sun transferring energy to the car the car is the warmer than the outside air because the energy is giving heat,4
150054.0,since in is a cold day and his car is parked in the sun i would say the car would be the same as the outside air because the sun makes the car heat up while it is cold,2
139878.0,it s warmer because the air has been stuck inside the car,3
150053.0,because im the morning it would be cold but then as it got hotter the car heated up and it just kept doing that so the car would get so cold it would be the same temperature as the air out side and sme with the heat,2
154118.0,this is a form of conduction the cold is outside is transferred to the car this makes the car cold,2
139847.0,presumably with the windows closed the energy is being retained within the car because its a closed system their isn t any opening for heat to escape from the car,4
139796.0,the heat inside the car has no way out,3
139865.0,the air trapped inside the car would have been able to heat up due to amount of space that is limited so the air would be warmer than the outside,2
118559.0,i dont know,1
139542.0,the car is made of metal and glass as the heat from the sun passes into the car it is absorbed and stored the concentrated sunlight starts heating up the car and it ends up warmer than the outside air,2
139541.0,the material of the car consists of insulators so when radiation from the sun enters the car it will stay in the car it takes a long period of time for the heat to release,4
154152.0,i know that it would be warmer because all the hot air is going inside for a week and none of the air is coming out and just some of the seats stay warm,3
154208.0,the sunlight would have heated the car because he material of the car wold have become very hot,3
136567.0,the car absorbs most of the heat and it depends on the color of the car,2
154157.0,i think the car will be warmer than the outside air i think it will be warmer than the outside air because it been in the sun for a week and if it stays there for a week in the sun it s going to be warmer,2
153905.0,although the air outside the car is cold the radiation from the sun enters the car and has a hard time exiting because the windows makes it more difficult for heat to escape therefor the temperature rises continuously,4
118490.0,i think it will be warmer than outside because if the sun was facing it would get hot inside and the cold air is trapped outside,2
154704.0,after a week in the sun the car is going to be warm because the heat is trapped inside on a cold day the outside temperature would be colder than the car heated up from trapped heat,3
118471.0,the sun is heating up the air inside the car but there is no cold air to cool down the hot air so it only gets hotter,2
139498.0,the heat that was transferred by radiation is trapped inside the car so therefore the air inside the car should be warmer that the air outside on a cold day,4
118552.0,i donot know,1
139800.0,the temperature of the air inside the car is is warmer because solar radiation given from the sun was converted to heat energy it has been in the car for such a long time that it has been kept there,4
139863.0,the cars windows would trap heat inside the car thus keeping the temperature inside the car warmer than the temperature on the outside,3
136410.0,because it is trapping the heat from the sun,2
118305.0,it is warmer because it is parked in the sun and the car must of gotten warm by the sunlight,2
139534.0,the air is warmer because the air inside the car is in an enclosed area and so the heat has nowhere to escape or only less heat is escaping,3
136508.0,i chose warmer than the outside air because the sun is going to the car and the air in the car can t go out so the air in the car will heat up and will make the car warmer,3
139863.0,when akbar left his car out in the sun for a week all the heat from sun shines into the car storing heat inside the car,2
154202.0,because the car was parked for an entire week the car had plenty of time to heat up if the windows were closed,2
154327.0,it would be warmer because the sun would heat up the car then since there is one cold day it still be slightly warmer,2
153994.0,if the sun is shining for a week on a car the heat will probably get trapped in the car it would be muggy or moist in,3
118355.0,the metal on the car warms the inside by radiating heat witch keeps the car warm it also warms the leather since the sun shines through the window strait to the leather,2
150054.0,there still might be heat that goes right through the glass and gets get trapped inside the car,4
118472.0,i think it would be warmer because i m pretty sure that the windows would be closed and the heat would be trapped inside because even though the temp is cold that doesn t mean there isn t a sun outside,3
118444.0,since there is not a lot of sun or radiation in the air to heat up the car the car will stay the same as the outside,3
118554.0,the sun heats up the car so the air is warmer,2
150208.0,i think it will be colder than the outside air because the is sitting in the cold and the cold will get trapped in the car because there is no warm air in the car,2
118310.0,i think it would be warmer than inside because the sun is hitting the car directly so the heat is going to make inside the car hot,2
136464.0,the reason is because his car has been absorbing heat for a whole week which will make his car hot,2
136561.0,because the heat gets trapped in the car and stays like that until fresh outside air gets into he car,2
151176.0,the glass will heat up the car because of the sun rays reflecting through the glass,3
139487.0,from past experiences cars are different temperature from outside because it traps the temperature inside,2
150900.0,it is warmer than the outside air because the glass on the car worked as a conductor and the car was pretty much a solar oven,2
136426.0,it is colder because since it has not been driven for a week there is no energy to make it hotter,2
136572.0,i chose this because the sun has been aiming at the car so the car traps the heat and when it s very hot i go in the car and its very hot inside,3
118415.0,the car would be warmer than the outside air because when it was hot the car would be hot and when akbar comes to the car the heat is still in the car,2
139809.0,the sunlight goes in the car and heats up through radiation,3
118590.0,the car is warmer than the outside air because the suns energy is absorbed by the car so the cars air must be hotter than the air outside of the car,3
136503.0,it would get warmer because the car traps heat in it it also depends on the color of the car,2
153979.0,why is akbar car warm let me tell you akbar s car has been in a sunny spot for a week so the heat build up,2
118546.0,when a car is left not running in the sun the car absorbs the heat and traps it in even in just one day the car can reach temperatures of over degrees furthermore leaving it in the sun for seven days a week everyday will just add on to the heat making it hotter than the outside hair,3
154342.0,i chose the exact same temperature as the outside because from the hot days of the week the car absorbed and trapped the warm air so when it turned cold the heat in he inside turned warm from the mixing of cold and hot air in the inside of the car,2
139536.0,the air inside the car would be heated air from the sun compared to the cold air outside of the car the air the air inside would feel warmer due to being heated by the sun,2
118485.0,well i think that it is warmer than the outside air because it has been there for a week and its sunny outside and the heat from the sun shines into the windows and the car gets hotter,2
154335.0,i think its warmer than the out side because you may have some foarm of heat on and that will help pluss he sun can hit te glass and will go in the car but the heat can not ger out,3
136394.0,the cars air would warmer than the outside air because the heat has been trapped in the car,3
136549.0,i think that the car is hotter than the outside air because we learned in the wise project that when sun light hits an item it absorbs the light and makes it hotter,3
154195.0,the heat energy from the sun will trap itself inside the car and will not escape heating it up this is an example of radiation,4
154215.0,it is warm inside the car because warm air is trapped inside the car and no windows are open,3
136564.0,the outside air would be colder because even though it is a cold day the heat and greenhouse gasses build up in the car and the windows of the car trap the heat in,3
139823.0,overtime the car traps the heat absorbed from the sun therefore increasing the heat inside,3
151227.0,i think its warmer outside air because the sun is outside and it warmes everything,3
136583.0,this is the case because the car traps the heat it gains from the outside,2
153911.0,i have had experience with this it was a saturday and it was very cold the car was parked in the light and it was more colder than the outside air,3
118401.0,because it probably obsorbed the solar energy from the sun so it would stay warm,3
139523.0,the car would be warmer than the outside air because the car is parked outside in the sun where the solar radiation will hit the car through the glass windows and changing into heat and can not escape because the glass reflects the heat energy back in addition the air inside the car is a good insulator where it does not lose the heat at a fast rate,5
118349.0,when its cold ouside and the car traps the coldness then when its gets warm outside the car stays cold,2
154135.0,it will be hotter because it has only been one cold day and there are six other days that are probably hotter than that one cold day and the heat will stay in the car,2
139861.0,it is hotter because the space is limited and the hot air will keep circulating around the car while outside the air has the whole atmosphere to rise up and cool,3
118366.0,the car has been left in the path of solar radiation rays that have been trapped in the car and the solar radiation have transformed into heat,4
154121.0,because it will make solor heat waves,2
139527.0,the warmer because the sun would have provided sunlight or heat to be trapped in the car,3
153925.0,the black absorbs the heat so it gets hotter inside,3
136583.0,this happens because the car trapped the heat from the past week,3
118418.0,i think the answer is it is warmer outside because the sun is warm and when it hits the glass the glass makes the inside hot like a solar oven,2
139518.0,the temperature of the air inside the car will be warmer than outside air because the windows allow heat energy to enter the car but doesn t allow in the heat to escape,4
139801.0,convection will heat up the car from conduction and the conduction is caused by radiation,3
139803.0,even if its a cold day there is still sun shining on the car which heat can go in and because the car has no opening the heat will also be trapped inside which will cause the temperature of the air insdie the car to be warmer than the outside air,3
151199.0,the heat of the car would be moe hotter because it would be trapped in side,3
118413.0,it is warmer because the outside air is cold but the sun is still shining and the heat has been contained for a week,2
136419.0,the heat that was used from the engine was trapped inside the car over night so when the car is opened it is warmer than the outside air,2
139494.0,the temperature of the air inside the car will be warmer than the outside air because if he parked in the sun and has not been driving for a week then the heat inside the car when it is heated by the sun will stay inside even if it is a cold day,3
139524.0,the greenhouse effect will cause the car to be warmer than the outside,2
118586.0,the car is like the solar oven akbar has put his car outside for a week in the sun so the sun s heat is getting in the car,3
139838.0,the air inside the car would be warmer because the sun is directly pointing at the car making the car warmer on the inside compared to the weather outside,2
139509.0,there are heat trapped in the car because the glass traps the heat in the car,3
139515.0,the temperature of the air inside the car is not affected by the wind currents that happen outside the car convection occurs outside which reduces the temperature of air outside the car however the air inside the car is shut off from wind and left to absorb all the heat from the sun s radiation,4
136368.0,i think it is warmer because the heat is trapped in the car and probably doesn t have any windows open so the heat will stay in,3
154141.0,it s going to be warmer inside the car because the sun radiation shines inside the car and the weather will insulate the inside,3
139539.0,it is warmer inside a car than the outside air because heat is being trapped in the inside the car but infrared light is not let out hot air and cold air is trapped inside in a process called convection cold air is going down and hot air is rising,4
150128.0,though the day is cold akbar s car is absorbing radiation from the sun heating it up,4
149960.0,if the car was in the sun then it would heat up the car,3
136456.0,it has had no heat inside of it what so ever in a week causing the inside temperature to keep in the cold air it s had for a week also it maybe could be a little warmer depending on how the car absorbs and reflects heat,2
153999.0,i know this becuse the sun is hot and when the sun hits the the car the car gets really heated and on that day it is cold but the heat is trapped inside,3
153905.0,the air inside the car has been trapped in a metal box which would make air warmer in the car and since it is cold outside that would make the air even warmer in comparison,2
139806.0,i think the temperature of the air inside the car is warmer than the outside because the car is a closed space and the car windows is a good insulator which can trap the heat inside the car,3
150064.0,it s warmer in the car because the air is hot and the cars windows were closed but still air can get in the last time he drove the car the hot air got inside of the car too,3
153823.0,because the sun will heat up the car,2
136555.0,the heat came in through the window and the heat could not come out because the heat reflected from the window,3
118626.0,i think it is warmer than the outside air because the sun is reflecting the car and if it reflects the car it might obsorve or reflect but most likely to obsorve the heat,3
139480.0,the energy from solar radiation has been trapped in the car from the days where it has been sunny and has not escaped the car so the car will be warmer than the outside air,4
154303.0,the car would be warmer than the outside air because even though outside is cold the car was parked in the sun which is a heat source and the sun should heat up the car and the car despite it being cold outside,2
154126.0,because the suns ray is in side the car which is heats up the air around it and the air is warmer then the air outside,4
154199.0,it is warmer because if it has not been driven for a week and the sun shines on it it is heating up the car that would be if the week would be warm and sunny the sun is parked in the sun meaning that the heat waves would go directly into the car,3
118395.0,it will be warmer because the heat inside stays in which makes it hot and the outside air stays the same,3
118450.0,i think the air inside the car would be warmer than the air outside because the car was parked in the sun it absorbed the heat and the cold air and mixed then the air was trapped inside the car not absorbing any air,3
150060.0,even though it is cold outside the heat has been trapped in his car,3
139839.0,the temp inside the car will be warmer than the outside air because of the greenhouse effect since the glass of the car is transparent more energy is absorbed from the sun causing it to be warmer,4
151226.0,it is warmer than the outside air because in the question said akbar parked his car in the sun so it means that its warmer inside the car,2
118401.0,the car obsorbed the suns energy so it would be hot even though its cold outside,3
139513.0,the car is warmer because it traps the heat inside from solar radiation,3
