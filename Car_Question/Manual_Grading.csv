153913.0,because the cars energy is not exactly the same as the air outside,2
139523.0,the car would be warmer than the outside air because the car is parked outside in the sun where the solar radiation will hit the car through the glass windows and changing into heat and can not escape because the glass reflects the heat energy back in addition the air inside the car is a good insulator where it does not lose the heat at a fast rate,5
150109.0,it must be colder than the outside air because all the heat is trapped inside and turns cold because when the temperature outside drops the inside must be cold too,2
139486.0,the reason why the inside of the car gets much warmer than the outside is due to the idea of the green house effect when the trapping of the sun s heat in a planet s or in this situation the cars atmosphere due to the high transparency of the atmosphere to visible radiation from the sun than to infrared radiation emitted from the planet s surface,2
139873.0,the heat has been trapped inside like how the atmosphere traps heat to the earth,3
150108.0,the sun,2
118580.0,the heat goes in to the car when its open and the heat gets trapped in the car and it stays hot inside,2
139481.0,as his car is parked in the sun radiation is traveling inside through the car creating heat energy and is being trapped in there and is increasing for how ever long akbar has left it there,4
136515.0,it would be warmer than outside because a car can trap heat inside if all the windows are up and if the car is a darker color like black it absorbs heat,3
139505.0,radiation from the sun will transfer heat energy from the sun to the car as well as conduction of the heated metal of the car to the air will also heat up the insides of the car however heated air trapped in the car will not be able to escape the car through convection so the air inside the car will be warmer than that of the outside,4
139544.0,the inside of the car would be warmer than the outside air because the warm air released from the sun gets trapped inside the car and stays circulating around the car,3
154138.0,because the air stays in the car and it heats up,2
118589.0,if the car has been sitting in the sun for a week and on that cone cold day when akbar walks to his car the car will most likely be hot because the heat is trapped in the car from the week,3
154308.0,the air will be warmer because the air inside is confined and there outsidse is not the air is much more pressurized,2
150128.0,though the day is cold akbar s car is absorbing radiation from the sun heating it up,4
136483.0,i think it is warmer inside than the outside is because the heat is going to go to the inside of the car to warm up and the outside of the car is on the outside so it is going to be the same temperature as the outside air and the inside is going to be warmer because all the heat is going to be stuck inside roaming around stuck until someone opens it,3
139489.0,i think it is warmer than the outside air because the car probably acts as a greenhouse which traps heat energy emitted from the sun,4
139827.0,the sun is hitting the car directly so the heat is trapped in the car it is not getting out because it is not ventilated,3
150165.0,if the car has been sitting outside in the sun for a whole week and the doors are shut closed and it is hot outside the car will get hotter because when the hot air is shining on the car the car will trap the hot air inside the car and stay there the sun shines through the window and lands on the seats so when you sit down in the car the seats will be very hot,2
151212.0,i chose this because the outside would act as a energy consumer and consume energy so the inside of the car can be warmer than the outside,2
118628.0,it is warmer because it absorbed the heat from the sun and there will still be heat in the car just like the solar ovens,3
118414.0,the car keeps heat in,2
139513.0,the car is warmer because it traps the heat inside from solar radiation,3
154208.0,radiation heats the car and conduction heats the walls of the car convection circulates heat in the car,4
139479.0,based on experience a car is hotter on the inside than it is outside on a hot day the energy that enters the car from the glass will stay trapped in the car the car should be warmer than the outside air,4
141559.0,the reason it will be hotter is because the car has glass leting sunlight inside the car and the longer the sunlight goes in the car the more and more the heat will increase,3
139853.0,it s warmer because it attracts heat so heat will be trapped inside,2
118319.0,it would be warmer because the car would trap the heat inside the car like the solar oven would trap the heat when it was hot out and keep the heat in the car,3
118401.0,the car obsorbed the suns energy so it would be hot even though its cold outside,3
118523.0,,1
136560.0,because the car would trap all the hot air in the car,3
118450.0,i think the air inside the car would be warmer than the air outside because even though the air outside is cold the air inside the car would be warmer because the air was trapped inside the car for a long period of time the warms the air that has been trapped inside,2
139526.0,the temperature inside the car will be warmer than the temperature outside because the inside of the car is like an insulator and the there is sunlight being directed at the car the solar radiation will turn into heat as it enters through the glass windshield,4
136366.0,i said it would be warmer because first off the car could be black and exorb the heat also it would be warmer because solar radiation would hit it hard so sense the car isnt moving all the heat is trapped,4
140712.0,i feel that it would be warmer because the car was sitting for a while week that there was probably still be trapped in the car,2
139516.0,it is going to be warmer the air outside the car because the air inside the car is warm and it gets trapped inside the car,3
139833.0,the radiation from the sun will be trapped inside the car so even if it s a cold day the inside of the car will still be warm,4
118554.0,the car was in the sun so the heat is greater,2
136424.0,it will stay the warmer because the car is made of metal and it will absorb the cold and the light it will be warmer but it wont be very noticeable,3
136489.0,i say that it would be colder than the outside air because since the inside hasn t had much heat absorbed inside of the car also because the car hasn t been turned on in a week no energy has been produced to give out heat,2
140326.0,since it has been parked outside for a week in the sun the car has trapped heat so it will be warmer than the air outside,3
118418.0,i think the answer is it is warmer outside because the sun is warm and when it hits the glass the glass makes the inside hot like a solar oven,2
118521.0,it will be warmer because the hot air from the outside goes into the car and gets trapped so the car will be warmer then the outside air,2
136369.0,the car has been sitting outside in the hot sun for a week so i think that the car has collected lots of heat energy while sitting outside in the sun,3
139866.0,the air or breeze can be a different temperature than the sun light hitting the car i feel like if the car is getting direct sunlight then it will be a different temperature than the outside air or breeze when i read outside air i am thinking about a breeze,3
139545.0,the radiation is sent into the car but the windows keep the heat from escaping which in return traps heat and increases temperature,4
139809.0,the sunlight goes in the car and heats up through radiation,3
139515.0,the temperature of the air inside the car is not affected by the wind currents that happen outside the car convection occurs outside which reduces the temperature of air outside the car however the air inside the car is shut off from wind and left to absorb all the heat from the sun s radiation,4
118614.0,if your car is in the heat then the heat get into the car since there is glass keeping the heat inside the car the car will be hotter than the outside,3
136519.0,it would be warmer because if it was parked outside on a hot day because the sun rays get trapped in the car and turns into heat,5
139480.0,the energy from solar radiation has been trapped in the car from the days where it has been sunny and has not escaped the car so the car will be warmer than the outside air,4
154216.0,it would be warmer because of the sun s radiation from that whlr week,3
139775.0,the warm sun rays get trapped in the car which causes it to be warmer than the outside air,3
136512.0,if his car has been sitting in the sun for a week without being driven then it should be warmer just from sun rays even if the car is white,3
139844.0,the sun will heat up the inside of the car and the temperature will be warmer because the car windows are trapping the heat inside,3
150221.0,i think the car will be warmer than the outside because the heat will get trapped inside the car,3
154321.0,i think the car is warmer than the outside air because with our solar ovens when we tested them in the morning we put a light on them for minutes and it got warmer than the outside air,3
118546.0,when a car is left not running in the sun the car absorbs the heat and traps it in even in just one day the car can reach temperatures of over degrees furthermore leaving it in the sun for seven days a week everyday will just add on to the heat making it hotter than the outside hair,3
154156.0,because if it is cold outside and the car was at sun then the heat and the cold should mix together,2
150916.0,because the heat can get through the window and stay in there getting hotter,3
151194.0,a car can trap all the warm air inside of car resulting in it becoming warmer,3
153832.0,the sun heated the car and the seats leather and other things in the car and like a solar oven it keeps heat in the car so it is hotter than the outside air,3
139537.0,because inside the car the air is trapped and cool air does not go inside the car the mirrors of the car is like the object that heats up the air because the infrared radiation that bouncing back from the surface inside of the car gets reflected back to the interior of the car again causing more heat to be transferred to the air,4
136420.0,if the car has been in the sun the for a week without moving then it is probably hotter than the air around it i say this because maybe the rest of the days that the car has been there were hot and that air went inside the car and is still there so the heat is trapped also maybe the sun being on the car on a cold day keeps the car warmer,2
118552.0,i don t know,1
150905.0,if it was not in the sun it would be the same as the outside air with the sun transferring energy to the car the car is the warmer than the outside air because the energy is giving heat,4
136411.0,because the air gets trapped in and the sun is beating now on the car and it is warming the air inside the car because the air cant escape,3
136404.0,i beleave that the car would be colder then the outside air because the car has windows so the solar energy would reflect on the windows and it might be warm inside the car but not as warm,3
136410.0,because it is trapping the heat from the sun,2
139831.0,the sun heats up the car thus heating the air inside the car up because the car is made of metal and metal easily conducts energy,3
118589.0,if akbar hasn t driven his car for a week and the temperature outside is cold than that day then that means that over a week the car has been sitting in the hot sun and the heat has been trapped,2
139479.0,the car acts as a greenhouse solar radiation enters the car through the windows and the material inside the car will turn that into heat infrared radiation released from the material inside the car will stay in the car because it cannot leave through the windows,5
154218.0,well i think its really cold inside his car because its cold outside and it traps all the cold air into the car and if it was hot then it would be warm in the inside of the car because it would trap the heat in it to,2
118594.0,because if you put your car that you haven t drove for a while then the suns rays well hit the windshield and it will make it warmer,3
139520.0,the temperature of the air inside the car is warmer than the outside air because there is no convection occurring but radiation transfers heat into the car and is trapped inside the car,4
150074.0,it is the same because the air outside is the main source of heat or light it might be hot depending on how much the sun was beaming on the car,4
154319.0,i believe this because when you car is being hit by the sun whether or not it s cold or warm the sun s radiation is being radiated into the glass or plastic they have on the car windows and windshield the car is getting warmer because the radiation is turning into heat energy inside the car and because most cars don t have holes in them the car is just holding in that heat so if its degrees fahrenheit outside but the sun is out and hitting the car the car will most likely be warmer like degrees fahrenheit that is why i believe the car would be warmer than the outside after a week of being hit by the sun,5
118529.0,it is warmer because since it was parked out in the sun for a week the car is heated and unlike out side it was one day it was out in the cold so the radiation inside there is a lot,3
153835.0,the car will be colder than the air outside because the engine has not been run for a week so the car will not have any source of energy to heat the car up,2
154333.0,i think that the car will be warmer than the air outside because the air inside the car is trapped inside and with the sun beating down for weeks and the parts inside the car like the seats and etc absorb the heat,4
118579.0,it is warmer because the car traps the heat which keeps it warm,3
150241.0,i chose the second one because there might have been hotter days and the radiation from the sun would heat the car up even when it is cold,3
118513.0,it is warmer because it has been absorbing sunlight and it traps the heat inside,4
136561.0,once the heat gets in it get trapped in there building up greater temperature inside than outside,3
118531.0,i think this because the heat of the sun shines into the car and then the glass would trap the heat inside of the car making the temperature inside the car hot,3
139506.0,since the car is in the sun all the heat gets absorbed into the car and heat gets trapped so it allows it to be a really high temperature,3
118586.0,the car is like the solar oven akbar has put his car outside for a week in the sun so the sun s heat is getting in the car,3
153864.0,it s warmer then the outside because outside the car there is wind and has probably changed weather several times where inside the car it doesn t release air so that it stays the same temperature until it gets hot and then in the car it gets warmer,2
118313.0,the car will absorb sunlight radiation and will heat up the car more than the outside air,3
139865.0,the air trapped inside the car would have been able to heat up due to amount of space that is limited so the air would be warmer than the outside,2
154323.0,it get hotter because heat will come through the glass and cant escape so the car heats up,3
150123.0,even though it is a cold day a week before it might been a warm day and the heat is trapped inside the car since it hasn t been driven for a week,3
151222.0,there are many various reasons why people choose their answers the reason i chose my answer is because if you were to leave your car in the cold or in the shade the inside of your car would get cold how thats a great question well my answer is that it s radiation it would be more likely caused from the electromagnetic waves,3
155334.0,because the heat is going in the car and making it hotter inside than it is outside,2
118444.0,since there is not a lot of sun or radiation in the air to heat up the car the car will stay the same as the outside,3
136460.0,depending on the windows in the car the heat will go through the window and not reflect if it goes through and you have no sunshade your car will be warmer than outside it s warmer because now the heat has no wear to go and is trapped in your car,3
153923.0,the radiation of the sun will heat up the car,4
139816.0,most cars are metal the cold air coming in contact with the car s temperature meets equilibrium with the temperature outside eventually the temp of the car will effect the temp inside with the help of the glass windows and sealed doors the cold air doesn t leave the car,2
150077.0,his car is parked in the sun and has not been driven for a week the radiation from the sun goes into the car and heats up it will be really hot in the car since he didn t drive it in a week if he had a reflector on the front and back windows of his car then it wouldn t be so hot,4
136481.0,the car is like a greenhouse but it doesn t have all of the plants in it the hot air transferred into the car and kept getting warmer and more hot air because of the sun,3
153918.0,since were making solar ovens i would think the temperature is warmer,2
139798.0,it is warmer inside the car than outside because the heat has been inside the car for a long time,2
150100.0,the reason i chose this awnser is because when you leave something outside and then cold comes all the heat escapes from the car and it is left cold,2
154121.0,because it will make solor heat waves,2
