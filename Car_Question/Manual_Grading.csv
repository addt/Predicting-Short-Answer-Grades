139536.0,the materials the car is made out of will allow radiation to go into the car and turn into heat the heat that is inside the car will not be able to be released due to the cars materials be insulators,5
150900.0,it is warmer than the outside air because the glass on the car worked as a conductor and the car was pretty much a solar oven,2
154113.0,because the car would be like a big solar oven and all of the heat just stay in there and everyday the car would just keep getting warmer and warmer and warmer it moves to a different place where it s not that warm,3
139556.0,the heat cannot escape from the car so the heat stays inside and stays warm,3
139521.0,the car has glass that is similar to the atmosphere the solar radiation is able to go through the glass and stored as heat in the car and the infrared radiation is reflect back to the car and covert back to heat this allow the car to store heat inside and have a warmer temperature than the outside air,5
136546.0,the car is made of materials that will take and trap heat which makes the car hotter,2
139643.0,the solar radiation from the sun enters the car and becomes heat which is trapped by the glass thus the inside will be warmer,5
153913.0,the temperature is warmer because the car isn t the same as outside air it a little warmer cause the car s energy,2
153837.0,i think the car is colder than the outside because if it s a cold day and the car hasn t been driven for a week the engine would be at a freezing temperature and the only heat it would get would be the little amount of sunlight there is on a cold day,3
139866.0,the air or breeze can be a different temperature than the sun light hitting the car i feel like if the car is getting direct sunlight then it will be a different temperature than the outside air or breeze when i read outside air i am thinking about a breeze,3
139517.0,even though the day is cold it is in the sun so the solar rays will go into his car and become heat inside the car,3
139785.0,the air trapped in the car does not escape and reach equilibrium with the air outside but instead it is warmer than the air outside because the heat is trapped in the car,2
153837.0,if it s a cold day and the car hasn t been used for a week during the night it would be really cold so for seven days if it s just sitting there it would be colder than outside just because there s a little sunlight it still can t heat it up that much,3
136380.0,the temperature all week was probably not cold the sun still shined through the clouds and traps it insides making is car a little warmer,2
,nan,1
139524.0,the greenhouse effect will cause the car to be warmer than the outside,2
139856.0,the temperature of the air inside the car would be warmer than the outside air because the car is parked in the sun therefore the car is absorbing the sun s heat,2
118364.0,because i think the air would be trapped inside the car and get warmer,2
139816.0,nan,1
150163.0,the car is warmer because of the heat trapped in the car from a few days ago,2
150069.0,i chose this answer because the sun is going into the car radiation is happening,3
139778.0,the car is placed outdoors causing the heat of the car and the air to mix causing the temperature to be the same,2
139542.0,the car is made of metal and glass as the heat from the sun passes into the car it is absorbed and stored the concentrated sunlight starts heating up the car and it ends up warmer than the outside air,2
136426.0,it is colder because since it has not been driven for a week there is no energy to make it hotter,2
118539.0,the hot air gets trapped in the car,2
118611.0,nan,1
136368.0,i think it is warmer because the heat is trapped in the car and probably doesn t have any windows open so the heat will stay in,3
139848.0,nan,1
118462.0,it will be warmer because the sun was on the car for a week and the solar car trapped the suns energy and it is hearing the car naturally,3
136411.0,because the air gets trapped in and the sun is beating now on the car and it is warming the air inside the car because the air cant escape,3
139824.0,the car has different materials so the cold air outside will be trapped into the car,2
136517.0,i think this because heat can radiate in through windows but cannot radiate out so it gets hot,3
154200.0,the car hasn t been driven for a week so the car will absorb the energy of the car but also absorb the coldness too,3
136559.0,i think it would be warmer then the outside air because the outside of the car is medal so it would get hotter on the inside because the heat would leak into the car,2
153864.0,it s going to be a different temperature inside the car as the compared outside because in the car it will keep all the warm air inside,3
154114.0,i think that it would be warmer because if it was sunny the day he parked it the sun would be trapped in if he didn t drive it for a week and the day he uses it its cold it would still be warm,3
150108.0,warmer,2
139480.0,the energy from solar radiation has been trapped in the car from the days where it has been sunny and has not escaped the car so the car will be warmer than the outside air,4
149588.0,warmer because the cold is not going in the car and heat transfers into cold,2
139802.0,its been sitting in the sun for a week and so the car will absorb the heat and trap it in the car,3
139528.0,nan,1
136409.0,the heat from the sun gets trapped inside the car which makes the car hotter than the outside,2
118443.0,the air inside the car would be colder because the solar radiation might have reflected off the car from the paint and the air around the car is cold too,3
151224.0,it will be warmer because the sunlight from the sun gets trapped in the car causing heat keeping the car warm the whole week,4
150223.0,the car is parked in the sun and he hasn t driven the car for a week and even though it s cold outside the sun is still heating up the car this is an example of radiation,3
150240.0,the car has been parked outside for a week in the sun so the sunlight has probably gone through the windows and the heat has been trapped in the car it is cold outside but the car has been parked in sunlight for so long the inside of the car must me warmer than the outside,4
139482.0,the air inside the car would be warmer than the outside air because the car is an enclosed environment so it cannot mix with the cold air outside and since the sun is giving off heat in the form of radiation the car s outer walls absorb energy and windows allow radiation to heat up the seats in the car all this is trapped more or less inside the car making the air hotter than the outside air,4
118444.0,since there is not a lot of sun or radiation in the air to heat up the car the car will stay the same as the outside,3
153830.0,the sunlight would pass through the windows and the heat from the solar radiation would stay inside the car heating it up if the car had black seats the seats would absorb heat from the outside also the cold air outside would make the outside of the car cold but since the inside is heating up the closed doors wouldn t allow the hot air to escape or the cold air to come in,5
153818.0,the temperature of the day will be the temperature of the car with no outside factors however the sun will heat the car and the air in the faster than the sun can heat the entire atmosphere of the earth therefore the air inside the car will be hotter than outside the question below doesn t make very much sense how would i know what affected the cars temperature the most the answer is obviously to me either the sun or the air outside the car but i have now idea which it s hard for me to explain something like this so much goes on in my brain thinking through the problem so i can t put everything i think of and so if i jump around in my answer that would be why,2
154333.0,i think that the car will be warmer than the air outside because the air inside the car is trapped inside and with the sun beating down for weeks and the parts inside the car like the seats and etc absorb the heat,4
139479.0,based on experience a car is hotter on the inside than it is outside on a hot day the energy that enters the car from the glass will stay trapped in the car the car should be warmer than the outside air,4
150089.0,i think it is going to be warmer in the car then outside because when it once was warm and so the warm air in the car stays in there because warm air moves and cold air stays in place so when it is cold outside the air stays cold and the warm air in the car stays warm,2
139535.0,the space in the car will be warmer because the radiation will convert into heat and be detained in the car collecting heat until the air inside is warmer than the air outside,5
139818.0,the inside would be warmer because sunlight would be trapped inside which would heat up the inside,4
139495.0,the car collects and traps the air inside by the greenhouse effect where the cold air can t escape,3
118341.0,the heat trapped inside the car rises to the top and can t escape while the cold air sinks to the bottom,2
139477.0,the temperature of the inside of akbar s car is warmer because the heat has been trapped inside from it being parked in the sun radiation enters the car but it gets trapped like the greenhouse effect and heat stays in also with the dark car it absorbs light even more,4
150133.0,it is warmer that the outside because if you were to leave a car in the sun for a long time then the sun will shine solar radiation on the windshield and then the inside of the car will attract then heat and stay like that,5
118366.0,the car has been left in the path of solar radiation rays that have been trapped in the car and the solar radiation have transformed into heat,4
139827.0,the sun is reflectiing into the car and the heat is not escaping,3
151192.0,the heat outside of the car would be trapped inside of the vehicle for the whole amount of time,3
154342.0,i chose the exact same temperature as the outside because from the hot days of the week the car absorbed and trapped the warm air so when it turned cold the heat in he inside turned warm from the mixing of cold and hot air in the inside of the car,2
150204.0,i think it will be exactly the same temperature because it is cold out side and the cold air will be trapped inside the car it will also be cold because it hasn t been turned on in a week so the engine didn t heat the car up,2
154327.0,it would be warmer because the sun would heat up the car then since there is one cold day it still be slightly warmer,2
118463.0,because the car traps the heat in the car,3
139516.0,it is going to be warmer the air outside the car because the air inside the car is warm and it gets trapped inside the car,3
154303.0,a car is warmer than outside air because since the car has been off for a while during that time period it has absorbed heat also the car has not been moving so there is no circulation in the car to make it cooler as well as the car trapping the absorbed heat because there is no patch for escape therefor a car cannot be cooler than outside,4
139561.0,because the radiation from the sun can keep the car warm,3
154156.0,because if it is cold outside and the car was at sun then the heat and the cold should mix together,2
139520.0,the temperature of the air inside the car is warmer than the outside air because there is no convection occurring but radiation transfers heat into the car and is trapped inside the car,4
139849.0,nan,1
149972.0,a car like a solar oven works like a greenhouse trapping heat that will make it hotter than the outside air even on a cold day because there is still hear coming from the sun,4
118362.0,nan,1
150200.0,i think this because when the sun goes inside the car most of the time the heat gets trapped inside the car,4
136561.0,once the heat gets in it get trapped in there building up greater temperature inside than outside,3
118616.0,i predicted that the inside of the motor hasn t been used and is outside in the hot weather that will cause the car to get warmer and heat up,2
118439.0,it is warmer because the heat from the sun penetrates and makes the car warm another reason is cold air does not penetrate glass and the sun does for example when you put a magnifying glass to wood and the sun is facing the wood it burns the wood because of the glass,2
118607.0,the coldness from outside makes the car cool and the cold gets trapped in the car making it cooler,2
154319.0,i believe this because when you car is being hit by the sun whether or not it s cold or warm the sun s radiation is being radiated into the glass or plastic they have on the car windows and windshield the car is getting warmer because the radiation is turning into heat energy inside the car and because most cars don t have holes in them the car is just holding in that heat so if its degrees fahrenheit outside but the sun is out and hitting the car the car will most likely be warmer like degrees fahrenheit that is why i believe the car would be warmer than the outside after a week of being hit by the sun,5
118544.0,it would be warmer than the outside air because the air is trapped inside the car and the heat through the glass warms the air in the car and since the air is trapped it cant escape and it just gets hotter and hottwe,3
118616.0,i predicted colder than the outside air because the car has not been driven for a week and it is a cold day the temperature of the cold air leads energy into the car,2
136494.0,the temperature inside the car would be warmer than the outside air because since it s been in the sun for a week the car would ve absorbed all the heat and reflected the cold air,2
139826.0,the air in the car is warmer than the air outside because it has been contained in the same space for a longer period of time the rays from the sun has been keeping the air inside warm even through the cold the air is more contained and given heat through the sun s rays,4
154214.0,the suns rays have been hitting the car for a week so it will be warmer than the outside air,3
139527.0,the warmer because the sun would have provided sunlight or heat to be trapped in the car,3
136450.0,the metal of the car will keep in the heat that has already been in it,2
154125.0,because the car traps the heat,3
150921.0,i don t know,1
139505.0,radiation from the sun will transfer heat energy from the sun to the car as well as conduction of the heated metal of the car to the air will also heat up the insides of the car however heated air trapped in the car will not be able to escape the car through convection so the air inside the car will be warmer than that of the outside,4
118510.0,because heat gets trapped in the materials and kept in through the glass but at the same time when i get in the car in the morning its colder so i m confused,3
150196.0,rr,1
118345.0,that is my answer because it has t bean opened so no colb air got in,2
118413.0,it is warmer because the outside air is cold but the sun is still shining and the heat has been contained for a week,2
139527.0,the window allows heat energy to enter the car and doesn t allow it to escape,4
139796.0,nan,1
139493.0,the heat is trapped within the car and the heat is unable to escape the car causing the interior of the car to be warmer than the outside of the car,3
139881.0,nan,1
136496.0,warmer because the heat from the sun is heating up the car,2
139863.0,when akbar left his car out in the sun for a week all the heat from sun shines into the car storing heat inside the car,2
151194.0,a car can trap all the warm air inside of car resulting in it becoming warmer,3
118304.0,the sun produces solar radiation which heats up the car and the infrared radiation gets trapped in the car which leads to the temperature rising,5
153832.0,the sun heated the car and the seats leather and other things in the car and like a solar oven it keeps heat in the car so it is hotter than the outside air,3
155334.0,because the heat is going in the car and making it hotter inside than it is outside,2
154703.0,because if it was sitting there on a hot day all the sun radiation and heat would get traped inide,4
118369.0,nan,1
139510.0,some of the heat from the sunlight is trapped inside the car therefore it should be warmer since the outside is cold,3
139854.0,nan,1
139492.0,the glass from the windows of the car traps heat inside the car which makes it warmer than the outside air,3
118458.0,the car has only kept the heat and not the solar radiation,4
136576.0,i think that the car would be warmer inside because in a car there aren t much places to get cold air in but if the windshield is wide open and the sun is hitting it and not much air is coming in then the sun will heat it up because once the hot air comes in then most of it stays in and if it stays in then when more hot air comes in it will get hotter and hotter,3
118536.0,the energy was stored from the weather when akbar closed his door,2
136550.0,it should be warmer it depends on the other days and the sun position if it was hot on other days then it was most likely warmer then the outside air also if the sun was directly on the car it would be hot from the light one last thing is how small the car is it traps in a lot of heat which moves around in that small space which makes it hotter,3
