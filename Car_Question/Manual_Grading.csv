118624.0,i chose this answer because if the sun has been shining on the car for a week the sun has just shone its light on the car not in the car this means that the top of the car is warmer not the inner part of the car,3
139545.0,warmer because heat gets trapped in the car meaning that temperature would increase,3
118465.0,the air has zero reflectivity so it absorbs more solar radiation than the car which has a reflective metal surface,3
136505.0,i think it is warmer because the light from the sun goes onto the windshield which projects the light from the sun into the car which makes the car hotter than the outside air making the car hotter it was before,3
153908.0,i think it would be a little warmer because it would trap air in the car and the little sun it would get will get it a little warm,3
118513.0,it is warmer because it has been absorbing sunlight and it traps the heat inside,4
118539.0,the hot air gets trapped in the car or they have the heater on in the car,2
118360.0,i dont know,1
154151.0,dont,1
153919.0,i think it will be warmer because like the plastic wrap and plexiglass the radiation will go through the windsheild and the glass in the windsheild would keep the heat inside of the car,4
154157.0,i think the car will be warmer than the outside air i think it will be warmer than the outside air because it been in the sun for a week and if it stays there for a week in the sun it s going to be warmer,2
153990.0,i think that his car would be colder because it was cold outside and he also has not driven his car in a week and his car kept the cold trapped inside the car,2
118440.0,it depends on the weather if it is cold outside then it will be really cold inside the car because when it is cold outside the coldness will go inside the car and stay in there and it might also fog up the mirrors if it is hot outside the heat will also heat the car on the outside making the heat go in the inside and heats it up and makes it warmer inside then it is outsiede,2
151207.0,its because the heat gets trapped in the car,3
139856.0,the temperature of the air inside the car would be warmer than the outside air because the car is parked in the sun therefore the car is absorbing the sun s heat,2
150204.0,i think it will be exactly the same temperature because it is cold out side and the cold air will be trapped inside the car it will also be cold because it hasn t been turned on in a week so the engine didn t heat the car up,2
139826.0,the air in the car is warmer than the air outside because it has been contained in the same space for a longer period of time the rays from the sun has been keeping the air inside warm even through the cold the air is more contained and given heat through the sun s rays,4
139526.0,the temperature inside the car will be warmer than the temperature outside because the inside of the car is like an insulator and the there is sunlight being directed at the car the solar radiation will turn into heat as it enters through the glass windshield,4
150171.0,i think it s colder inside the car because the cold air got in side and the car hasn t been driven for a week,2
139785.0,the air trapped in the car does not escape and reach equilibrium with the air outside but instead it is warmer than the air outside because the heat is trapped in the car,2
154304.0,i think this because the car will trap the cold inside the car and keep the car cold,2
118418.0,it is the same because there is no heat to warm it up except the sun that would keep it the same temperature,2
154131.0,i think this because the car was outside for a week and the sun could of sent heat waves and the heat could have been trapped in the car,3
118544.0,it would be warmer than the outside air because the air is trapped inside the car and the heat through the glass warms the air in the car and since the air is trapped it cant escape and it just gets hotter and hottwe,3
139482.0,the windows allow the sunlight to get in the car while it traps heat in the car the air is an isolated from the outside so the air inside would be warmer than the surrounding,4
136455.0,the air has been trapped in this car for a week in the sun making it warmer than weather temperature,2
136419.0,the heat from the sun has been trapped inside the car thus the air inside the car is warmer then than the air outside,2
118552.0,i don t know,1
139523.0,the car would be warmer than the outside air because the car is parked outside in the sun where the solar radiation will hit the car through the glass windows and changing into heat and can not escape because the glass reflects the heat energy back in addition the air inside the car is a good insulator where it does not lose the heat at a fast rate,5
136380.0,the temperature all week was probably not cold the sun still shined through the clouds and traps it insides making is car a little warmer,2
139513.0,the car is warmer because it traps the heat inside from solar radiation,3
150243.0,i think that it is warmer than the inside than it is outside because the car traps heat inside when it is under the sun,3
136417.0,i think it will be exactly the same because it can get inside by the heat ace vent and be the same as the outside air,2
139809.0,light enters the car and is absorbed as heat in the cars inner surfaces,3
150137.0,the car will be warm due to the radiation and the heat so the inside of the car will get warmer than the outside especially since it has been in the sun for a week,3
139797.0,the temperature inside the car will be warmer than the air outside of the car because the air is being trapped inside the car therefore it will just increase in heat accordingly towards the temperature outside of the car,3
139880.0,nan,1
139489.0,i think it is warmer than the outside air because the car probably acts as a greenhouse which traps heat energy emitted from the sun,4
118472.0,i think it would be warmer because i m pretty sure that the windows would be closed and the heat would be trapped inside because even though the temp is cold that doesn t mean there isn t a sun outside,3
151199.0,the heat of the car would be moe hotter because it would be trapped in side,3
139833.0,the radiation from the sun will be trapped inside the car so even if it s a cold day the inside of the car will still be warm,4
118552.0,i donot know,1
154135.0,i think the air in the car will be warmer than the outside air because it has been outside and there is no where for the air t go so it starts getting warmer because of the sun heating up the car with the air trapped in side,3
150060.0,even though it is cold outside the heat has been trapped in his car,3
149972.0,a car like a solar oven works like a greenhouse trapping heat that will make it hotter than the outside air even on a cold day because there is still hear coming from the sun,4
150054.0,there still might be heat that goes right through the glass and gets get trapped inside the car,4
139881.0,warmer because it had been parked in the sun and the cold temperature is not going inside the car,2
153864.0,it s going to be a different temperature inside the car as the compared outside because in the car it will keep all the warm air inside,3
154202.0,because the car was parked for an entire week the car had plenty of time to heat up if the windows were closed,2
154218.0,well i think its really cold inside his car because its cold outside and it traps all the cold air into the car and if it was hot then it would be warm in the inside of the car because it would trap the heat in it to,2
150909.0,because if there is sun reflecting on the car it will heat up the car so the car will be hotter than the outside air,3
154195.0,the heat energy from the sun will trap itself inside the car and will not escape heating it up this is an example of radiation,4
153987.0,i think a car is warmer becuse the sun face the glass on a car and that is how it keeps it warm,2
136368.0,well if you have all the windows closed and you have been in the sun all week it would be hotter because all the hot air from the sun would be trapped in the car since it was a cold day that day he got to his car it wouldn t be as hot on warmer days,2
150165.0,if it is warm outside and the car has been sitting there a week the suns light has been beating onto the car and the car has medal so the seats inside the car and and outside of the car will attract the sun and the car will eventullay get hotter and hotter,3
140326.0,since it has been parked outside for a week in the sun the car has trapped heat so it will be warmer than the air outside,3
136518.0,the temperature of the air inside the car is warmer than the outside air because all thee air is trapped inside of the car the cars engine heating up from use could change the temperature inside the car a little it also could be because the metal on the car gets heated by the sun which affects the temperature in the car a lot,2
118303.0,the inside has trapped solar radiation heat in the car for a week through the window,3
151217.0,i do not know,1
139509.0,there are heat trapped in the car because the glass traps the heat in the car,3
150090.0,because i ve had exeperience with this when you havnt drove your car in a while and its hot outside it will be more hot in the car thats why you should not keep dogs in the car on hot days,2
139768.0,cars are usually dark inside and could have the heater be lingering from it being last used and that it absorbs the sunlight it can get,3
139806.0,because the sunlight passes through the glass and turn to heat and also glass is a good insulator which can trap the heat inside the car,5
139876.0,the air inside the car is warmer than the air outside of the car because the heat is being absorbed by the car,2
151223.0,because the heat is trapped inside,3
150907.0,the car will collect heat from the sun causing the air in the car to be warmer than the air outside because the sun gives of heat than letting the car become warmer from collecting heat letting the car become warmer than the cold air outside,3
136559.0,i chose warmer than the outside air because the glass heats up and it makes the whole car hotter even if there wasn t a lot of sunlight,3
153911.0,i have had experience with this it was a saturday and it was very cold the car was parked in the light and it was more colder than the outside air,3
139836.0,the temperature of the air inside the car is warmer than the outside air because no outside air can penetrate through while the car is closed which traps the heat inside your car,3
150228.0,the hot air has been stuck there for a long,2
139539.0,it is warmer inside a car than the outside air because heat is being trapped in the inside the car but infrared light is not let out hot air and cold air is trapped inside in a process called convection cold air is going down and hot air is rising,4
139543.0,this is because since the car has its own atmosphere due to its materials and locked circulation if its cold outside the cold would be trapped inside the car,2
139537.0,because the air inside the car will be heated up by the sun and since there is no fresh air coming in the car convection will not occur and the car will be hot inside,3
139544.0,the inside of the car would be warmer than the outside air because the warm air released from the sun gets trapped inside the car and stays circulating around the car,3
154306.0,the heat is being trapped inside from the last time he went inside his car if his car color is black or a dark color the car woul,3
139798.0,since the heat was trapped inside the car it will feel hotter inside than the air outside,3
136519.0,it would be warmer because if it was parked outside on a hot day because the sun rays get trapped in the car and turns into heat,5
150131.0,it would be hotter because there would be the warm air from the week before plus the most recent temperatures,2
150905.0,if it was not in the sun it would be the same as the outside air with the sun transferring energy to the car the car is the warmer than the outside air because the energy is giving heat,4
150900.0,it is warmer than the outside air because the glass on the car worked as a conductor and the car was pretty much a solar oven,2
151192.0,a car can trap all of the warm air inside of the car resulting in it becoming warmer,3
136421.0,the energy from the sun goes into the car and turns into heat it then stays in the car and the car gets hotter,5
139643.0,the inside of the car will be warmer because the energy from the sun will become trapped inside the car due to the glass windows,4
154134.0,it would be warmer because the air is trapped inside the car and it can t have any contact with the cold outside air,2
136416.0,the heat is being trapped inside of the car then coiling up that heat until it can be released,3
136559.0,i think it would be warmer then the outside air because the outside of the car is medal so it would get hotter on the inside because the heat would leak into the car,2
154846.0,i think the air outside will be warmer than the outside air because it had the sun going through the window for a week with all doors shut and no way of the hot air getting out,2
139818.0,the inside would be warmer because sunlight would be trapped inside which would heat up the inside,4
151230.0,i think its warmer outside air because the sun is outside and it warmes everything,3
150222.0,when your car is parked outside and it is a cold day then i m guessing it s cold at night so then the cold just keeps on coming,2
153981.0,since the car hasn t been driven for a week there is a lack of body heat inside the car also the engine hasn t been running for a while and that gives off heat to the car finally i have evidence from my personal life when i go on a week long trip to anywhere i leave my car in a parking lot so that it doesn t get stolen when my family and i get back from our trip our car is cold even though it has been sitting in the sun all week just because it was a cold morning night,2
118579.0,it is warmer because the car traps the heat which keeps it warm,3
136546.0,the car is made of materials that will take and trap heat which makes the car hotter,2
118313.0,if it is in the sun the heat goes directly towards it and keeps it warm,2
139488.0,it should be warmer inside the car because like the solar oven the car should retain some of the the heat that enters the car,3
139536.0,the materials the car is made out of will allow radiation to go into the car and turn into heat the heat that is inside the car will not be able to be released due to the cars materials be insulators,5
136424.0,it will stay the warmer because the car is made of metal and it will absorb the cold and the light it will be warmer but it wont be very noticeable,3
150241.0,i chose the second one because there might have been hotter days and the radiation from the sun would heat the car up even when it is cold,3
139527.0,the window allows heat energy to enter the car and doesn t allow it to escape,4
154126.0,because the suns ray is in side the car which is heats up the air around it and the air is warmer then the air outside,4
136456.0,it has had no heat inside of it what so ever in a week causing the inside temperature to keep in the cold air it s had for a week also it maybe could be a little warmer depending on how the car absorbs and reflects heat,2
136515.0,it would be warmer than outside because a car can trap heat inside if all the windows are up and if the car is a darker color like black it absorbs heat,3
136453.0,since the day is cold the car had not heat to absorb keeping the same temperature as the outside,2
139527.0,the warmer because the sun would have provided sunlight or heat to be trapped in the car,3
136461.0,the light has been reflecting off the car for a week and it has not been being adsorbed to the inside making the air outside hotter,3
150103.0,weather can vary from day to day that day the weather happens to be cold but we don t know what the weather was like on the first day akbar parked his car in the sun since akbar didn t drive his car from that day on for a week we can infer that the original temperature of the car is still trapped inside but then again there is the weather for the rest of the week but most cars are constructed so that no hot air can escape or any cold air can come in,2
118393.0,it is warmer than the outside air because the sun is powerful and the car was parked in the sun the car aborsed the heat and the glass would let out a little of that heat and the rest would stay inside,3
139521.0,the car absorb heat that came from the sun through radiation through out the week the cover of the car serve as a insulator that store the heat in the car in a cold day the cold through convection only affect the surface of the car but not the air inside of the car,3
136394.0,the cars air would warmer than the outside air because the heat has been trapped in the car,3
153999.0,i know this becuse the sun is hot and when the sun hits the the car the car gets really heated and on that day it is cold but the heat is trapped inside,3
151192.0,the heat outside of the car would be trapped inside of the vehicle for the whole amount of time,3
118510.0,because heat gets trapped in the materials and kept in through the glass but at the same time when i get in the car in the morning its colder so i m confused,3
118369.0,nan,1
118464.0,it is warmer because the sun is hitting the car it is just a little bit warmer,2
154319.0,i believe this because when you car is being hit by the sun whether or not it s cold or warm the sun s radiation is being radiated into the glass or plastic they have on the car windows and windshield the car is getting warmer because the radiation is turning into heat energy inside the car and because most cars don t have holes in them the car is just holding in that heat so if its degrees fahrenheit outside but the sun is out and hitting the car the car will most likely be warmer like degrees fahrenheit that is why i believe the car would be warmer than the outside after a week of being hit by the sun,5
,nan,1
136550.0,it should be warmer it depends on the other days and the sun position if it was hot on other days then it was most likely warmer then the outside air also if the sun was directly on the car it would be hot from the light one last thing is how small the car is it traps in a lot of heat which moves around in that small space which makes it hotter,3
118447.0,it would be warmer because the car is keeping the heat on the inside,2
136402.0,all of the heat will go into the car all that heat that went in the car will stay in the car unless the window is open,3
139479.0,the car acts as a greenhouse solar radiation enters the car through the windows and the material inside the car will turn that into heat infrared radiation released from the material inside the car will stay in the car because it cannot leave through the windows,5
139881.0,nan,1
139809.0,the sunlight goes in the car and heats up through radiation,3
118588.0,because the windows only keep physical things out but is a entrance for heat or cold,2
136368.0,i think it is warmer because the heat is trapped in the car and probably doesn t have any windows open so the heat will stay in,3
118437.0,since the car was left outside for a while the hot air probly got trapped in there,2
