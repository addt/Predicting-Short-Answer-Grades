153977,One important decision is that it might have to have an opening (Of course it does) for the sun to get in to grow to tomatoes. And you might want to grow less tomatoes so it is not as compact.,3
153978,"You need to figure out what material you're going to use to make the structure, the size, where the garden is, and the placement of the sun. If the sun is higher it might bring more heat. If the garden is somewhere where it snows or has other extreme weather, the tomatoes might not grow as fast.",3
153979,1. you can grow 2 tomatoes  in a well cared for green house. 2.water them different times a day  and see which one grows faster then do that with both fruits 3.keep alarms and track when  you watered  them and how.,2
153980,"Some important decisions I will need to make is putting a thermometer in, solar panels that create electricity, and put in heaters.",2
153981,"You will need to have a wide enough entrance for the sun rays to travel into the structure. Also, you will need to make sure that the heat doesn't leave the enclosed space, since we need as much as heat possible in the cold winter.",4
153982,I think that yo need water and sunlight for tomatoes to grow properly.,3
153983,important decisions you will need to make are where is your structure going to be located and how much heat there is in that place.These decisions will have an effect the amount of energy that enters and leaves the structure because you need to have a place where there is enough heat for the tomatoes to grow.,3
153984,maybe have solar panels or a green house.,2
153985,YES BECAUSE YES,1
153987,i think it will take the air out becsaus it can take the air out,2
153988,how much will this structure cost the community garden? what should we build ?,2
153989,"What decisions I would need to make would be, how were going to get heat and what temperature tomatoes grow best in. These decisions would affect the amount of energy in the build because if our heating takes a lot of energy we couldn't have lights in the build.",3
153990,As a plan i would build a green house to protect the tomatoes. This would make an impact by protecting and keeping the tomatoes warm and protected.,2
153991,To make an impact you would need to use glass to get the sun in and put in generators outside to power the heaters to keep the plants warm and to help go against the cold outside.,3
153992,You will need a strure,2
153993,It is important because if the tempature and all the other stuff arent right the project won't work.,2
153994,Some decisions you might need to make would be the height and width (size) of the structure and what materials to use as the roof to let sun in.,3
153996,You will need to plan and built a structure for the tomatoes using wood for the structure and the temperature should be around 75 to 80 because if its to warm or to cold they might not grow.,3
153997,you will need to make it hot in the the structure because it needs to be hot but you need water to help it grow so you have to put water in it,2
153999,"You need to know how much light, how tall and how long becuse the hight and langhth changes the heat.",4
154000,i plan to  build the structure small and wide because the question on 1.2 showed that the small and wide heats up faster,2
154026,"You will want to make a green house so that the heat gets trapped in and the plant will grow better.  This will effect the amount of energy leaving the green house because, you want to trap the heat in there so that they will grow faster.",4
154107,"be Important decisions I need to make are how big should the structure be, draw it to see how I want to make it, and how warm should it be inside for the tomatoes. These decisions may affect the amount of energy by if the temperature being to hot or cold, having to big of a space, and drawing to see if its big enough or needs to be bigger.",3
154108,One important decision that will be made that will impact the temperature is the length and width of the structure. Making this decision could let more or less heat get in.,3
154109,If you get some tin or metal in the structure you can compact heat in you structure to get energy. Also you have to have a wide and short structure so all the heat stays in. Also if you use glass as your roof the sun will go in but the heat won't go out.,4
154111,One important decision I would have to make is where would I put the structure. If I put the structure in a forest I will get no heat from the sun but  if I put the structure on a plain it would get more heat from the sun.,3
154113,If you plan to move the tomatoes inside to a green house because a green house has glass panels that bring in the suns energy and heat and keeps it inside of the green house.,4
154114,They might need to build a green house so that the glass on top can be a magnifying glass and the rest of the house can protect them from the cold.,2
154115,"The important decisions I will have to make, will be to think of a structure that can keep a certain amount of  air and certain temperature in a box for a certain amount of time.",2
154117,It will effect the amount of energy that enters or leaves the structure because if you mess up the building and it is not the best temperature for the tomatoes then they would not grow fresh and they might not be in good conditions but it depends on the types of tomatoes that are growing.,3
154120,My community garden group would make a green house and we would close the doors quickly to the green house so than the cold would not get in much.  We would water the plants once a week and the green house would be warm and humid. We would set up cameras to check on the process without going in the green house.,3
154121,You need lots of green leaves and seeds and you want lot of sun so it will generwate the heat into the tomato.,3
154123,"it would affect by, how low and high the temperature is and how the tomatoes grow.",2
154125,What the strucher is made of.,2
154126,Will she be able to make it air proff so that  no air comes in and out it has to have light to be able to come in.,3
154129,My structure should be a green house because I can control the temperature with the sun's solar energy with panels that will warm up the house.,3
154131,What I would do is get solar panels and put them on top of the garden so that I could add heaters to make it the perfect temp. How this decision may affect the amount of energy is that it wouldn't use the powerlines.,2
154133,If the tempature is cold the tomatoes will not grow because there is not any sunlight if there was sun light the tomatoes will grow in the sun because it is hot.,3
154136,You will need a heater to make it hot in side the greenhouse.,2
154137,"The important decisions I would make is putting the tomatoes in a location that wouldn't melt , destroy or even squish the tomatoes. I would put the tomatoes under  a green house because a green house is like having it outside but indoors.",2
154138,you can make a green house so you can put the tomatoes. This way u can keep the tomatoes fresh and not bad.,2
154139,it can effect it by being very hat and that can kill  the plants.,2
154142,The energy that enters the structure is going to become heat and some of it is going to make the water evaporate .,4
154149,"You will need to have a tinfoil room and a glass top, so you can trap the heat and gather heat.",4
154154,it would affect the tomatoes because the sun is way to hot in the summer so you would pick them in the rain because you don't get hot sun on your back. The sun will burn your back and your neck.,3
154156,Building a energy around the garden for the tomatoes can grow.,2
154302,You can build a shed for the tomatoes instead of keeping them outside in the winter and it also depends on where in the what state  the tomatoes are growing in like if its somewhere that snows you might want to build a shed for the tomatoes instead of keep them in the snow all winter or if there are hurricanes where you live and where you are growing the tomatoes.,2
154304,a decision that might impact the temperature inside the structure would be how big the strucure is because the sun will have to heat more air in a big structure and heat less in a smaller one,4
154306,Like a magnifying glass it strengthens the heat in winter making energy for the tomatoes.,2
154308,"Some decisions I might need to make are the area,for instance the sunlight if I go and plant tomatoes at the top of mount Everest so that means location. Another is amount of water because in winter there is going to be rain so might not to water a lot. Maybe a greenhouse might work",3
154309,"The color might effect the amount of plants grown, because if it's a dark color it might trap more heat than a light color. Another variable that might effect the heat trapped inside the structure is maybe the size of the opening. When I was doing the problem with David, the size of the opening was smaller than the other box.",3
154312,you could build a garden house that has the temperature you want it to have.,2
154313,"How much sun the plants get, how much heat is given, and how much heat gets out. These are important because the plant needs sun, the plants cant be cold or they will die, and you don't want to lose heat or else that's heat that the plant isn't getting. You can make a greenhouse",3
154314,I might need to move the structure into the sun.,3
154315,"Well if you make it so there is no holes on any part of the structure you could trap the heat in and also can put a light as the sun because lights get warm after a while if the are lit and it has light just like the sun. These decision may affect the amount of energy by losing warm air, losing light, and maybe the temperature inside.",4
154316,I think you would need to make some sort of plastic structure that traps in heat from the sun to keep the tomatoes warm.,3
154317,I would make green a house with heaters but the right temperature for the tomatoes so the tomatoes would grow that  my idea.,2
154320,"important decisions I would make is do i want it to be a greenhouse? maybe the greenhouse will work really well or because it is cold act like a reverse? Should we get solar panels? they would have to be on the ground so they don't effect the sunlight coming into the green house from the top, what if it isn't sunny? the solar panels would be a waste of money and the greenhouse wont get the sun to heat it up. I would most likely go with solar panels on the ground and a greenhouse that has shades in case we needed to make artificial sunlight if it is raining or just isn't sunny",3
154328,My decision would be to build  a greenhouse because the sun mostly makes it hot in there.I think it won't affect the garden because your mostly using the sun for heat not electricity.,3
154331,You might need to make a decision you will need to make is that you might want to grow them in the fall so you can save them for winter and eat them.,2
154333,You will have to make the decisions of what materials to buy and how to put it together. These decision can change the temp drastically up to 30 degrees.,2
154334,we will have to get soler panels  so we can use heated lamps to feed it to the plants like the sun in winter so then we just need to turn the lights off then at night we give it water,3
154338,,1
154339,How the temperature is inside the place your growing the tomatoes in.If you built a structure with holes in more cold air will go inside your structure so you will need to build a structure where no cold air will go inside.,4
154340,I would build a solar panel around the tomatoes.,2
154341,I would build a solar panel around the tomatoes.,2
154344,You could build a structure/dome to cover the tomatoes to keep it humid inside for the tomatoes to grow. It will give them energy because the sun might get through the clouds and shine through the glass to give them energy.,4
154346,I think the sun is good for tomatoes because the sun have C and this pass for frut .,3
154704,"Some important decisions that will have to be made are what material should I use, what should the structure look like, or how big will it be?",3
154846,Some important decisions you will have to make are if you would make it so that light could come through it when the door isn't open or are you going to leave the door open all the time. These decisions affect the energy of the room because you are letting light in and light comes from the sun and the sun produces energy.,4
154847,"Some important decisions I would need to make would be where to put the tomatoes, how much I would water them, how many seeds I would plant, and what kind of tomatoes to grow.",3
154914,"We will need to find a way to put enough energy in to keep it alive; however, we might need to take out some energy.",3
154915,It is the good to make it were the sun hits the tomatoes.,3
153978,The color of the structure could effect the amount of heat it collects. The type of  tomatoes can effect what conditions are needed. The location of the shelter could effect how fast the tomatoes grow. the amount of plant food and water it's given could effect the health of the tomatoes.,4
153979,plant different tomatoes at different time and see with grow faster and if they fit your budget,2
153982,It will have to be inside a green house because if it to cold outside there is no possible way to grow tomatoes.,2
154914,"We will need to decide if we would make a solar oven or a miniature greenhouse or something else, and that could change the size and amount of glass/see through materials which would affect how much light/heat leaves the structure.",4
153991,"Frame: Wood
Walls: concrete
Roof: glass",3
154107,"The important decisions they need to make are how big the structure should be, where it should be built, and what way should the structure face.",3
154117,"Important things to know when building a structure for tomatoes are knowing how much sunlight  you should let into the cage, you should know how wide and tall it should so you could fit all the tomatoes in it.",3
154126,You have to make sure the temperature isn't to hot or to cold and make sure the get the best place to put the tomatoes.,2
154111,One important thing is where you are making the structure. You need to make it in a sunny place.,3
154108,"One important decision that will impact the heat in the structure is the structure's length and width. If the structure is long and wide, it will absorb more heat, but if it isn't, the tomatoes will be cold.",4
154133,I will need to make the desicions to put the tomatoes seed in sun light so when I put water they grow into tomatoes .,3
154113,You will most likely use a green house to put the tomatoes in so that the tomatoes will be able to grow through out the winter without dying.,2
154120,"The community could build a solar oven. We could plant tomatoes inside the solar oven and get a lamp to heat the plants, but it would might take more than a few weeks to see results.",3
154137,The temperature that is good enough for the tomatoes is room temperature because when I plant a flower in my house my flower is healthy and it still grows.,2
154154,you need to feed them water and sun for a while and keep them in safe places were animals don't try to eat them or damage them. that's why you need to keep them safe.,3
154114,It would depend on the height of the green house from the sun.If it was closer to the sun than it would probably get hotter because its closer to the sun.,3
154121,if the heat hits the tomato to much it can over heat and exploed.,2
154131,What an important decision that I would make is the budget  for the materials. How this would impact the decisions are that I would need more money to complete the structure.,2
154125,us medl,1
154123,i would use wood walls and glass and the sun rays would travel throw them and get trap.,4
154313,How much heat will stay in and how hot will get.,3
154315,Some decisions may be how much sun will hit the plant and how much time you have to water it.,3
154304,you will need to make sure that the heat from the sun can get inside the structure. it will impact the temperature because if the sunlight cant get inside the structure it will stay cold and wont get any hotter.,4
154704,"Some decisions will be what materials to use, where to put it, and what the roof looks like. If the structure is made out of stone, no sunlight will enter it at all. If the roof has an open top, the cold air will enter and the heat will escape. And if the structure is surrounded by trees that block out all the light, the structure won't work.",5
154303,"You would need to make sure you have all of the same kinds of tomato, leave them all in the structure in the same amount of time before picking, and make sure you build your structure under the sun because that is the heat source you are using. And it also depends on what you are using to build the structure. The decisions may affect the amount of energy that enters and leaves the structure because like I stated before, it also depends on what materials you use to build the structure because some materials absorb heat faster and more efficiently.",4
154309,"Some important variables for this green house are what colors the structure is, what material it is made out of, and it's location.",3
154316,Some important decisions would be to make sure the structure lets in enough light and heat and lets out some of the heat so they don't too hot.,3
154312,You could use a tarp so that not that much heat would hit the plants.,2
154302,Well if you build a green house then you will probably have to have a heater in the green  house with the plants that need a lot of heat.,2
154314,Some magnifying glass would help get heat from the sun.,3
154317,If to much energy enters the plant the plant would probaly die.,3
154320,"Important decisions would probably be making the inside a certain color to attract and absorb a lot of heat, making only one side of the roof glass or plexi glass so it only filters in through one side or both, possibly making the roof angled to let more sunlight in or flat which makes sunlight just go directly in unlike an angle that you can have with an angled roof..",5
154344,I would put the structure more in the sun so the structure would get hotter from the sun and heat up the tomatoes.,3
153997,It might affect it because it wont grow naturally,2
153989,Important decisions are the lights and the engry because with all of that the temputure could get too hot for the tomatoes.,3
154000,a house around it that is made of glass because practily every other farmer use's a green house,2
153987,it can make more heat to rote the tonmmatoes,2
153981,"I will need to make a decision about what material I will use to attract heat. I used black paper in my solar oven project, but I don't think that will work for a large structure. Almost everyone knows that black attracts heat, this is because the blackness absorbs all of the light coming in its direction, without letting it out. This is why they should have some kind of black surface added to the inside of the greenhouse. The greenhouse will be entirely made of glass to allow heat to get trapped, causing the green house to stay warm even in the winter. Finally, I think that the green house should have some kind of angled reflective object at the plants. This will allow more sun rays to hit the plants, making them warmer and healthier.",5
153980,I would put solar panels in to create electricity and put in heat lamps to heat the room up. Also you want to put a thermometer in to see the temperature.,2
153996,The important decisions you will have to do are make sure the area that you put the tomatoes are where there's lots of sun and no branches for shade to keep the sun away. This will affect by having to put water every day on the tomatoes.,3
154026,"You will need to choose what material to make the structure out of.  For example, if you make it out of stone, then no heat can get in.  However, if you make it out of thin glass or even a thick tarp, the heat can actually get in the structure.",3
153985,Some important decisions might be making the structure out of glass to let the perfect amount of light for the tomatoes. The glass will let in the right amount of light that will then enter the leaves.,4
153999,you need to know how big to make the structure because to much room and sun rays will escape make it to small sun rays will not be able to enter and heat the room.,3
154138,What is the temperature should be for the tomatoes. And how is the tomatoes going to stay cold.,2
154136,you need to make a green house so heat can stay in,2
154115,I will make the top of the structure glass so that the heat can get in and will stay in and can't get out.,3
154142,The important decisions of putting it in the sun so it has more heat.It is going to affect the amount of energy that enters or leaves the structure by heating up.,4
154109,One decision you will need to make to build your structure is to try to keep as much warm air as you can inside the structure. Also you will need plant lamps so you can make the grow.,3
154346,is very obivios sun are better for tomatos,3
154308,What I might do is  I will make reflector to reflect the heat back and make a closed and use black clothing and black pots. To absorb heat that is what I will do .,4
154306,"Like a magnifying glass, the heat would be stronger and the temperature would rise to an acceptable temperature.",2
154331,The decisions that you will have to make is that what kind of roof you will want to have and what temperature you will need to it to go to and how high and how low.,2
154333,Important decisions 4,1
154341,I will =,1
154334,i would put a  heat lamp and give it water every day.,2
154340,,1
154846,Some decisions that you would have to make are that you would have to decide how the sun's heat would get into the structure. You would also have to decide on how tall the structure is because a tomato plant is very tall.,3
154149,you will need a giant area for the tomatoes in a room and put a regular lamp for light and have a shower system so it acts like rain and like sunlight.,3
154156,We can use a technogy heat the energy gives the plant more to grow and give tomatoes.,2
153995,Something I'd use to impact the temperature would be a greenhouse because it will keep the cold out and bring the heat in.,2
154915,You can make a green houes to help the tomoto.,2
153983,You should have a green house that will be a whole little shelter for the plants to do their propper growing procces.,2
153994,You will need to decide,1
153988,will the tomatoes die or live in the winter? If it is sealed off how will the heat get in the box? how much money is this going to cost us in the long run? one way it will affect  the amount of energy is if you don't have the money you will have to make something to improvise while you get more money,3
153993,The sturcture will need to be tall and big so it can bring in lots of sun light for the toatoes to grow.,3
153990,One important feature would be putting it in the sun.,3
153992,the hotest will suck all of it,2
153977,"If you could use the same strategy as a solar oven, you could build a shed around the tomatoes you are growing. You could use the same solar oven tactics. You could use a reflective resource and a heat attractant cover.",3
153816,"a. The material: Materials can very greatly in the solar radiation they absorb or let through. Rubber (with holes to let sunlight in, for example, will heat up quickly and absorb it, as opposed to glass, which lets solar radiation through onto the plants.
b. Shade: This is an obvious decision, as if you have something over the structure obstructing solar rays from reaching your structure, there will be no point. Tomatoes also need sunlight to live.",5
153818,The transparency of the structure affects how freely the light travels in and out of the garden. The size and shape of the structure will also affect if light reflects of the structure.,4
153822,We will need to add solar panels to the roof witch will heaat up the building.This ffects the amouuntt of energy because solar panels have strog radiation,2
153823,You will have to find the base and height because if your structure is tall and skinny it will not collect as much energy then a structure that is short and wide because a short and wide structure has a wider range to collect more energy.,3
153824,"One of the decisions that you'll need to make is where will you put the energy producer. You need to decide that because the atmosphere of the producer has to have the right temperature, because if it does not, the energy production will be slow. You also need to think about where the energy comes in and out. You need to have the area where it comes in and out big enough so energy comes in at a steady pace, but also too much doesn't leave too fast.",3
153826,Some things that might affect it are the length and width of the structure and how thin or thick the walls of the structure are.,3
153827,you are going to have the ideal temperature in the structure that you are building it will impact the growth of the fruit.,2
153830,You have to choose the right location to build the structure so the sun doesn't get blocked by trees or the structure misses direct sunlight etc. You will also need to know what material you should use to build your structure to make sure the material isn't too thick or blocks sunlight. These could affect the amount of energy that enters or leaves the structure because the materials makes sure energy enters the structure and the location gives you the right spot to allow the energy to come in.,4
153831,I would build huge solar panels on the structure and save allot of energy for winter so we ca grow them in winter.,2
153832,the leaves absorb the energy.,2
153834,"You will need to decide what you are going to make the stucture out of. If you make it out of something that doesn't allow light in, the tomatoes may die. If you make it out of glass, the sun an go in and the plants may not die.",4
153835,ou can buid a big fenc then you put them in the warmst part of he structure to make the climate the est for the tomaos,2
153836,How many open windows may impact the tempeture because if there are a bunch of open spaces the the weather starts  be more like the tempeture. I would also need to decide if there should be glass or not. This could impact how much sun gets in the garden.,3
153837,You will need to maybe have like a greenhouse so the plants don't get frozen or animals come and eat them. Also if you want the sun to be the energy you will need some solar panels.,3
153838,"1. you will need to have sun an water
2.put it in the  place you usally use light the most
3.have good soil in the tomato plant so it ca grow",3
153839,I would need to decide where to grow the tomatoes and what would be the right temperature. It would effect it because if its to hot where I plant them they won't grow well and they would come out bad.,2
153844,It does affect the amount of energy because then the tomatoes would not be at the right temp.,3
153845,,1
153848,"I think the structure should be a greenhouse so, it can get the right amount of sunlight and the gardener can come and water the tomatoes. The greenhouse won't be as cold for the tomatoes and not to hot.",3
153852,"You will have to make sure you have the right tools to grow the tomatoes, and you will need the right type of temperature. This will affect the tomatoes by growing healthy and delicious.",2
153854,You may need solar lights and that collect all of the light from the sun and it takes up natural energy.,3
153856,"Well they can get a roof that's a solar.Why will effect the temperature?Well it will effect the temperature  because any solar in my opinion, brings energy.",3
153859,you should build a green house because it will only trapthe heat and does not let it go,3
153860,"A important decision i will need to make is the shape of the structure,this decision will affect the amount of energy that enters and leaves because the window might be smaller or wider and that might either trap the energy inside or let it go.How wide or tall it will be because,that will also impact how the energy leaves or stays.",4
153863,Maybe you can put them in a green house.,2
153864,One of the important decisions may be how to get the tomatoes a good temperature and how we should do it using solar power. These decisions can effect the tomatoes plants because we could make it too hot or not the right temperature. k,2
153905,"If he builds it out of glass, then a lot o sun energy will enter the structure for the plants to grow. If he built it out of concrete sun energy would not enter making the plants die. How many doors? What is the ground made of?",4
153906,It could snow or a big gust of wind may be able to ruin or blow away the structure,2
153908,"I would need to do research in order to find some elements that could help me heat this garden up, with help of the sun. This could effect the amount of energy that enters or leaves the structure with help this could happen.",3
153909,You need to build a sunhouse because the sun will come in but the cold will not.,3
153910,How tall does it need to be. If its too short the the tomatoes will get smushed.,2
153911,maybe make a green house and then us the sun's rays to shine on the tomatoes,3
153913,"it might impact it because it might die with out water and sun because if it's o cold,hot it's going to die.",3
153914,"You will need to study the way the sun moves, so the structure will get the most sunlight has possible. These decisions might affect the amount of energy that enters and leaves the structure because the sun is their energy.",4
153916,All of the tomato plants will need to be in the same location. This will affect the amount of energy because there are different areas where there is more sunlght and less sunlight.,3
153917,i will need good decisions and possibly a debate,2
153918,"how much sunlight is getting in , and get solar panlas for energy",3
153919,It will need to be a greenhouse so that the sun rays can get through but the cold of winter can't get o the plants.First you will need to make sure that none of the cold outside air gets in but air can still flow to get to the plants.Second to be able for the warm air to get in could filter the air and use the sun to warm the air or use sun power to make the air warmer.,3
153921,You will need to think about how big the structure will me. It will effect it because if it is big and wide there will be more heat leaving. But is it is small the heat will get trapped and make the tomatoes warmer.,3
153922,i will need to be careful with my decisions because if i do something that i chose to do and i do it wrong it might affect my whole project,2
153923,You need to find the area because than you can fit all the tomatoes in and each can get all the sun they need to grow.,3
153924,well need water  sun light and air,3
153925,I would make an oven that is use in the sun with no electricity to work,3
153926,you might want to make a pretty warm house and plant the tomatoes there and the you have glass on the roof so the light can come in and give the tomatoes light for them to grow.,4
153927,they can bulid a garden house because and you can use a a  candel so you keep them growing,2
153928,Important decisions you have to make would be maybe the way yo build the structure. It would also depend on the amount of holes or window you put.,3
153929,I will need to decide how big the building will be.,3
153930,It effects it because they add extra weight to the structure. I dont understand.,2
153931,that it doesnt have a lot of heat.,2
153932,my gratst odject is woter becuse you need to water it ever month,2
153933,"You can use solar panels to create the perfect environment for the tamatoes, I dont really know how solar panels work but I do know that they create light and temperature .",2
153935,"You would maybe want to make a pretty warm garden, house, or environment so you can pant the tomatoes there so they can grow ad not die.",2
153936,how meny,2
154112,Some important decisions are to maybe build like a box that is short and wide for the tempature to go up so the tomatos would grow a little faster.,2
154118,the decisions are important because there might be to much heat or to little heat that cuold kill the plant.,2
154119,You need to make sure that there is all of the sun pointing in the direction of the inside of the structure. This will make it warmer in the building so you can You also want to make sure you are not near a bay or a body of water because it is usually cooler there.,3
154122,the main thing is the time of the day cause of the weather,2
154124,The structure that surrounds the tomatoes should be made out of glass or clear plastic so lots of light and energy can come through the structure.,4
154127,Some decisions are how big you are going to build the structure and what materials you are going to use to build the structure. These decisions can impact the amount of energy because some materials let energy through easily while others do not.,4
154128,Have the roof be made of glass so the ray from the sun can get through and be more powerful.,4
154130,they make a lot of decisions because to see how it will work.,2
154132,you need to figure out what materials your structure will be made out of because of how they contract heat. you will need to know how big the structure is because of how much heat can stay in a certain size.,4
154134,You need to decide where you're going to put the structure because the location will impact the temperature where your structure is. Another thing that will impact the temperature is how big you want the structure to be. If you have a large structure it won't be as warm inside as it would be in a smaller structure because more sunlight will be able to hit the it rather than a large structure.,3
154135,You would need something that could gather the energy and then send it to the tomatoes to grow so i would use solar pannels and then use solar ovens to give to the tomatoes to grow and  i would rig the sprinkler system so i could water them more efitiontly,3
154141,"You need a space that will be able to get sunlight,nowhere that is dark,need to water it.",3
154143,I need sun and rain because sun keeps it alive but to much makes it dry. But rain makes it the root grow and produce soil.,3
154145,I good decision would be to  plant them during the spring because the sun will hit it and so will the rain. If you did Summer it will burn the plant.  the sun will reflect to the sun and the rain will wet the plant so that it can grow.,3
154146,"You will need it to be cold and warm not hot because than they will rotten quickly, well it also depends if you leave it out in the sun. If you leave it in your house and it is really hot then nothing will happen to it.",2
154147,You would have to plant the tomatoes in a sunny spot and then build the structure big enough so that is gets sun and reflects the sun to the tomatoes.,3
154148,If the structure is made of metal the heat will go in faster. If the building is made of wood then heat will come naturally.,2
154150,if you have the correct temp and the water you wold be fine because you can see if your plant grows,2
154152,To make the tomatos we will need the seeds water and sun and ifits the winter then in the night you put the light and in the morning you turn it off and put water only once or twice a week,3
154153,You need to use the right soil because if you use the wrong one the plant mite not grow how its supposed to.,2
154157,"You would raise  the money higher because it takes longer to make the tomato, the temperature is too cold.",2
154160,If it's colder it takes longer to grow the tomatoes.So they should raise up the money.,2
154161,The important decisions you need to make is that if you want to plant the tomatoes in the winter but the tomatoes won't grow so the winter will affect the tomatoes.,2
154162,how cold it gets and how hot it gets and you need to make sure to see how the plants get.,2
154163,they need sun and water so they will grow.,3
154193,If I block most of the sun the plant does not get the the right amount of sun.,3
154194,As you build the structure you would want to put it in the sun and make sure it is not to skinny and not to wide. If it is to wide the energy escapes and if its to skinny it wont heat up that much. These are my decisions on how to build this structure.,3
154195,A important decision to make would be to make sure your structure isn't too hot or cold.,2
154196,To not put a lot of water because  to much water will make the plants cold,2
154197,"How thick the walls are, how much sunlight will get in. The thickness of the walls because if the walls are very thick, heat will be trapped inside and how much sunlight because the sunlight will effect the heat.",5
154198,"Make the tempature inside around 75 degrees inside because if its too cold, the plants will not grow. If its too hot, the plants would not get any dew for the plants to grow.",2
154199,You will need a closed place so the temperature will stay the same and it should stay in front or beneath the sun.The sun should warm up the tomato house.,3
154200,i would probably make a green house and on the roof to have solar panels to provide sunlight and energy for lights to heat up the tomatoes.,3
154201,If I added too much water it will effect the growth of the tomato and damage.,2
154202,Some decisions you will make are: What objects absorb heat? What radiates kinetic energy? Where can you find some websites about solar ovens?,3
154204,keep them in a warm place,2
154205,"Covering the tomatoes with a wall which the tomatoes can have less sunshine. Plus, you can decide if you which constant variables.",3
154206,You would need to know how much sunlight the tomatoes get in the structure because if the tomatoes get to little sunlight they'll die.,3
154207,The decisions may effect the amount of the energy because you may not wont to build a structure for the tomatoes to no die of the coldness,2
154208,You would need a medium sized opening so enough solar energy could come in that the heat would be enough to grow tomatoes.,4
154210,I would make the tempetature by making solar panels that connect to humidifiers to heat the greenhouse up. The solar panels will make us not pay for electricity.,2
154211,I would install solar panels and that energy would be used for strong light to eat up the green house,2
154212,these decisions would make a impact because the all these decisions add up to what the temputure is and the temputure is what will either kill or make the plant survive.,2
154214,"I would make a green house to provide the right amount of sunlight, nutrients, water, and carbon dioxide it will need.",3
154215,i would use glass and a lot of things that are nessecary,3
154216,I would put it in the sun until it grows.,3
154217,solar planer and let it stay there for a day or two and look it and and you have to water it so it can grow,2
154218,you will need to plant the seeds and take good care of your tomatoes and water them every day.,2
154220,i dont know,1
154221,you would need to know how much sunlight the tomatoes get and were the sunlight comes from.,3
154223,you will need  to get some sun light maby air conditioner,3
154224,A inside garden.,2
154226,The structure should have sun energy.,3
154228,when its warm because it gives it more time to grow.,2
154307,You would want to build the structure in the spring because the weather is most likely to be nice to grow. The structure should strong so that most animals not get in.,2
154318,the people at are growing the tomatoes and they have to water it every singe day and grow the tomato tree,2
154319,To build this structure an important decision to make is how open this structure is as in door or openings. Explaining why this is important it's important because if there is a opening the energy will just leave the structure before it heats up the tomatoes.,3
154321,You will need to have a healthy enviorment around you and you should not have any snow.,2
154322,it depends on how many solar panes there are and you need to know how many plants you are growing.,2
154323,how im going to get heat,2
154324,I would make a Black enclosure because black attracts heat and have the inside white so the heat that goes into the enclosure gets reflected back to the plants.,3
154325,"Using sun is the key in this structure, helping the sun stay inside the structure will also help keep the tomatoes warm, so an important desicion is the way you choose to design it.",3
154326,I think that a green house would be a good way to make a place worm. The sun can go through a peace of glass and make the place warm.,3
154327,It should be a low glass structure with water in it will create wae,3
154329,You will need to have the right place to plant the tomatoes the right tempreture.,2
154330,"you need to make it a closed structure so that the cold does not get in, and the tomatoes can grow.",3
154335,you will need to know what the temp is in the tomato room befor you try to grow your tomatoes. You will need to keep the temp in the room,2
154336,u would need some sunny days some rainy day,3
154337,Since you are in cold weather than you can't get the energy from the sun to make electricity. To make it easier to finish the project if you are in a location that has sun for electricity that you need for the project.,3
154342,An important decision to make is if you want to see into the inside from the outside or just have it completely insalated.Anoher important decision to made  is if you woud like the height to be tall and skinny or large and short.,2
154343,if you put too little wood the tomato wont grow and it will freeze,2
154345,You need a place that gets energy from the sun that is not that far. Also you not make to many solar ovens or the tomato will die.,3
154353,use a green house,2
154371,make it have lots of windows and make it have heat thing,3
154514,You will need a good environment like a sunny place but not to sunny and you will need something see though something that lets radiation through,4
154703,when the sun is out I can cover the top of the structure so it would be less hot for the tomatoes.,3
154155,they could use a green house with heat lamps to make the perfect temperature to grow tomatos.,2
154151,no,1
153824,"One decision I might want to make to help the temperature is maybe put some black paper or something reflective that will increase temperature. Then when the heat is too much, you can take those things away to lower temperature.",3
153822,Solar panels may impact the temp because they use energy and heat from the sun to make heat n the green house. The would affect it because it would warm up the inside of the green house to have a good temp for the tomatoes. Also the house should be glass so its exposed to the sun.,4
153844,Solar panels can rise or impact the heat there is to grow the tomatoes and the structures roof can also be made of glass to trap the heat and so it is exposed to the sun.,4
153852,"The important decisions are getting tomato seeds, the right amount of soil, and water.",2
153838,you'll need to build a strucuture around the plant an then as you finsh building it for sun light you can poke  hole's around it so it gets sunlight.,3
155053,The tomatoes should be grown in a greenhouse made out of glass to  contain the heat and energy.,4
153831,Cover with glass and make it under the sun so the radiation can stay in the glass. Then make flaps that reflect the heat so no heat will escape. Last put black paper so it absorbs the heat.,5
153816,Glass walls; let sun in while still trapping air,4
153823,You will have to find the base and height because if your structure is tall and skinny it will not collect as much energy then a structure that is short and wide because a short and wide structure has a wider range to collect more energy.,4
153837,You need to know if any animals come around because they could eat all the tomatoes you also need to know what the weather is like. Knowing this information will help you make the tomatoes grow healthy.,2
153864,these things will effect it because what if wen its built it and its too hot in the structure that the plants die immediately,2
153923,"You will need the right stuff to build it, and the tomatoes nee their own space to grow.",2
153928,You might want to make too much windows that could give unwanted cold air. You also might want to make sure you do not build the structure where there are trees because how will the sun get to the house and heat up the temperature.,3
153909,"The structure will have to be made of a clear material such as glass because, the glass will create what is called a greenhouse effect which will keep in the sun rays inside the structure to grow the tomatoes.",4
153913,"A green house,and a spot were the heat is going to hit.",2
153917,they will not work because it will burn the plants.,2
153916,You need to find a certain area with enough sunlight to help the tomatoes grow. There needs to be an equal amount of sunlight and shade in the structure.,3
153935,You will have to have the tomatooes in a good envirement an have a tempature o arund 70* degrees and wi nee to water them.These decisios will affect  the amount of energy because the enviremental features the place has.,3
153922,I would use glass to trap the heat inside the small garden house.,3
153921,You want to know if you want it to have a glass or other material cover at the top. If you do then more energy can come in and less energy can come out.,4
153934,"senvando.  agua, Energia    del sol",2
153911,make sure they get the ammount of sun light they need with maybe a lamp or like greenhouse and don't give them to much sun and don't give them to much less sunlight,3
153930,I would need to know if a tent would affect the temperature or a cover or anything really.,3
154112,Where to put it because if you put it under a hood it will get cooler so you need to put it directly under the sun.,3
153926,Grow the plant in a greenhouse and make the walls thick so no coldness can get in and then there will be glass at the top so sunlight can get in.,4
153908,"I would need to do research in order to find some elements that could help me heat this garden up, with help of the sun. This could effect the amount of energy that enters or leaves the structure with help this could happen.",3
153905,"If he builds it out of glass, then a lot of sun energy will enter the structure for the plants to grow. If he built it out of concrete sun energy would not enter making the plants die. How many doors? What is the ground made of? How large is it?",4
153918,how you will build the garden and how will you get,2
153906,Make a wooden frame around the tomatoes then put some plastic rap on the sides and top  so the suns rays (Light/Heat) will stay in.,4
153919,You will need to build a greenhouse around the tomatoes so the cold air will not get to the tomato plants.,2
153914,You will need to know the angels that the sun will be at and that the structure you build will be able get sun throughout the whole day. You will need to decide what shape you want the structure to be (short and wide/ skinny and tall/ circle). You will need to know if you will use reflection.,3
153927,they could bulid a greenhouse so the heat stayes in,2
154135,you may need solar panels so they can direct the heat back at the tomatoes and you can use the sprinkler system as a watering tool so you won't have to go to each plant everyday and water it,2
154124,When building I will need to think abut what matirial to use because it will affect how much heat is going through the matirial of he structure.,4
154132,You will need to decide what material to use like glass lets sun in if you used brick the tomatoes would not get any sunlight and die. You will need to decide how big the community garden is so if you have a smaller one theres less room to grow and might get hotter.,4
154162,you would need to build something that would help the tomatoes grow.,2
154134,Important decisions you need to make are how big and tall is the structure going to be and where is the location going to be.  These decisions may affect the amount of energy that enters and leaves the structure because the size of the structure affects how much sunlight comes inside and how much  radiation there will be. Also it will affect there being conduction and convection.,4
154153,How the sunlight hits and how it will work on the plants.,3
154118,you will need to know how much hot or cold air comes into the structure. this is important because if too much hot or cold air comes in it might kill the plants.,2
154155,"you  will need to take i count in what spot you want to put your structure. If you put it out in a plain , its going to get more sunlight, than if you put in a gruop of trees  , wich is going to get more shade.",3
154119,You will need to have a see-though roof because the sun will need to go through the roof. If it was a solid color the sun would be blocked and the tomatoes would die. Also you will need to have the inside to have dark colors like black. It will make the heat warmer for the plants to maximize the energy and heat for them to grow.,4
154163,Went you do a garden you will have a loss us fust.,2
154130,i would get materials to built a fence and the plant some tomatos,2
154150,"you could build a green house because it gives it shade, sunlight and people can even go inside to the green house",3
154122,It depends where you live and if the its cloudy most of the time,2
154127,"I need to decide what materials to use on top to let the sun rays into the structure, how large the structure will be, and how to keep the structure from overheating and killing the tomato plants. These might affect the amount of energy because if I choose the wrong materials there will be too much solar energy in the enclosure and if the structure is too large, there won't be enough heat for the plants.",5
154143,"i think we might need sunlight,shelter to protect,and lastly i think we need is moisture/soil.",3
154128,The structure should be closed so no heat can get out and the cover should be clear so the sun's radiation gets in easily.,5
154141,You need clear glass around the tomatoes so the sun can get to the tomatoes  and not have the heat escape.,4
154145,One important decision you to make is what time of winter you want to grow the tomatoes. This i important because sometimes in winter they won't grow it would just freeze.,2
154208,You need to know what cover you are using ad if it will let in enough heat. You need to know if the material of the structure absorbs heat.,3
154202,"You need to figure out how you can trap the heat and let more heat in at the same time. This may affect the amount of energy because if you put more effort into trapping heat, less might be able to come in.",3
154193,The strucurte has to let heat in so the plants get heat but it can not let in cold air or it can not let hot air or heat leave.,3
154200,You need to have some open spaces to let air out and something to reflect the sun inside of your structure these decisions will affect your tempature by makin it heat more or not aas much,3
154206,what you use to build the green house because if you use material than maks the green house colder than that old be a bad idea.,2
154224,I would give he tomato's everything they need.,2
154212,Well just like the solar ovens because you are trying to keep the most air and heat in the structure. You are also trying to find the best way to get the air in and out.i think the having solar pannles will help the are get in and out fast.,2
154214,we would need to make green house to have the suns radiation rays hit the plants for energy. the energy would stay because the plants are soaking up all the sunlight.,3
154216,You need to know thw right amount of sulight.,3
154218,well if you add tin foil it will attract the sun and solar radiation and if you add plastic wrap then it will trap and bring the heat in the box.,4
154221,I would build a small structure for the tomatoes and I would have to windows that are on he ruff for the sun to enter.,3
154226,the stucture must have sun energy must water them.,3
154217,make some kind of house like and getting a beam of light that it is going to grow them more faster than the sun and you will,3
154220,I would plant my tomatoes,2
154199,The first decision I will make is to build a green house.The green house will be closed unless someone will have to come in.The green house will be in a tent shape and be green.It wont be thick so the heat can go through.This will affect the energy because the outside material will be different so the heat can come in and the inside fabric will be different to let the heat in.,3
154198,We need to make sure the glass will be not too thick so light wont get in,4
154215,I will need to see what type of stuff im gonna use to not impact the temperature like i would be able to use some kind of paper.These decisions may affect the amount of energy that enters or leaves the structure by not taking good care of the plants and water them.,2
154196,Some important decisions you would need make are to make sure the heat will get in easily but not get out easily.So you will need the perfect materials because if you don't choose the right materials your tomatoes wont get enough heat.,3
154201,It will be affected because the tomatos will be affected by heat without water.,2
154205,If you want to put a cover to put over the tomatoes the tomatoes will get less sunlight. If you have a black covering the tomatoes the black fabric will absorb the heat,4
154197,"How thick the walls are, if there will be enough room for sunlight to get in, and what the temperature is in the structure. How thick the walls are because heat will need to get through, enough room for the sunlight because sunlight provides heat and not enough room will make the inside cold, and what the temperature is because the starting   temperature before the structure is built can affect it after it is built.",4
154204,If I build a house with solar lights the tomatoes might grow faster.If i did not do any thing at all then my tomatoes might grow slower then with the light.I will close the windows so the heat will not get out.,4
154195,"We will need to make sure that the structure is completely closed, because we do not want heat to escape. We will need a lot of room for heat to enter, because of how big the building will be. I think a lot of windows should be on the walls so that radiation can take place. We may want to include reflective surfaces so heat can be reflected onto tomatoes.",5
154311,The coled because leas are weak in cold places and its had tg in places like that,2
154322,You may want to use plexi glass or regular glass so it is stir-die and that can make it warmer.,3
154310,It may affect by the plant can get  to much sun.you can make a hole so the sun can go in.The convection can go through the glass.,3
154327,"WE should make the building low so when the warm air rises and cools, it doesn't go to high so the average temperature stays  warmer.",4
154342,Some important ideas you need to think about are the thickness of the glass and if you want the walls to be glass or insulated.Another thng thy need to consider is it being tall and skinny or short and wide,3
154326,we will need to use radiation and keep the heat in. If the eat does not stay in than the greenhouse will not heat up.,4
154324,"We should seal it with plexiglas, make the outside black to attract heat, and have the inside a reflective material so the radiation will reflect around.",4
154319,"You need to make the decision of whether or not your structure will be open to the outside cold or closed with a door  because the heat will escape and if the roof will be glass, plastic, etc. or a non see through material so the sun rays are being radiated into the greenhouse or structure. Also if the inside of your structure will be a light color like whit e or a dark color like black so that the inside will absorb more heat which will most likely heat it up a ton.",6
154343,one very big factor in building a green house for your tomatos is wood that is black. dark colors observe heat and make the thing that has black hotter. if a thing has white on it will likely get colder or stay the same tempeture,4
154307,It is of course good to have sunlight. I would he roof out of glass so the light can hit the plant. I would also make sure that the structure is stable so no preadators will come in and that if there is any bad weather then the structure won't fall over.,4
154371,you would need metal next to the plants because it would attract heat and get hot. windows to let in the light and walls around it.,4
154353,you would built a  greenhouse,2
154336,I think the tomatose will need more sun than water.,3
154325,"We will need to see what structure will be used to make the place for the tomatoes like when we were doing the solar oven experiment it will depend on what structure will work, a wide and short box will be pretty ideal so it can absorb the heat better than the tall and short one can.",3
154329,You will need to do this during the day because most of the sun comes out when you would plant it this will affect by having sunlight to grow these tomatoes.,3
154323,were im going to bild my structure,2
154345,You will need to make sure that the structures don't have a lot of air coming out. And to get more heat to go in you will need to make sure that the air is the right temperature for the tomatos.,3
154703,solar panals next to where the tomatoes for more heat also not to much or it will be to hot for the tomatoes to grow.,2
155334,time the day when its time to pick the tomatoes and what temp. its suppoust to be,2
153836,"Windows may affect how much hot air stays in the building to heat the building, if there is a lot of open windows then the heat will not stay in the building.  The material I use would also affect how much heat got in the building and stayed in the building, glass may work better than metal. The flooring would also affect the amount of heat in the building, metal flooring may not work as well as black flooring.",4
153834,You will need to decide what material to use because some materials may not let sun through and that is needed for plants to grow.,4
153863,I would use a green house because it attracts the sun. Also it doesn't use electricity since you are not allowed to use electricity.,3
153843,it will effect the energy because it is in a inclosed area but it is also in a green house where it is see throw so it still gets sun light,3
153826,You will need to know how wide the cover will be. you also need to know the amount of sunlight that can pass through you cover.,3
153856,It will impact the temperature and the tomatoes because if its to cold then it won't help the tomatoes grow so you need a solar light to keep the structure warm so the tomatoes can grow at night.,2
153848,"I would think about what attracts heat and how it will impact on the tomatoes.
I would also think about what type of environment I need to put the tomatoes in, for them to grow.
I would also think about how much water and sunlight tomatoes need.",3
153835,Some important desicions you have to make is whether to  build the structure where the most sun will hit because then the greenhouse effect might work.,3
153860,Decisions that need to be made are where the structure will be this will impact it because if it is under the sun they will not be cold and will grow. Another decision would be how big the space is. This will impact it because if it is big it will fit more tomatoes but if it is smaller it won't fit as many.,3
153827,you are going to have the ideal temperature in the structure that you are building it will impact the growth of the fruit.,2
153830,"I will need to pick the right location which has the right temperature so the right amount of heat energy can enter the structure. I will also need to pick the right material to use so sunlight can pass through and help the plants grow. Lastly, I will need to pick the right tomato plant that will grow in the conditions my structure is in.",4
154514,A giant Aluminum flap and it will affect the energy and leave by having the suns rays hit and reflecting it onto the tomatoes giving it more energy and light,4
153859,You should build a green a house because it trap all the heat and does not releas it.,3
153832,` You would have molding and rot if the temperature was not right so you need to build aa structure tht will tkeep them fresh.,2
153854,I will put the tomatoes in a closed area and put tinfoil on the sides and black paper on the top as well as plexiglass on the bottom. This will keep the tomatos warm to be able to grow during the winter. Since the tomatoes will be in a closed box this will make sure only heat comes in and not out.,3
153839,I would need to know how many tomatoes I will be growing and how much space I need.I would need to pick the season to grow them. These decisions will affect the tomatoes because I don't want to be growing the tomatoes in the snow.,2
153818,"Important decisions must be made while designing the structure. These include the wall material, roof material, position on the planet, etc.
If the walls are transparent, more energy can go in but might fly though and go out the other side. With one side open, you can make sure that that side is where the sun usually rises based on your position on Earth.
If the roof is transparent, energy will come in through the roof and hit a wall or the ground.
If the position is on the equator, more energy might come from the sun because the radiation has less atmosphere to plow through.",4
153915,maybe if the ave tin foil use tin foil.,3
153925,in the summer they it will not be a impact,2
153924,I would need something  to cover the top,3
153936,leaves the structure,2
154148,If we make the structure out of glass and wood it could heat it up because magnifying glass are made of glass and it heats things up and make things look bigger.,3
154152,You will need sun and water.,3
154160,Since winter is cold and sometimes it rains the tomatoes can get rain out of the rain and for the sun you can just use a light for the sun.,3
154157,They should raise up the money because its takes longer to make the tomatoes in the winter.,2
154147,In order to get the energy to the stem of tomato you must keep track of the weather and see were in the garden is the right spot to plant tomato's and also check the soil.,2
154159,you may need to grow the tomatoes in a green house.,2
154161,It can effect the leaves or structure because maybe the plant won't get sunlight or water like being grown in the coldness.,3
154146,You first need to come up with your plan and then find out what is a good temperature before you start to plant your tomatos because if you plant the tomatoes and you dont know he right temperature han you might have some rotten tomatoes.,2
154211,You could make a green box around them so the heat would get in but wouldn't leave.,3
154210,One of the important decision is where the plants will go and how much heat will hit the plants. The I will need to decide how much heat will leave at a time and that will effect how hot the tempeture is.,2
154321,"You need a good location that won't get to much snow if it does snow, and is snow gets to the tomatoes then they will probably freeze and the community won't get tomatoes.",2
154318,"water,and sun because it will help it grow faster",3
149950,You may have to build a little house for the tomatoes so the temperature doesn't freeze them.,2
149966,"Where you plant the tomatoes, or where you put the structure, because you need enough sun to make them grow, and in the winter, you need to find just the right place. So, you need to put it in the place where there is plenty of sunlight, depending on where you live.",4
149972,"You would want a structure that lets a lot of heat in, but doesn't let a lot leave, like a greenhouse.  However, you may want it to release some in the summer to prevent over heating.",3
149587,You would need to make sure the garden it in a spot where the sun can shine on them. Another decision you would need to make is what you are building the structure out of. You will also need to decide what soil you use.,3
149959,i would build the thing at grocery stores that heats up the plant and keeps it moist. they will have an affect on the plants because they will be feed once a day,2
149953,You might want to build a shed with a window on top so the sun's energy gets in and feeds the plants and keep it moist in there.,4
149970,Based on the last question i will use a greenhouse that is wide and short to soak up the sun.,3
149963,"As you plan to build the structure, you will need to decide what thing you will need to impact the temp, and you will need to know what kind of tomato plant is right for what degree of temp.",2
149590,it will use alot of enery because it is building a hole new structure,2
149956,You could put a box around the tomatoes to not get a lot of cold in there.  when you put a clear box around it gets the right amount of sun as well.,3
149964,You would need to get a lot of heat gathered into the building so you have heat for the tomatoes.,2
149961,you need it to be warm,2
149588,"Maybe you could put a hole on top when it's hot outside and the sun is shining, but then if it's cold, the tomatoes will rot.",3
149955,You would have to be careful for the heat  because it might die.,2
149967,the tomatos can produce energy from the sun,2
150648,You will need to decide what you will want the structure to be made of.,2
149965,It will affect the energy because the tomatoes won't get enough sun light.,3
149954,i would create a barrier around them so it doesn't get cold,2
149962,use area where there is sun so they can grow,3
149947,"I will need to build solar pannels to absorb heat into the structure witch will need to have a warm, inside area because the plants have to have a warm invorment  to live.",3
149958,These decisions may affect the structure because if the hole is to small there won't be enough heat but if the,2
149969,I will need to make the structure so that not a lot of heat leaves it but a lot comes in.,3
149951,to grow plants they need sunlight,3
149971,you can build solar panels,2
150065,"You would need a building that could use the greenhouse effect so that all the heat that comes inside, stays inside.",2
150066,I think you might have to build a wood structure around the tomato because then it might keep the hot air with the tomato for it to grow. Some air might leave but if you build it good enough i think that the tomatoes will grow.,3
150074,You will need a light source that you can keep running without electricity. This decision may affect the amount of energy in a variety of ways.,3
150076,The important decisions I will need to make that might impact the temperature is to find a solution to solve the problem. What I would do is place a fabric over it to protect it from the wind.,2
150073,You have to make just right it can't be to hot or to cold,2
150078,You need to put the building where there is a lot of sun. You need to do this because it absorbs more energy.,4
150070,The structure has to be high to grow the tomatoes and there will be 1 glass window to let the light in where the sun comes in the most and the inside is room temperature this will impact the amount of energy because at the top there is more cold and if the sun moves from its usual spot,4
150072,"Well I would do some hot water and some food to keep them growing and also a flashlight, I chose these items because 1, Warm water is part of convection and will keep the tomatoes warm. 2, The flashlight will help them grow a little bit and part of radiation. 3, I chose food because it gives the tomato plant energy and part of conduction.",2
150075,"I need to know what materials can hold heat the longest so the tomatoes have heat, when it is cold or hot so that we can give the tomatoes the right things, and I need to know which tomatoes grow the best in hot or cold temperatures.",3
150077,"You need to know how long the sun is up and how many hours it takes each day for a tomato to grow. These decisions may affect the amount of energy that enters or leaves the structure because you need to pin-point the sun into the structure, but the sun moves overtime until night. It also depends on how many hours it takes to grow one.",3
150069,You would probably need to make the tomato a place that is compact so that the temp stays the same all the time,2
151162,You have to have the right amount of water and sunlight everyday.,3
150052,I'm not sure but i think that it affects the energy because it stays trapped in there.,2
150067,you will have to have enough sun to live so you can't hide them from the sun and you can't let too much cold air into where the tomatoes are,3
150063,"You need to decide how many tomatoes you will be growing, what kind of tomatoes you will grow, what the garden is made of, and how large the garden is.",2
150056,They can make a green house for the tomato's because the green house would keep them at a right temperature. Also it doesn't  need anergy it just needs sunlight. When the humans enter the green house and leaves they might take some energy out but the temperature would still be good for the tomato's to grow.,3
150061,I will need to make solar panles that will power the warm lamps the make the tomatoes grow. Some of the heat will leave the stucher but most will stay in.,2
150059,first i would need something that would work as a tent also that it's thick enough so that the tomatoes receive no cold but thin enough so that the sun can hit the tomatoes.,3
150062,One important decision i will need to make the impact of the temperature is that i would need to make sure that the tomatoes are in the sun.,3
150064,well if i put a lot of tomatoes then the temp will be higher if i put less it would be lower.,2
150079,What decisions you will need to make are be careful for how much money your going to have to use to buy the solar panels and make the structure  strong  to hold them.,2
150053,you need special glass called green house glass . what it dose is it keeps the suns heat in  the greenhouse but at the same time lets it out so it doesn't get to hot,2
150054,The decisions I would need to make are to put in in the right spot so each tomato has enough heat and I would make something that would make a greenhouse effect so the tomatoes can be warm.,3
150055,The important decisions that i will need are water a temperature time .,2
150058,use a suler patl,1
150060,You should put it in a spot with sun. This will heat it up.,3
150071,"I will need to make sure that it is in a good spot, like by a tree so that it would block the snow during the winter",2
150057,You will need to build the structure where the sun comes through. Also you need lots of water and a good supply of dirt.,3
150085,You will need to make the decision on whether to make to structure that can gain a lot of energy but also loose a lot of energy or to make a structure that gains little energy but also looses little. The first structure would be short and wide while the second structure would be tall and skinny.,3
150098,"As you plan to build the structure for the tomatoes some important decisions you will need to make are: what materials are you going to use, when and where are you going to start and do this, what do you need to do to impact the temperature.",3
150087,Something important that I would need to know is how much sun comes in and when does it come in.The reason why I would need to know this is because I need to know when the tomatoes will get the amount of sun they need.Another thing I would need to know is how much sun they need I need to know this so I don't kill the tomatoes before they are ready.,3
150104,i think that if you cover the tomatoes with something like a blanket it will capture the heat of the sun,3
150101,"You would need radiation (sun), water for watering the tomatoes (conduction), and convection inside the tomato.",2
150099,I think you will need a cover/roof that will reflect or something so it will make it warmer inside. You will need a door the keep the heat in too.,3
150105,I would get solar panels connected to warming lights so the tomatoes will grow in the correct temperature.,2
150109,"If you build it high, it may provide too much sunlight which mak cause the tomato to rot, however if you build it too low it may  not have enough sunlight",3
150093,"In this project I will need the following things to build the structure for tomatoes is wood, thermometer, seeds of tomatoes to grow, pots to put the dirt, some shelves to put your gardening tools (gloves, hat, ect), nail, hammer, and some optional things",2
150086,whenever there is sunlight you need to get as much sun as possible,3
150097,"You might have to find a spot in the shade, or you might have to build a indoor garden that is made out of windows so that way the tomatoes are in the sunlight.",3
150083,,1
150114,it will mack the tmato bad,2
150094,to put the the object in the right spot to get the right omount of sun light,3
150084,My important decisions that I will need to make that might impact the temperature is that I,2
150082,"You could put the structure in the main direction of the sun, so that you could get more sun on your plants.",3
150103,"I think I may have to build a structure similar to a greenhouse, but strong enough to hold all the warm air from the sun inside. I would also need to limit the openings so that the warm air in the greenhouse does not escape.",4
150090,It can not be in the cold and you cant have electricity around it or else it will not grow all of the light has to be from the sun,3
150092,no because it would be sollar energy not electicity so it wont use our energy it will use the suns energy.,3
150113,the tomatoes they starts by seeds to sprats then they go on and on untile the tomatoes are ramp to be pick .,2
150080,you would need a green hose becuse it will ceep it warm.,2
150111,i would put it straght leavs,2
150112,You may need a glass structure so it acts like a open garden.,2
150096,the tomatoes will have to have sun in to the tomatoes and make the room tempert to be 76 room tempertes.,3
150106,the tomatoes are is proviting energy from the sun and and olso the garden and when they put the soil and the oil can make the tomatoes grow  and  grow biger,3
150132,"I would need the have the plants in a greenhouse.  They would have to be directly in front of the sun, no trees or rocks could be blocking the build, since the plants need sunlight 24/7 or else they will die.",3
150133,I will chose to make a greenhouse so the sun will provide energy to the tomatoes instead of using electricity.,3
150130,Make it out of glass so the sun can go in and put plastic to stop it from going out.,4
150127,I think I should make a low but wide structure because it will heat up quicker. I should also make the walls and ceiling out of something clear so the sun light can come in and heat up the building since the garden doesn't have electricity access.,4
150117,"I would try to make a structure that will hold heat. I would bring it in the house and then i would maybe go in the room that is hot . I would also open the window so it can have some air. I would open the window once in awhile so it doesnt get too cold. I would keep the temperature up. if there was a shelf in the bathroom, I would also put it in there because when i take a shower, the steam would be hot and then the tomatoes will grow it will get some water too if it is steamy in the bathroom.",3
150115,What I,1
150124,You need to make sure it wont be to cold to grow them.,2
150131,"You will need a transparent window to let more sun in. You will also need a big space for the tomatoes to have enough room to grow as it would if it were to be growing outside. A wide and clear window will allow more light to pass through. A wide and big container to under the sun, not in shade will let the most sun shine through especially.",4
150134,I might put it in a different enviroment.,2
150145,WIth the tomatoes your going to need the right temperature.also the most sunlight you can possibly you can get for the plant.,3
150137,I think that  I should use solar  because it does not take electricity  it produces natural electricity. and it will provide,2
150149,"You will need to know how many square yards you are using or how much space you are taking up. Also, you will need to have the tomatoes in just the right amount of sunlight so they get as much sun as needed.",3
150140,I need to make sure that the temperature outside might be a good day to grow tomatoes so I could harvest them.,2
150122,"I would need to find the right dimensions because you don't want it to be to cold. I would also need to find a place to put it where there is the most sun all day long, and i would also need to make the walls not to dense so heat can get trapped in it and not be able to escape. I would basically need to build a green house.",3
150123,"You will have to decide where to put it, if you grow the tomatoes outside it might be to cold so you need to decide where to place the tomatoes were it has just the right temperature.",2
150138,The sun gives radition to the sorl panles.,3
150118,,1
150136,I'd have to monitor it perpetually and care for it with water to prevent dehydration or lack of health.,2
150142,the temperature would have to be pretty cool for the tomatoes,2
150125,"Important decisions you will make can affect the tomatoes, so you will need to know the right materials and know how to use them. These decisions may affect the amount of energy that enters or leaves the structure because if you leave out the energy your tomatoes will die.",3
150116,You would need to find the right amount of light it needs.,3
150126,First of all my idea is we can make a box oven; but to control the heat we might have to keep taking the box off and putting it back on so the plants don't over heat.,2
150148,idk,1
150135,I will need to see what tem,2
150128,"First, you would need sun absorbent material, which you could stretch over a structure around the tomato plants. You would have to decide how high off of the tomato plants the fabric would be.This would change temperature because if the fabric is higher off of the plants the sun would have further to travel.",3
150144,you would need more sun than cold  you could make a greenhouse,2
150516,I would make a greenhouse because they use the sun. I would use metal to build the greenhouse and I think that would keep all of the heat in it,3
150120,I think that the decisions that you will need to make are that you will need cardboard,2
150121,i will need to make a greenhouse so my plants don't die from the cold and that the greenhouse will help the plants survive but they won't live off the the plants energy there won't be enough. i will need to put lamps and heated lamps to help the plants get the energy that they need to survive.,3
150143,One thing is you need to know is what is the best temperature to grow tomatoes and the amount of water they need to be fed.,2
150146,I need to make sure the plant will directly contain its light source and make sure to take it out only if it just the right temperature so the plant won't die.,3
150141,to make it wide and short because it traps more heat,3
150195,While you create a structure for the tomatoes you need to think what material are you going to use to create the climate tomatoes would grow in in nature.,2
150200,It might impact because it can snow.,2
150198,I think I would need  aluminiam foil mainly because it can actract hear,2
150158,It would need to be somewhere hotter so it could get more energy,3
150159,You would need a place for the sun to shine and a not to cold place.,3
150153,I would put a box made of wood to cover the tomatos then cover the walls in aluminum foil so the heat would stay in then i would put plastic wrap for th roof so the heat could get in.,4
150162,You need to put them in a glass dome and put a fan in there that goes to the perfect temputer for tomatoes to grow.,2
150173,you will need to know what material you will need to use the material might change the energy that enters or leaves the structure.,3
150178,You could make a little house and hopefully it helps.,2
150176,You will need to know how much space you want for the tomatoes and how much sun you want them to receive.,3
150166,The important disicions I need to make are chose some materials that will be halpfull for me.Next you need to make sure your materials work for your tomatoes.Finally picture out how you will build and then get started.,2
150160,You will need to make a building out of glass so the sun's radiation can come through and keep the plants warm.If you make a building out of glass lots of energy will get in the building and it will not be able to get out.,4
150155,??????,1
150172,You may need to put them in a closed area with bright lights so the can be warm and grow the proper way,2
150161,The important disicions i will need to make is that we need to have the amount of energy and for the sun's energy to go derectly at the tomatoes. Also we are going to need to help and put the tomatoes in a safe spot and a place were we will not forget were we left them or were we placed them.,4
150163,You will need to have a wireless heater.,2
150157,it afects it by if there is to butch it will rott or get bad,2
150174,They might kill the tomatoes.,2
150154,One decisions that i will make is i will buy something that the sun is atrackted to. This decisions may affect the amount of energy that enters and leaves the structure by how when it is off the energy might leave.,3
150167,You probably need a solar panel but close off all windows and walls. Put a reliable water supply.,3
150194,You will need to decide what type of structure you want to make . such as if it will be wide and small or small and tall. it will impact how much heat you get.,3
150168,I will need to think of building a greenhouse that has see-through windows.,3
150170,I don't really understand this...,1
150171,I,1
150199,"You will need a giant lamp with a really hot light bolb so the tomatoes can grow, and when they had enough sun you can take them outside when it rains.",3
150196,d,1
150156,sjd modcnakc,1
150243,I need to build some glass so the sun's temperature that is perfect for tomatoes so they can grow quicker and better and the cold air leaves.,3
150204,You need to decide what materials you want to make the structure out of because a material like glass would be better than a material like brick.,3
150244,You need the right amount of energy because if it doesn't get its energy it will die of no power.,2
150219,"As I plan for the structure, I will need to make important decisions like whether it will always be in the sun. That will greatly impact the structure because when it is in the sun, it is receiving direct energy. Sunlight will definitely make the structure heat up.",4
150231,the tempeture is probely moist and wet.,2
150236,I will need to create something that will attract the sun and just the sun and not the cold air.,3
150246,The energy that enters is not that much because wjen its winter its very cloudy.When the energy leaves is alomost all of it because there is no energy putting it back.,2
150240,You need to make sure that the solar oven is correctly mad and shaped and that the weather for growing tomatoes provides enough sunlight.,3
150242,I would make the garden short and wide. It would get more warm air and the tomatoes would live unless we do not water them. I would also set up times to water the plants so they would live. I would finally look at the soil and find the best soil for tomato plants.,2
150218,I have to make sure you plant them,2
150226,You would have to know how hot the sun would make the place,3
150208,You should use glass to help the heat stay into the tomato garden.,2
150235,Making it hot and humid inside might help the tomatoes grow.,2
150220,You will have to build a green house to conserve heat so the plant can handle the temperature.,2
150228,i think you will need to use a air conditioner to make it a little hotter inside the garden. and you will need a light to support it like a sun,3
150223,Well I would make a small building with a lot of windows because it will keep the heat trapped inside the building.The sun's radiation can go trough the windows and heat up the room.,4
150205,it might impact the temperature because it is cold and the tomatoes are too much money to buy and the weather are super cold.,2
150230,you have to make a solar oven but instead of a oven make it a oven make it a  greenhouse.,2
150249,In order for the tomatoes to grow they need a garden the bright light and that are warm because in the winter it is a bad weather for tomatoes.,3
150245,"The important decisions will you need to make that might impact the temperature of the structure are what you will build it out of, what shape it will be, and where you put the structure. These decisions will affect how well the structure works.",2
150203,You should have the building be a see through glass so the sun can hit it.,3
150248,It will affect by the sunlight.,3
150222,I think you should build a greenhouse and depending on the energy going in and out I would say to put the long light bulbs in .,2
150237,if they made a tall a and wide one alot of energy will come in but a tiny amount will get making the tomatoes grow faster but if we make a talk  thin one very littel will come in and if it wont get out,3
150241,The important descision you will need to make is wether  to keep the tomatoes higher for more sun or lower for instant heat needed for growth.,2
150221,What shape will the structure be and how big and tall will it be?,2
150206,Well you would have to find out where you would put it.  Plus you need the equitment and make sure its looked up so no squrils can get in.,2
150247,make it tall and and big,2
150215,use a thimomiter,2
150239,you need to make sure that the cold air won't get into the tomato garden because it will ruin the plants.  You need  to make sure that only heat will get into the garden also,2
150207,I will need to choose a certain material so the tempature will be good,3
150238,If you get a spot that can directly hit into the stem and leafs it could get the sun it needs and make it to start to grow.,3
150214,I think maybe you could make a solar panel and wait for the sun to come and heat the plants up and make the plant hot and then when it rains then the plants will  grow.,2
150089,You will need to know how how hot it is and how cold it is going to be through out the year. You will also need to know where the sun is going to be so you can put the place where you are growing to crops at a perfect angle of where the sun is going to be.,3
150119,The decision I would make if I was in this situation would to make a little garden that has both sunlight and electricity light so when the sun goes down I would use man made light and all this light would just be enough energy for my plants.,3
150202,You may need to put it in a warmer place.,2
150165,You want to put the tomatoes in a sunny place where they can grow but you will have to water them every day and take care of them. If you put them in shade and you water them they will not grow as much because it is not getting energy from the sun. If the tomatoes are in the sun and being watered they will grow and tyhey will taste good but if they are in the shade and not gettinf wattered they will jot be better.,3
149590,these will change the tempiture. it will proberly make an impact because the amount of energy .,2
150648,you will need to decidde what tempurature you want the green house to be.,2
149953,You will have to make the decision of making it big or small and if you should but holes in it for the leaves to come out.,3
150071,"When the temperature would be very hot, then most likely the leaves would dry out and fall off.",2
151162,It needs sunlight and water.,3
150067,you will make the important decision to use the right materials so the heat does not leave the structure,4
150134,You need to keep it outside so that it absorbs more heat. Also you need to have it in good soil.,3
150123,"You will need to plan to keep it outside, so it can have sun and grow. Also you will need to keep it somewhere with good soil.",3
150128,I would make sure the structure is enclosed on all sides. THis would affect the temperature because it would not allow any heat out.,4
150136,"I'd need to build a fairly large and acceptable home for the tomatoes so it could grow and it would assure me it's well being. I'd monitor it and make sure it got the accurate amount of energy from light within the greenhouse, and enough water to keep then dehydrated and healthy.",3
150122,"i need to know where to put it, if it should go in direct sunlight because it would change how warm it gets and how fast it gets warm. What materials to use because that changes how much warmth it can hold and how fast. What is it touching because it will change how fast it heats up.",5
150135,You will need to see what type of temperature that the tomatoes will need before you do the building.,2
150231,we first need to trap the heat so it would not lose heat for the groth.,2
150247,make the room black and and use plexi glass.,3
150215,biuld a green house,2
149959,i will build a thing like at grocery stores and will get the tomatoes watered at the correct time,2
149970,Tall and skinny or wide and short. materials.,2
149967,the leaves have more sun light.,3
149957,"use the greenhouse effect by making a greenhouse,made out of glass.this impacts the temperature by having all the sunlight go inside the house and go on the plants and bounces back and there is a chance the the light might go out but it can also go bounce back for another round and make the plac hot.",4
149961,I think they should use solar powered heat.,2
149954,I would need some type of shelter for the plants and the shelter needs the sun so the sun can hit the shelter so it can be in a average temperature for the plants.,3
150073,If too much energy comes in it might destroy the tomatoes.,3
150078,The building will need bright lights to substitute the sun and some heaters and a hose to help the tomatoes grow faster.,3
150077,"I will need to decide whether the sun has enough energy to make the tomatoes grow. If I don't make this decision, the whether will affect the growth of the tomatoes.",3
150062,"Some important decisions I will need to make is that i will need to make sure that the tomatoes face the sun, make sure that there are no insects or animals, and make sure i make a warm structure for the tomatoes to grow in.",3
150076,Important decisions I will need to make that might impact the weather is to construct a black cloth around the tomatoes. The cloth will prevent a little bit of wind and the dark color can absorb the radiation from the sun.,5
150130,Make a greenhouse to add in the greenhouse effect and keep the heat in to help the tomatoes.,3
150115,You would want to make a structure that doesn't cover the sunlight but that keeps the plant stable.,3
150149,You will have to have all the tomatoes get an equal amount of sunlight. If a structure was going to be built I would use a greenhouse because that uses thin glass that the sun can easily get through.,4
150125,"You will need to make the right decisions because if you make the wrong, you will turn out with disgusting looking tomatoes. To prevent this from happening think of good working materials.",3
150124,If you put the tomatoes in a greenhouse then it will absorb heat and trap it.,3
150177,You will need to make a solar box so you can put the tomatoes inside the box so they will grow,2
150178,You should put the structure in the open were there is nothing because there could be more sunlight to help grow the tomatoes.,3
150198,"Well,I would put then in a nice sunny place that I will remember to tend to.Also,I would try to build a greenhouse mainly for during the winter when it is to cold to grow tomatoes.This is also important mainly because the community garden does not have electricity.",3
150175,Well for example if the structure you build is in the wrong spot like in the shade or somewhere were it actually might be to hot.,3
150161,i will need that the sun can still hit it and water it but i will leave it covered with like a little of leaves so it won't go completely on fire.It wont affect it much to the leaves because the tomatoe will just keep the sun energy to hit it.,3
150196,"i will get a short and wide box and grow the tomatoes, it gets hotter",3
150202,We might need to leave up somewhere warmer so they can grow and not die.,2
150172,You will need some heat bur shade so you need to put it where the sun is sometimes and not other times.,3
150226,I would have a vent that when the hot air rises it can go out and the building will stay cold.,4
150204,You must make sure the temperature where you are building the greenhouse it warm and sunny and not cloudy and snowy.You must make sure you know the measurements where you want to build the structure so that you have enough space.You must also know how much money you have to spend on your structure.you have to decide what you want to build out of becuase glass wil work much bettewr than wood.,4
150223,I think we should use glass so it can trap the heat inside heating up the building and watering the plants with the water that rises and falls also glass will liet the sunlight reach the leaves.,4
150145,you will need ton know how hot and cold it is and also how long it was on the stem,2
149968,I would need to know how big it need to be and how many tomatoes there are.,3
149966,"Where the tomatoes are. If the tomatoes are in a shady place, they won't grow as big or as fast. If it is in a sunny place, it will speed up the process.",3
149963,The decisions may affect the temperature in the structure.,2
149586,Its because it has protein and its healthy for you.,2
149958,You will need to get a budget of how much money you can use. Then you will design your idea and plug the info into the computer to be tested. After that if something went wrong you redesign until you are positive the idea will work. Finally you will get your supplies at or under budget and build.,3
149589,You might have a metal shack with lots and lots of windows. The metal will reflect the heat when it tries to escape.,3
149951,you can leave the tomatoes in the sun so they can grow or leave them in a place with a lot of light .,3
149588,Decisions you need to make are to see when the heat is coming or water or when the heat travels in convection currents and goes out of the structure.,3
149956,To make it hotter you will have to capture the heat so that it will grow and you need to have a sunny spot so it gets energy. Altough there may be not a lot of sun in the winter time traping the heat will help it pretend like there is some sort of sun making it humind. Which then gets hot.,4
149587,You will need to make important decisions. One important decision is where the tomatoes are placed. They need direct sunlight so that they will grow properly and so that they can absorb the heat. Another decision is you must make is what materials you use to make your structure. The heat must be able to go through your structure in order for them to grow.,4
149962,"You would need a lamp, some tomato seeds, and some water. Water and the lamp will help  the tomatoes grow and you need tomato seeds if you are going to grow tomatoes  .",2
149972,"You'll need to know your budget, know where the sun is going to be so you can get the right design, and you need to know what is the most effective material for trapping heat.",4
149960,It would help the tomatoes  to grow faster . the temperature would go up so the tomatoes to grow faster and tasted  better.,2
150217,"The important decisions that you will need to make will be what materials you use , that will make an impact on the temperature.  It will make an impact on the temperature because each material is different than the other. For example, tin foil may be an stronger material than plexiglass.",3
150065,"You will need to stay inside your budget, research the best materials, and make a model.",4
150079,The important decisions you will need to make is how much money will you use to buy the materials for the structure.,3
150061,"I will need to make solar panils to heat up the green house. Most of the heat will stay in, but a little bit will go out.",2
150060,"Since you do not have access to electricity you would need to build a shelter to protect the tomatoes from bad weather, and you might want to use green house glass to keep it at a moist temperature inside and to let the right amount sun light in.",4
150053,you would need greenhouse glass. Greenhouse glass is a special glass that traps the heat in side of the greenhouse.,4
150063,We will have to decide how tall and wide the structure will be because a building with a small opening will not collect as much heat as a building with a large opening.  We will also decide what the top of the structure will be made of. This is important because we need to make sure heat enters the structure and does not go out.,4
150052,Maybe use a plastic roof and something inside to reflect on.These tools will help the tomatos grow in the right temp. and grow correctly.,3
150074,I would need some kind of metal or substance that would let heat be trapped in the structure but I would still need to let heat inside the building. This would be very helpful to me and my colleagues.,3
150055,i will in a garden and a sun or light and a temperature  times line .,3
150064,Well when you make a tomato farm its hard to keep track of the tempichers and the sun will shine different ways so some tomato's will be  different.,3
150057,"We will need rich soil for it to grow, sunlight or solar lamps for it to grow, and water so the tomatoes stay hydrated.",3
150056,The decisions on the amount of energy that enters and leaves the structure is important to the tomato's because you don't want the structure to get to hot or to cold for the tomato's to grow.,3
150070,My stucture for growing tomatoes will be a base with wood around each side so the soil does not fall out and it will be elavated so it gets more sunlight then there will be a window so the sunlight can come in. but a problem is that the sunlight sometimes goes in a different direction than expected so it might not even reach the window on top of the plants,4
150075,"I need to think about what kinds of tomatoes I'm getting, how cold it can be for the tomatoes, and how I will build the structure.",2
150054,"The important decisions I would make are where to put the tomatoes, and to put them in a greenhouse. These decisions will affect the heat by creating a greenhouse effect, which bounces the heat around the tomatoes.",3
150058,you will need liaps for the heat for the temperature for the tomatoes.,2
150111,you need to see what soil to use,2
150108,hit for the.,2
150082,"You might want to add reflectors, put the structure and the plants in the sun, and make sure the materials will work well.",3
150083,First you will need to get the materials you need and to make sure that the cold air doesn't get in your tomatoes and you will probably need to have a little building for your tomatoes.,2
150127,I should make the building clear like a greenhouse so the sunlight can reach the plants inside. I should also make some shiny platforms so the sunlight can reflect into the garden.,4
150117,"I would build a glass structure around the tomatoes because like a greenhouse, they put glass around the plants so the heat of the sun goes in.",4
150516,Some important decisions I will  need to make are if I should build a greenhouse and what materials I will use.,2
150137,You will need to make the structure out of some thick glass so the radiation can get in but it will have a hard time getting the is why you make this a greenhouse made out of glass.,4
150133,A decision I need to make is what would help my structure conduct more heat that will be able impact the temperature. My decision is that I need to make something that will be able to trap the heat in so that the tomatoes will be able to grow. So then my decision would be to make a greenhouse. It will affect the amount of energy that enters and leaves the structure by be able to trap the heat but some might be able to escape.,4
150118,if you just make it like a regular house nothing can get in but if you make it out of glass more solar energy can get in and you need to make the frame out of metal.,4
150121,as i start planning and building a greenhouse it will take time for the greenhouse to be built so i need to put the tomates in a warm place with light so i would use a heat lamp to keep the tomatoes substituted for the sun to help them grow they will probably need the light in the greenhouse  as well.,3
150116,I think the sun's energy will do great work for the tomatoes. You will just need to make sure to always water them and they will do great.,3
150141,A decision that might impact the tomatoes  is that to put black paper around the box so it could attract more heat.,3
150120,you will need people to help you work on the stucture,2
150132,It would definitely need a greenhouse for faster and better growth of the tomatoes. I could also put tinfoil flaps on the house and use hot water to water the plants.,3
150167,The structure needs to be dark whilst there needs to be a water source.,2
150168,The kind of decision I will make to warm the tomatoes is to make the wall into see-through windows for the sun to move through.,4
150170,"Some of the important decisions are willing to follow through with your structure, WIlling to buy all the materials, and willing to put all your time and effort into your structure.",2
150158,you will need the sun so it could grow,3
150173,The impact that might happen is when you put things over is the heat might might be least.,2
150162,I wil make a glass structure for the tamatoes.,3
150155,"one  important decisions are if you want to have it inside or outside. there are many many more.The decisions may impact the way they grow by them rotting, them freezing, and other .",2
150174,You need to make the structure strong and make it not to hot but not to cold. If it is to hot the tomatoes will burn and if it is to cold the tomatoes will freeze.,2
150156,bro,1
150199,You will need to maybe search on the internet what tempature tomatoes need to be at so when you do find out you know how much the tempature has to be at and when to take them out of the sun.,3
150176,You need to know what would be covering the tomatoes so they can get enough sunlight to properly grow.,3
150235,"glass on the roof, like a greenhouse, would let sunlight enter the structure, but not leave.",4
150241,What might impact the temperature of these tomatoes is how high  up  you might decide to put them . This will affect your tomatoes because when something is closer to the ground you have a better chance of growing them properly .,2
150207,We will need a good material of glass sothe heat can come in. We would use a dark color so the house will absorb more.,3
150206,may afect the way the suns angle is at the time of the year,3
150221,"You need to figure out what shape you will make the structure, what material will you use to build the structure, Where you will build the structure and how much heat do you need to grow the tomatoes.",3
150208,I will need to make sure what materials will make the structure trap heat inside of it. These decisions will effect the amount of energy that enters and leaves the structure because it could trap a lot of energy or it could just have the energy leave the inside.,4
150246,"SOme decisions are if you put it in the shade,in the sun,or it gets both because in a green house you will be able to control the sun and shade.",3
150244,You will need radiation for the heat on the tomatoes since they need lots of sun light. You will also need water for the soil so the tomatoes get lots of water.,3
150249,I would build a green house with l.e.d. lights to keep it warm.,2
150205,as i plan the structure for the tomatoes i will use is a solar oven and the heat from the sun and some tin foil to get some heat from the sun.,4
155700,I will need to put the structure where the sun is so the tomatoes can grow and maybe I can put non-electrical solar panels in the structure. It will affect the energy by bringing in more energy from the solar panels.,3
150228,i would build a green house with lights to make it warm.,2
150218,You need to make it in a spot where the sun hits.,3
150242,"We would need to make a glass roof, so the sunlight can get in. We want to get dark soil, so it absorbs heat. We might need a schedule of when to water the plants.",5
150203,If you put the tomatoes  in a cold temperture it will die if it is to hot it will die you have to make sure it get's enough water and enough light.,3
150240,"They need to know the position of the sun, because if the structure they are building is solar power, the sun's rays need to hit the structure in order to use the sun's energy. If the sun's rays are not facing the structure, then the structure will heat up less, which will impact the growing of the tomatoes.",4
150248,The leaves might burn and fall.,2
150237,wheather the building is small and wide or if its tall and short,2
150219,"I will need to pick a place for the structure that gets the most sunlight all day. If it is in the most sun possible, more energy will enter the structure.",4
150220,They should make it so the sunlight can reach the tomato plants but make it so the heat can't leave and the so the cold stays outside.,4
150243,What we need is something that will reflect down to the tomatoes and something that will trap air inside. We need to trap air so it gets hotter and the reflector to reflect heat down to the tomatoes.,4
150230,You will have to build a greenhouse that traps heat in and keeps the tomatoes moist but at the same time not to cold.,3
150222,I think that you should have windows that are tinted so the heat will trap in most likely and make 2 doors with a room so the heat stays in.,4
150238,maybe where you plant them can effect how the temperature will be for the amount of energy it gets in it's leafs and stems.,3
150245,"The important decisions you will need to make that might impact the temperature are how to build the structure, what to build it out of, and where to put it.",3
150214,You could build a solar panel to heat up the tomatoes,2
150239,I need to make sure that none of the cold air can get in to my solar oven and only the hot air.,3
150236,I might need some materials to attract the heat and i need to build something to bring in the heat and let out the cold air. They may affect the amount of energy that enters or leaves the structure because it will keep the heat and the cool air will not be in there.,4
150201,I would like to add to their garden. I would add to the garden so it can  grow is put tin foil inside of the  plastic wrap box then it will reflect off of the tin foil . Then the heat will reflect on the plants.,3
150197,"The important decisions you will need to make that will impact the temperature are how you will use radiation, convection, and conduction and the type of structure you will build. These decisions may affect your solar oven because if you make your structure skinny and tall your temperature may be more steady but less hot. The wide and short structure will lose less heat but will be incredibly warmer.",3
150163,you would need to make it touch the sun for it to heat up and to grow big red tomatoes.,3
150159,You would need to know how much energy the tomatoes need.,3
150160,You will need to use glass to let the heat get in.,3
150165,If you are making a tomatoes garden it will have to be in the sun because if its not it wont get energy to go healthy.It will also have to be watered every day so it will grow big. If it is cold outside you will prombely try to keep it in the sun. Or you can put the tomatoes next to a heater and pour some water in it every day.,3
150154,The important decisions that you will need to make are how you can use the sun to grow when the sun is out.,3
150166,Some important decision  I would make are get the right materials and make sure they will work.Another decision is start building.This would affect by the tomatoes growing.,2
150131,"We will need a short and wide container, with some kind of transparent material to let in the sun. If the container were to have open, no transparent material to contain the heat inside, then the heat and sun wouldn't be able to get the proper amount of sun to the tomatoes. The short and wide or tall and skinny boxes will work just as fine. If you had a short container the tomatoes will not have enough room to grow to its potential height. If we have a tall box then the tomatoes will grow fully.",4
150139,I would make a little green house just for the tomato so no animals can eat the tomatos and i would put some stuff the atractt heat so the tomatos wont get cold and die and get rotten.,3
150140,The sun had to heat up more so that the temperature can go higher for the tomatoes to grow.,3
150144,You could build a greenhouse to attract more heat. But the greenhouse would attract cold temperatures too.,2
150143,You will have to make sure what the the heat doesn't leave but enters in a way. You also need to know how hot it needs to be for the tomatoes.,3
150129,you might have to make a disision that you have to use solar power like the sun.,3
150148,idk,1
150142,a major impact in the temperature is that it has to stay cool for the tomatoes to not rot,2
150138,how much sun light you can trap.,3
150126,We will need to make a solar oven that gets really hot.,2
150090,because if you put a roof on it it will keep the energy in but its harder for it to get in,4
150089,You will need to know how cold it is going to be in the winter and how hot it is going to be in the summer. Also you will need to know where to put the place to make sure they get the right amount of sun.,3
150098,Some important decisions you will need to make that might impact the temperature are that you will need to figure out what materials you will or can use that won't impact the temperature too much or more than you want it too. You also need to figure out what materials you can use that will impact the temperature  just enough so it doesn't impact it too much. These decisions may affect the amount of energy that enters or leaves the structure because the materials or things you do to the structure might make this happen.,3
150093,"i would need plants, soil, shovel, glass, thermometer, light/sun, water/hose, and also if needed decorations to spice it up a little.
These decoration will affect my structure because when you make the structure the plants, soil, and water will make the seeds/plants grow. And we want our structure to work if we want a nice and working structure.",3
150114,we need good soild and water,2
150086,it may get hotter,2
150106,the tomatoes are going to reflect the cold of the electricity of the soil for the tomatoes of the community.,2
150069,You might enclose the tomato to much and it might rot because of the heat.,2
150066,If you build a wooden structure around the tomatoes and leave a little opening than you can heat up the tomatoes for it to grow. It will impact the structure because if you build the structure right than most of the heat will not leave the structure.,3
150072,"If you build the tomato holder to short, more heat comes in and ruins it, if you build it to tall it won't grow much, much if you do it halfway up, you have a good tomato holder.",2
150059,What you actually need is something that will help the inside of were the tomatoes are.This will affect  because if the cold gets in then they will not work or grow.,2
149964,"We will need to make sure that the garden can collect a lot of heat so the plants can grow. Also, the plants would need water, so we would have to collect water.",2
149950,I will have to put the tomatoes in the way the sun is facing so it gets more heat and will get ripper with the heat.,3
149955,You can't have a lot of heat get in or it will die so you would just have to let it outside for a little bit then put it back in.,2
149947,I could put solar panels on the roof of the structure so the energy can be used for a heater.,2
149965,"I would grow the tomatoes under the sun, so the tomatoes can get more heat to grow.",3
149969,You would need heat from a light. Then you would need to build a structure that keeps the heat inside.,3
150650,It my affect because if you're outside covering is not stable the cold air will come through and kill your tomatoes or other plant.,2
149971,no,1
150153,would the whole building be clear or just the top. what materials would I use,3
150195,Some decisions you will need to make if you are making a greenhouse is what you want it to be made of if it is a stone then no sun will get in and it will be useless if you put a lot of sun will go in and it will be functioning so I would chose to make it of glass.,4
150194,Some decisions I might have to make are whether the green house is tall and skinny or wide and short.,3
150164,I should make the structure out of glass and use reflective material for the floor. I should also seal it tight.,3
150200,You will need a structure to cover it.,3
150169,it will efect the plant because it can die if it gats so much cold,2
150101,The sun would impact the temperature because all plants and vegetables need sunlight to start growing. This decision might affect the tomatoes because at night there is no sunlight so the tomatoes might stop growing during then.,3
150105,"As a roof of the structure, you will have to put glass so the heat can stay in, but also come in. You will also have to put something that can conduct sunlight like a piece of metal or something.",3
150112,You will need the building to have plenty of windows and also have some watering source.,3
150085,You will need to decide whether to have reflectors in the greenhouse making heat bounce back and forth or to not have any. Another thing you will need to decide is whether to have a small opening at the top or a big opening.,3
150094,you need to make it short and wide,2
150109,"You will need to know how much sunlight you need in order to have a ripe tomato and not a rotten one, you will also need to know if the amount of  sunlight you are giving the plant is a good amount or a bad amount.",3
150080,you need a good temputur,2
150103,"You will need to make the decision about which material you will use to build your structure and which material will be the most effective. These decisions affect everything, including the amount of heat that enters or leaves the structure. It all really depends on which materials you use and where you place your structure.",3
150097,the important decisions are how you want to make sure there not going to keep them healthy.,2
150095,well it counts on what is the weather and what date did you plant it on too plant it to late it will barely grow plants plant it early the plant will grow really big tomatoes.,2
150087,i would need to know what the shape of the building should be and I should also know how long the building should be.These decisions are important because if I don't think I this sort of stuff the tomatoes might not tern out that good.,2
150096,Yes because the tomatoes will get over heated,2
150084,,1
150104,you will need a large building or at least a long short one like a green house and you will need like a sheet of plastic or cloth to cover the greenhouse to capture the heat in the greenhouse,4
150092,to make pizzia,1
150897,idont know,1
150919,?,1
150924,"if you have to much hot tempetures then the tomatoes will rot,if you have to much cold tempetures the the tomatoes won't grow.",2
151186,I dont know,1
151195,i would build a green house that way if we can see the sun the plants  can too allowing them to grow and the coldness of winter cant breck in so it will be rather a normal tempiture or a hot tempiture,3
151182,the light from the lamps will create some heat that will keep the tomatos safe from the winter,2
151180,I do not now,1
150923,well to impact its temperature would make the tomatoes bad also import decisions is to always almost everyday you must water it.,2
151193,i dont know,1
151230,i think the energy,1
151228,I think is important to the temperature because they give the tomatoes energy and they could grow faster mostly if it rain it will grow faster. when is hot the animals could eat them and they would it work and they are going to be hot. and the tomatoes need a lot of water.,2
151217,green house,2
151227,i think the energy is weak  because the fruit  takes long,2
151218,Atleast try to put it in a room with at least some electricity and some sun.,3
151209,i dot no,1
151213,One important decision that we will have to make is that we will have to disscus how will we get the sun to the plants.,3
151219,this may affect the shores of the energy because the leaves will died like the tomatoes,2
150899,I would need to make sure that the temperature is right for the tomatoes.,2
150900,Move it to a place that has a lot of water and good sunlight.,3
150908,You need to make decision on material you are going to use.,3
150910,the room temp because the tomatoes are going to die,2
150902,The important decisions you will need to do is make the right structure so the tomatoes do not burn.,2
150909,The important decisions that i would make for the right temperature is that you wouldn't want to burn the tomatoes.,2
150904,i dont know,1
150906,i dont know,1
150907,I don't know and all I am writing is this on this question.,1
150905,"You need to figure out what materials you want to use, some materials transfer energy better than others. You also need to figure out what shape the structure will be. A short and wide structure will transfer energy faster than a skinny and tall structure.",4
151224,I would make a greenhouse with solar panels to power the lights or heaters for the tomatoes. This would provide the right temperature for the tomatoes.  I would put sprinklers on the roof that will shootout mist. Doing this will provide water for the tomatoes.,2
151204,you need to  make  the temperature as the same as the other tomatoes.,2
151222,Im so sorry i dont know this,1
151212,I would put the tomatoes in a spot that has the sun clearly showing. I would this because it would let the plant grow from the source of energy which is the sun.,3
151205,you need to decide what type of material you are going to use for the structure.,3
151216,It is important to have a bigger space because then more energy can go into the tomatoes.,3
151203,well the amount of energy might kill the leaves and the tomatoes,2
151215,The tomatoes should be in a green house because its very warm in there and they can survive and maybe be cheaper if there are more of them.,2
151223,You might need to make a heater or something to transfer heat into the room. It may affect it because a heater takes a lot of energy to power up and keep going,2
151208,I need to put the plant in the sun so they would grow.,3
151202,you may want to make it all out of glass for the sun to come in.,4
151206,You will need build a green house.,2
151210,nose,1
151226,It may affect the energy by making more warmer temperature for the structure inside. If you leave the structure it would be cold outside of the structure.,3
151211,You have to put the structure in the right source of heat.If you put it directly on the sun the tomatoes might dry out.But if you put then in a dark place the tomatoes might not grow.,3
151220,"Well, you could build a structure with solar panels to make energy, then put up lights to imitate the sun's rays. If the plants are getting cold and dying due to cold weather, you could put the plants into a big glass container and put some lights in the big containers.  Maybe put a heater in there so you don't get cold.",3
151214,ill put the plant in somewhere that has the sunlight.,3
151231,keep in a green house or in a shady area,2
151207,you make an inclosure with the top open not any of the sides.,3
151229,They need sun shin the structure will need to be long,3
151192,"You need to make sure you have the precise measurement of the piece of land you are building on. Also, you must make sure you have enough tomatoes to fill the whole place up.",2
151188,I would need to make a decision about where to put the tomatoes in order for them to have a better area to grow.,2
151178,"An important decision would to be knowing how dense the material of the building would be, and how thick it will be. Another important decision is where to put a skylight, because it can impact the temperature if you don't put it where the most sun comes in.",4
150915,I will need to check if the sun will be out so I can grow the tomatoes.,3
151199,The plan of the tomatoes,2
151191,the sun gives the plants energy.,3
151196,They can use lamps powered by solar power since they do not have access to electricity.,2
151200,I don't really know because  have never grown tomatoes.,2
151165,It may  affect  all of the tomatoes that they have grown because in the winter the tomatoes don't grow because  the tomatoes need water and sun to grow but on winter they only have cold and frozen because is winter.,3
150921,I don't get this.,1
151194,you need to make molly happy,1
150922,I would make a greenhouse that lets in other plants,2
150917,"You need the right materials to build the structure and the right answer for length, width, and height.",2
151176,You need to know that in the winter the sun is hiding behind all of the clouds.,3
151198,you need to know that in the winter the sun is hiding behind all the clouds.,3
151174,i dont think it is the best choice because the sun does not come out to much during winter,3
150918,I will make a greenhouse and install many glass windows so it gives exposure to the sun shining through.  This affects the amount of energy that enters or leaves the structure because rays of sun will enter through the glass windows to give the tomatoes warmth to grow.  Nothing would leave the greenhouse.,4
151190,i think you should put a window so that the sunlight can get in.,3
151181,If you use a heater it won't do anything except rot them.,2
151201,you need cold temerature.,2
150916,i would  put open roof because the sun rays will come and leave.That way the tomato can grow faster.,3
150920,"you mite need a ruler, weirs or wood",2
151179,We will need to know a good some what sunny spot in the garden and we need to know where it is cold.,3
151225,i don't now,1
150909,"The important decisions that I would like to make are that I would put the tomatoes in the sunlight so they can grow faster and easier, but you would want to water them every day so they don't get dry and burn from the sunlight.",3
150902,These decisions may affect the amount of energy that enters or leaves it because the heat is going into the tomato and the sunlight is making it ripe.,3
150900,You need to make sure the tomatoes get enough sunlight to grow.,3
150910,The energy was from the sun because it was out side.,3
150919,i do not under stan,1
150899,You would need to make the structure out of glass so the heat can get in.,3
150905,"You have to make sure there is a sunroof because if there is not, the plants will probably not get enough sunlight to live. You also have to make sure you add a floor that is a material that attracts heat, so there will be as much heat as possible in the building.",4
151216,You will need to know that the amount of energy that you are using in the place you are putting the structure. This will affect the amount of energy because the sun is putting light on the plant and that is energy so if there is too much energy the plant could die.,4
151208,The decisions that i will have to make are the way that I place the materials. This will impact the energy that its the plants.,3
151225,you need the sun,3
151229,They well need to put them in some where they get heat,2
150917,"It important to decide what materials youll use. If you use the wrong materials, the heat transfer won't be able to go into the structure.",4
151190,if you want them to grow you need the structure to face the sun.,3
150921,You have to use the sun to heat up the tomatoes in a structure.,3
151176,You will need to decide what you will use and how you will make it.,2
150918,"I will build a greenhouse, and I will cover it in glass windows so the sun can shine through.  Also, I will put a furnace in the greenhouse to send heat through it.  The sun will enter the greenhouse and cannot escape, because the greenhouse will never have any doors left open.  heat from the furnace will allow hot air to travel through the greenhouse and allow the tomatoes to grow, and never leave, because just like the the sun's heat, no doors would be left open for any heat to escape.",5
151179,You would want to build it in the desert where it is hot. But also a place with water so not too hot.,2
151177,You will need to talk about how you will build the model.,2
151174,i think that not much energy will get out,3
151200,You need to decide where you want to grow them so they get enough sun light.,3
151196,Use solar powered lights to make more heat.,2
150907,The decisions you will need to make is if your structure colle ts g p,2
150908,You will need to know what materials you are using and where you are building it. If you build out of glass the sun can travel in it but rain can't get in it.,4
150906,You have to make it with the most absorbing matirial there is.If you do you would have the most heat possibel.If you do that you will  have the most the most heat the sun can give you,3
150903,We will need the right amount of sun and the right amount of water. The temperature would be normal and a little hotter but other whys it is fine.,3
151227,the temperature comes from the sun because it heats everything you have to water the plants or from the rain.,3
151220,They could make the gardens outside out of black marble. That would help the building gain the sun rays.,3
151231,you have to rake soil and make it rich so that they can grow.,2
151209,i dot no,1
151230,the temperature comes from the sun because it heals every thing you have to water the plants or from the rain.,3
151223,The decisions that will impact the temperature is actually building the building. It will affect it since science makes the energy hotter or colder.,3
151210,el pager del sol,2
151181,You will need a covering over the tomatoes so it does not effect the temperature.,2
151182,I think try building to make a solar oven to see if it works use ingredients you want to use to make the green house try and make a mini version of it and if it works then build it in the actual version of it to grow your plants,3
151192,You would need to know what your materials would do to benefit the growth of the tomatoes.,3
151195,we will need plexiglass for it to come though and we need a thermometer so we know how much comes in while it is sunny out or dark and maybe there will be warm air to heat up the plants,3
151199,we need to know and have the right amount of heat and rigt amount of non sunlight,3
151186,What materials u will use,2
151191,I will bu,2
150915,I need to make sure to leave the tomatoes out when its hot.,2
151178,"Important descisions that would need to be made would be to have a specific budget to know what you should by, thick walls made of a material that absorb a lot of heat, glass to keep the heat in, but not too thick so heat can come in.",5
151193,i would have to build it tall to reflect down.,3
150922,I would make a building that is completely enclosed and is made from a clear material so none of the other plants in the garden can effect the tomatoes and so that the tomatoes get a brighter light and more heat so they can grow.,4
150916,"you need a garden for the sun rays to, like a glass garden for sun ray to get in but can't leave.",4
151205,I would probably build it with glass and mirrors so heat can reflect off of it's self. Not a lot of heat will escape from this.,3
151206,Important decisions I would make sure that t is like a greenhouse.,2
151203,what i would do is that i would put it in a green house so i can change the temputeres,2
151214,i would cover it when it rains and ill cover it when there is thunder,2
151212,I will try to use aluminum so it can effect the tomato plant more instead of the sun just going directly to the plant. I will also try to get it to the nearest amount of sun that you can possibly get. I will do this because it'll increase the amount of energy the plant gets. I will also try to get a solar oven box and put the plant in the box. These changes are major because it would support the plant a lot more than just having the plant sit there in front of the sun.,4
151202,the decision is that we should put plec glass on top because it will heat up the place.,2
151204,yes because it will help grow tomatoes and the temperature might get to cold or hotter than most times.,2
151207,you have to put it in a good place where you can get to it and it can get good sun light,3
151211,A right place to put it is important.,3
151188,What i will do grow them is put them in a greenhouse and make glass windows so that the sun can get in from the windows.,4
151201,the tomatoes needs to be in hot temerature.,2
151228,you have to put water every day because it will not grew.,2
151215,The sun will go thorugh the windows and onto the tomatoes,4
151219,It may affect the temperature because it could died of cold.,2
136389,You will need to make many decisions when you are building the structure for the tomatoes. You will need to decide what materials you should use to build the structure. I would suggest using glass on the structure. This is because all of the solar radiation that comes into the structure will stay on the structure. You may also want to use black on the bottom of the structure because it will absorb heat and make the structure warmer. If you decided to use white on the structure then heat will reflect and the structure will become cooler. You need to use the right materials so heat will not leave the structure. You also need to put the structure in a place where nothing is blocking the sun away from it. If you placed the structure in a place where there are trees and buildings blocking it then no heat from the sun would enter and the structure would not get warmer to make the tomatoes grow.,5
136373,what i would do is make a greenhouse and or a little house to make them in there and have a temperature heater to see the temperature inside where the tamatoes are making.  ,2
136377,not giving the tomato enough of sun may make it raw and change the way that it might look and change the way it will taste ,2
136366,Well first off you need to make sure that when it's raining out side not too leave it out there to long or else they will get gross and moist also when the sun is out you need to take advantich and keep it in the sun. ,2
136356,I think it will heed to have the glass there is in a green house because the tomatoes are going to need a lot of heat during the winter. So we'll have to give it as much heat and it will get trapped inside. This affects the temperature because without the greenhouse glass the heat will escape. But if we do have the greenhouse glass then the heat will get trapped in and warm up the tomatoes.,4
136363,I would use black-colored fabric on the INSIDE to make it warmer. I would also use a good insulator to keep the heat in. ,4
136375,Have a glass roof is a must have. Having black walls inside is important. These are important because the greenhouse has no electricity so they would have to do this in order have the structure heat up. ,3
136370,You will need to use glass or pexi glass to trap the heat into the green house. You might use these things so you can trap all the heat in.,3
136391,What I will do the make a structcue for the plants would be a copy of a green house but with instaled heaters and things like fountains to water the  plants,2
,,1
,,1
,,1
136404,"A glass roof would help conduct solar energy, and solar energy (or the sun's light) shows even in the winter.",3
136411,solar panels and Plexi  glass. because the plexie glass will trap the heat and  the solar panels will attract heat.,3
136400,You will need to make a greenhouse so the heat will stay in the greenhouse.,2
136460,Your decisions make a big effect o the tomatoes growing. If it's to cold the tomatoes will not grow and may even freeze. if it's to hot the tomatoes won't grow and also might wilt. You must ask yourself if foil will be to reflective. Or how can I place this were the sun can reflect it.  ,3
136476,I think if you were to put the tomatoes in a green house they might grow because the sun will heat from the sun will heat the green house. Also the If the power goes out in the house the room should be all nice and toasty.,2
136462,The builing should be a greenhouse with glass walls and roof. I says this because when the heat is trap in the window the tomatoes will grow. Also the glass is a good condutoir. ,3
136504, If said that you cant use a lot of electricity so you need to have something that does not have electricity . So you also need to use something that can give a lot of heat so black .So it can absorve  the heat .,4
136500,"The important decisions I will need to make that might impact the temperature is albedo, and  greenhouse gases. These decisions may affect the amount of energy that enters or leaves the structure by how albedo says that black absorbs heat and white reflects heat. The greenhouse gases are the what holds in the heat.",4
136490,I would put the tomatoes in the sun and so when it rains it will get water and when it is sunny it will grow. I would also have a drape that would cover the tomatoes when it rains to hard and when it is to hot. If this does not work I would make a little solar house that fits the tomatoes and will help them grow.,2
136505,"We will need to decide the positoning of the plant, so it gets the most sunlight, and where it will be placed so it can get sunlight, and not be covered in shade.",2
136509,Because if you put your tometos in s buling with no light it will never grow.,2
136519,I might put the tomatoes in a green house so they could get the heat and so they wont freeze. Also so sun rays could get through but the weather out side went get in.,3
136495,"In your tomato structure,an important decision would be the color of the outside of the garden and if it should be clear or not. If they want a higher temperature, they should probably use a darker color. If they use glass for the outside, lots of energy will get in, and not a lot will be let out, which makes it a pretty good option for the structure.",4
136550,"I would say use something clear, if you use something clear it will let in light but it'll be hard for it to leave. Also, something reflective such as metal or aluminum around the walls will reflect more heat around the place.",4
136572,,1
136557,A greenhouse is ideal because the stained glass can keep the heat in. The door is closed so the heat doesn't escape.,3
136563, Build a greenhouse to trap the heat and keep the tomatoes warm.,2
136518,"You need to build a structure in a place where a lot of sunlight hits the structure so they will grow good. You will want to have a mirror-like object in the structure too. You will even need to figure out how to make a greenhouse or solar oven that will trap the heat inside. You will also have to use a good material for absorbing sunlight. You will probably need solar panels to convert solar energy into radiant energy. This could affect the amount of energy that enters and exits the structure because if you put it in a spot that doesn't get much sunlight, the tomatoes probably won't grow.",3
136381,"My decisions are to make a substance that reflects light. And the substance has to be at a certain angle to hit the tomatoes and warm them up. Those decisions will help because when the heat is reflected, it will shine on the tomatoes and give them sunlight, and heat.",3
136359,You will need to have a black box since it is cold you need to make it black so the box can absorb any type of heat it can get. ,4
136372,put aluminium foil going all around the tomatoes which are facing the tomatoes to reflect the heat into the tomatoes.,3
136382,"One important decision will to make the greenhouse out of glass. If I do this than all the sunlight will be able to pass through the glass heating everything inside, trapping the heat in, and no heat is lost through conduction because glass is a bad conductor of heat. My second step would be to add insulation to the green house, so that no cold air can get in through the cracks of the greenhouse, and it also adds more protection to keeping the heat in.",5
136683,some of the bigest parts in clud what moteral you yous and how you yous it like if you yous plastic rap or alumon foule like if you yous the plastic rap it could afect the heat like putting it on top could mack it hotter ,3
136390,"Some decisions that you would have to make is where are you going to plant your tomatoes( like in the shade or the sun etc). Another decision that you would have to make is how many times you water it a day.
Lastly another decision you would have to make is what you would plant it in,( A pot in your house or under ground,or in a bush.) These decisions may affect the amount of energy that enters or leaves the structure because how many times you water it will affect it , water gives plants and humans energy and without water you or it can die if you water it a lot then it affect the energy. Another decision that may affect how much energy that enters and leaves the structure is where you plant it in the sunlight or in a shade, this affects the amount of energy leaves and goes into the structure because the sunlight gives the plant energy to grow putting it in the shade would not give it as much energy as putting it in the sunlight.  ",3
136388,"Important decisions you will need to make that might impact the temperature are the color of the outside structure, windows, curtains and color, carpet or tile, and the color of the inside. The color of the inside and outside may make it hotter, the windows will allow sun in, the curtain will hide the windows making the inside warmer, carpet will soak up heat making the structure hotter and tile will make it cooler.",3
136362,"If the decisions are bad then the tomatoes will not grow if they are good they will grow well.. Just like our solar ovens we had to find good ways to keep in the heat, reflect it and many other things. The decisions will help grow on the idea and make it better and which means you can have a better result.",2
136374,You will need to make a certain box that can reflect enough heat and absorb enough to the point where it isn't too hot but just right.,3
136380,You could make a greenhouse so the light can still go inside. You could also buy a heat lamp or something that will heat up the greenhouse. ,2
136378,Maybe you can use a strong bright light that will keep the plants warm at night and then during the day the light can turn off.,2
136367,well my dissension is going to be a greenhouse. the green house is going to have Plexiglas all around the greenhouse and a door.this may change the temperature because when the sun rays hit the glass and coming in the sun rays will stay inside the greenhouse causing warm temperatures to grow the tomatoes ,4
136352,"  Some decisions you need to make are what colors is the room or garden going to be, if it's a room where would the heat come in and how will the sun be attracted in that area. If it is inside a room you can use lack paint on the walls and windows for the roof so it can attract more light and heat. If it is not in the room you can have long metal boxes holding the plants and make it a dark colored metal so more heat could be attracted but it would be better if you put the garden in a room.",2
136360,put all the tomato plant in a plant building garden thing and make the outside black to take in the heat and give the tomato energy.,3
136379, One decision that I would make is that I would big reflectors. Then the solar radiation can reflect onto the tomatoes. ,4
6971,The first step would be is finding a place hot/cold= warm to plant the tomato.,2
136368,You will need windows or a window because you will need the heat to come through to the tomatoes. Have the tomatoes high up in the structure so the hot air will rise and affect the tomatoes. You will probably have to consider the shape of the structure so that the heat will stay in better and i think a wide and tall size would be the best. You might also want to add cardboard inside for more heat.,4
136364,The structure of the building has to be insolated for heat to be trapped when it is inside. it also has the have sun comeing in the the building.,4
136384,I will have to use a type of plastic that allows heat to get in and be reflected on the inside. I will also need to make sure that the structure will seal and not allow the heat to escape. I think this will allow heat to get in and stay in therefor keeping the structure heated.,4
136393,"If the community garden builds a greenhouse for their tomatoes, they will have to make sure the greenhouse can let in the heat, and let out as little as possible. They don't have electricity, so they have to use all the heat from the sun possible. ",2
136413,"I would put in in the sun, inside a greenhouse",2
136394,I would build a greenhouse that can trap the right amount of heat that the plants could survive off of. This may affect the amount of energy the tomatoes have because it is not use to the different climate.,2
136405,I would make a structure what would have four tall walls with a flat roof that has two glass windows. The outside color would be green and same for the inside. There will be tinted windows all around the walls. ,3
136423,"have a glass sealing, paint the outside ofthe building black and the inside white. ",3
136398,I will need to look into what solar pannels or something will collect the most heat and sun for the tomatoes to grow. You can use a greenhouse with solar pannels on top to collect heat and stay trapped.,2
136414,"One important decision is what color the inside of the greenhouse is, and how many windows there are. ",3
136408,You would need to maybe use a reflective flap like an aluminum flap to reflect the light that hits it down towards the building. It would also be a good idea to use dark colors on the inside to attract the light and make it hotter. Using glass would also be a good idea because it will trap the light inside and make it more intense.,3
136420,I would make sure there is a way sunlight can reach the tomatoes and that the heat can't be let out. This will help them get the right amount of heat they need to grow.,2
136419,I think that building a sort of green house will be the best idea because the heat will be trapped in the building giving the tomatoes.,2
136424,The color of the structure will impacted the temperature because if it is bright it will reflect more heat but if it is dark it will absorb more heat.,4
136392,We will build a greenhouse for the tomatoes and put it into the sun and that sun's radiation will transfer into the greenhouse as it heats up and the tomatoes won't get frozen. The greenhouse and sun will impact on the temperature into the tomatoes. The sun's energy will enter into the greenhouse and some will reflect out so it doesn't get to hot and dry the plant.,4
136426,"make a solar box thing that would reflect the suns rays, and bounce them in the tomato. ",3
136685,I would have to decide what the structure is made out of. If I make it out of plastic it could melt.I would also need to find out how big I need to make it. If it is to big there will not have room for other plants and if it is to small it will need to be bigger so it can hold the the plant.   ,3
136403,Important decisions I will need to make are how I am going to get the sun to heat up the building where the tomatoes are growing. Another important decision I will need to make is I need to make sure the building is in the right spot in order for the sun to be able to heat up the structure and get the tomatoes to grow.,3
136422,"I would put the tomatoes in the sun, in a box with plastic wrap over it because the heat will go inside and heat the tomatoes up and some heat will reflect. I would also use a tall and skinny box for the tomatoes.",3
136416,some questions you might have in mind would be that to choose glass or plastic wrap personally i would choose 2 sheets of plastic wrap due to experiments.   ,3
136425,,1
136395,You will need to choose objects with a low albedo (black) so that they will reflect very little of the heat absorbed. You will also need a structure that is shaped to absorb as much heat as possible. You need to have an enclosure that can easily absorb heat and also retain it.,4
136474,"I think there should be reflective things on the inside except for the roof, with plexiglass on top.",3
136467,"You need glass at the top and sides, you need dark colors to stain the glass to absorb as much heat as you can. you might need metal rods to hold things up",4
136463,One important decision I would have to make is what I would use to trap the heat. Picking this is important because not every material can trap heat very well.,3
136483,The structure I will make is a garden house with solar panels so the heat can come from the solar panels and give the tomatoes warmth and sunlight for it to grow.,2
136461,The top will be glass so the light will be trapped inside the house and wont be able to leave so the plants will have enough energy to grow.,4
136465,The cold weather will afect the tomatoes because it will not survie. The totmatos will freeze or rot.,2
136459,You will need to make sure that the tomatoes are being grown in a good area with not too much heat and not too much cold but just enough to where the tomatoes will be able to grow. These decisions will help the tomatoes grow because the way they grow can affect the way they taste and look so they are going to need the best shade they can get. ,2
136485,Decision i will have to make is if it will contain enough energy inside if i buy glass . Make a plan of how it is going to be how will it make it grow. How it affects is that there's no electricity because without it how would you have the sun's reflecting your solar panels also it's cold and identically that won't help a lot for tomatoes to grow it might help a little but not a lot . ,2
136455,"First of all, I already know that I'll be needing to provide the right environment for tomatoes to grow. It's already bad enough that the garden is out of reach of electricity, so I only can hope to depend on the sun.",2
136453,I would first choose to make the structure out of glass. The glass will conduct the sunlight but prevent it from leaving. This will increase the buildings temperature.,3
136477,,1
136517,"You need to decide what type of insulation you will use, what type of glass you will use, what colors there are, how the structure is shaped, and where it is facing. These decisions will impact the tomatoes by deciding how much radiation, conduction, and convection takes place.",3
136496,make a sturdy pole and in a bright area  ,2
136489,"We would need to have something to trap the heat, like greenhouse gases. ",2
136511,make it higher off the ground so that the air has more moister and warmth in the air to help grow.,3
136499,"You will need to make sure that the sun's radition can actually get into the greenhouse, you also need a reflectivity source, and a make sure the temperature isn't too hot or too cold.",4
136506,"You could use dark colored materials like black(mainly) to absorb light and heat, or maybe even metal to conduct the heat from the sun. You could also use glass to create convection. This will affect the garden dramaticly because most of the heat will be trapped and secure in the greenhouse.",3
136497,Some is how will you get the sun into the right amount.,2
136508,The decisions may affect the amount of energy because maybe there is a lot of heat coming in that can't get out because of your structure or maybe there isn't enough heat so the tomatoes can grow healthy.,2
141563,the wide box helps the tomatoes get a hight temp because its big for the sun.,3
136501,"Some important decisions that may affect it are, having a glass that keeps in the heat radiation from the sun, and does not let it out. That would affect it because, that way, more heat would already be in the structure, and there would not have to be a lot extra.",4
136493,"The material that the structure could affect the temperature. If you choose something that conducts heat well it could make the temperature go up. If the structure is very big it could cause the temperature to go down. If the structure is a dark color the temperature will, but if it is a light color it could go down in heat.",4
136512, Maybe the height of the structure or maybe the materials used would effect the heat or the energy.,3
136503,There will be a insulated structure to keep the heat in with two windows on the roof. These will affect the heat because the keep heat in.,4
136498,Some important decisions are you will need wood and then paint it over with white paint so the greenhouse does not get hot for the tomatoes to absorb the heat and get dried out. You will also need glass for the windows. ,4
136520,The magnification of light is the most important I say this because the more magnified the light is the more focused and hot the light becomes this is because the molecules when more concentrated have a lesser radius of movement and friction witch speeds the molecules thus creating more heat.     ,2
136494,The tomatoes should be under the sun but not get so much heat because they might die if they get too much heat. The tomatoes will also need to be watered so you will need some type of water source to use.,2
136514,"The important decisions I will need to make in order to let the tomatoes grow is going to be , to build a green house to plant the tomatoes since it is going to be cold outside. Inside the green house there is going to need to be lights and a heater to help the plants grow.",2
136522,"I will have to make sure I use a good insulator to build a solar greenhouse because then all the heat will not escape when it is cold. If I put something on the top of the structure such a plastic or glass, it will direct a lot of the heat inward which could be very useful.",4
136558,You should keep them somewhere where there is sun so the grow but you also need to water them.,2
136567,"I will make the decision of making a small greenhouse,a large greenhouse,and bigger greenhouse.",3
136555,Important decisions to make might be where to put the garden because if you put it in a shady place it will get cold  but if you put it in a place where there is a lot of sun exposed the garden could heat up and be a place for the tomatoes to grow. ,3
136571,Try to make a greenhouse because in any temputure thoses can be warm enough to keep yoour things alive.,2
136551,"Well, I think if you put a cage then a colored planter box then the  infrared light ",2
136566,The roof will be out of a glass so heat can go in. Also the heat will be on the the leaves too.,3
136549,We could get pixie glass instead of regular glass because it is like plastic and it would be easy for it to get hotter because plastic gets thing hotter when touched by the sun. The if there is more heat there is more SR to enter the leaves. I know this because in the wise project we designed a box that had pixie glass and it had a lot of SR.,3
136355,"For the structure, I would build a greenhouse because they can absorb a lot of light and heat. If I do build a greenhouse, the tomatoes would grow well because it would get humid in there so that means there is a lot of heat. Since there's normally a glass roof on the greenhouse, light would be able to come in easily. ",3
136492,"Will the temperature kill the tomatoes because the temp., might be two hot and building a low budget solar panels.  This decision might affect growing the tomatoes.",2
136361,To get the tempature to rise you will need a Plexiglas roof so heat can get in and something whit on the walls to reflect the heat. You also might want to put solar panels by the structure so if you do get sun tou can store the energy for when there is no sun.,4
136354,If there is glass not as much sun light will come in but more heat will stay in.I will have to be careful because i wont more radiation to be able to come in.,4
136387,One important decision that is needed to make the structure warmer is glass. The glass will allow heat into the structure and let very little heat out.  You also need the structure to be large so that you can get more rays from the sun into your structure.,4
136369,If I were to make a huge solar panel nearthe greenhouse were i'm putting my tomatoes in the solar panels would absorb a lot more of the suns radiation and it might change the amount of energy and temperature thats in the greenhouse.,2
136351,These decisions would effect the amount of energy because you have to find the midle where there not to cold but its not burning hot.,2
136421,You want a dark color on the inside and glass onthe top so the heat comes through the top and gets traped in the dark color.,3
136397,,1
136412,"1 deceshion is to  grow them in a greenhouse.
A 2nd way is to grow them in a solar oven. ",2
136399,the tomatoes will need heat to grow ,2
136402,You have to plant it where then sun is hitting it just right so it will get the right amount of heat. Also you need to water it the right amount of water to make it grow.,2
136396,I will put my tomatoes in a box with black covering=g so it will attract heat and be stuck and heat the tomateos,2
136407,"Add glass, and dark walls.",3
136406,,1
136417,,1
136410,materials like using glass and wood instead of metal so light can pass through the glassandthe wood wont get hot.,3
136409,,1
136450,Having air holes to let the plants breathe will let the heat escape. You will need the right cover put on correctly to make sure no heat can escape that way.,4
136451, the most important decisions you need to make are what materials to use and if the are good at absorbing,3
136468,The stucture i have in mind is to make it wide and short so the suns reflections get in and some of them can get out but that's okay.,3
136480,,1
136482,,1
136457,"Material and color of the structure - as well as design - may take a big impact into the temp. If we make it too warm, we may have cooked/rotten/shriveled tomatoes. Too cold, we don't get tomatoes.
If we use really good insulating materials and dark color, heat will stay inside inside the structure. But it may be too warm.
Using too good of materials that can conduct heat may make the inside of the structure too cold.",4
136456,"I need to make sure that I put it in a place where the sun shines evenly down and bright. I will also need equipment to conduct, insulate, and reflect heat and light. ",2
136454,you should paint the wood out side black and water them 2 times a week. ,3
141561,Things that you need are solar panels to get the sun to make it warmer for the inside.,2
136475,The sun can effect the plants because the sun can burn the plants and they need food like us there food is the dirt,2
141559,you can build a green house the reason is because the green house allows heat to come in and not out and as for the energy the heat can be your energy sourse.,2
136481,I would make the structure mostly glass and place it in area where there is most sun shining.,3
136469,"They can use a greenhoudse because the energy comes from the sun and thats what they need. A greenhouse will help grow tomatoes because it will keep all the air inside and it will not esape t
like the wide open.",2
136507,"The structure must be made out of roper greenhouse glass and insulators, the greenhouse will also need solar panels to power heating lamps. The greenhouse will need to be placed in a spot where the sun can reach it, it will also need to be checked daily to monitor the condition of the plants and the greenhouse itself.",3
136502,They should make a green house with walls and a slanted glass roof so if snow falls the snow will slide off and the sun won't be covered (Unless there is clouds) .,2
136515,You will need darker color like black because it absorbs heat unlike lighter colors. You would also need light from the sun to heat the room up.,4
136553,,1
136583,"You would need to have a awning to keep sunlight smooth, a watering system, and a stand for the vines to grow.",2
136546,Materials and placing of those materials are important when building a structure to keep heat inside,3
136574,,1
136570,,1
136569,,1
136580,"Some decisions I would have to make would be the color I would need to make the structure and what I would want to make it look like. These decisions  would effect the amount of energy that enters the structure because the would have to be dark to get the ""suns attention"". It would also have to heat up the green house.",2
136564,"We will need to decide whether we want to use materials like aluminum foil, plastic wrap, plexiglass, and other materials.  Materials like plastic wrap will keep heat inside the structure.  Aluminum foil can help reflect heat into the structure.",3
136559,"The surroundings might have to be black, glass for sun to shine through, and not have a lot of holes for the heat/sun to get through. Black=heat Glass=a little bit more heat No Holes=more heat.",3
136561,,1
136576,,1
136556,"I would put wooden poles all over the garden, then I would put a semi-light semi-dark sheet on top of them. I would also add one door. These decisions may effect the amount of energy that comes and leaves the garden because the sheet would make it warmed and since there are poles all around it, it would be hard for the heat to leave. The door would be controlled by humans, and when you  open the door heat would leave. ",3
136560,,1
136389,"When you are building the greenhouse, there are there are a couple of decisions that you will make. One is where you should build your greenhouse. If you do it in a place that has trees or buildings in the way, the greenhouse will not work. The light will not be able to enter. Another thing you need to think about when building a greenhouse, is what material you should use. If you use glass, then heat from the sun will get trapped in there. This is good because that is the only type of energy you can use. If you use the wrong material, then too much air can escape or not enough will enter. ",2
136362,Where the sun shines always to get it to shine in tomatoes. Then more heat gets transferred in. You will need it to be dark around tomatoes so that the heat is absorbed.,4
136368,You could either have windows for the plants or you could have solar panels for energy. The problem for the windows are if you don't have the sun for a bit of time then will it effect the growth. If you have solar panels they will be hard to set up but you can have stored energy.,3
136372,Make a heat oven because it attracts heat to it.,2
136352,You can use a dark metal as the wall and a glass roof so light can come in. You can also paint it black so the room absorbs more heat.,4
136382,"I would make the green house out of glass so lots of heat could come in through the windows. I would also insert insulation in any crevasse of the green house so all cold air stays out, and that all the warm air stays in.",3
136374,I need to be able to have a sealed environment covered in dark colors such as black.,3
136356,So the decisions I might have to make is to not let into much sun and water is every day so it gets the water it needs. Also it would be in a greenhouse so the heat could be trapped inside.,2
136370,"You maybe will need some kind out glass like a green house, that protects the tomatoes. You will also need a heating thing in there so it is warm enough for them.",2
136354,I will have a green house and i will have water so when the sun come's the water will evaporate and became moister so the plant get water and sun for growing,2
136367,you could put the tomatos in the greenhouse and the sun will refect and give a lot of light.,3
136388,You will need lots of windows for the sun to come in the summer and spring. In winter and fall you will need to have dark curtains. Dark curtains absorb more sunlight making the room hotter for the tomatoes to grow.,4
136683,how to vind lives or you can have soler power wire would we put it how would it work,2
136369,I would have to build a bid solar panel for the energy i need for what i'm going to build. Depending on the weather is how much energy we will produce. the solar panels will take the suns energy so it might lower the temperature.,2
136378,I don't know but maybe put all the tomatoes in a greenhouse I am not sure.,2
136359,,1
136390,,1
136375,You may need a black wall or floors to make the walls absorb all of the heat. Also you will want glass celings to make the heat come in but not gome out like the green house. ,4
136384,You will want a good insulator and conductor to absorb heat and keep i tin the structure,4
136387,You need a large dark object inside of the structure and you need to have shiny objects surrounding the dark object.  He dark object will obsorb the radiation coming from the sun and the shiny objects will make the particles bounce around causing heat.  You will also need to surround the garden in glass.,4
136366,Important things tomake is to make sure if when it rains make sure not to keep them out htere for too long.,2
136363,I would need to put in an insulator to keep in whatever heat is in the room. I would also have to choose dark fabrics to absorb whatever heat is in the building.,5
136373,We would need to put it in somewhere where it doesnt have a lot of heat and somewhere where the sun hits it a little.,2
136360,Yor iether gonna put the plants in the sun and take them back after a while to water them or us solar pannel to heat them.,2
136364,you could put the tomatoes in a green house and the suns rays will go down and hit the green house will a lot of light.,3
136380,A good insulator would help keep the heat and make the tomatoes grow faster.,3
136391,I would build a structure like a green housethat blocks out high temp and very bad snow weathers like if  it was really bad sunny day I would make its so the light would get reflected of the green light so it does not kill the plants . If it was something really bad I would just make another layer of the struatcure.,2
136379, You might have to get something to reflect light onto the tomatoes.,2
136377,it will effect it by not growing the way it is supose to grow ,2
136381,"I think we should put something that might reflect the sun. I think that would be a good idea because if it reflects the sun, the heat goes into the tomatoes. ",3
136361,If you build a structure that has to much or not enough shade the plants will die. you also want to make sure that the structure is not to tight so the plants could grow.,2
136685,Most plants need the sun to grow. So I could build a solar energy powered thing to heat up the area. ,2
136419,An important decision that is needed for the structure is that it needs to let heat energy in but not out.,3
136415,you cant have the area to hot or to cold other wise the leaves will die,2
136395,"You need to build a structure in a place where a lot of sunlight hits so they will grow. Also, you will probably need solar panels to convert solar energy into radiant energy. This may affect the amount of energy that enters and exits because if you put it in a spot that doesn't receive much sunlight, they probably won't grow.",2
136393,"You will need to make sure if you make a building to put the tomatoes in, you will make sure the sun is capable of getting in to warm the tomatoes to the right temperature. ",3
136408,You would need to make it so that UV rays can enter easily by maybe adding more windows.,3
136421,Maybe use glass for the walls and roof.,3
136404,"I should plant the tomatoes inside a green house. There will be conducters on the roof that suck up solar energy and beam it at the plants, so they will get sunlight.",2
136420,you need to make sure the tomatoes are in an enclosed area so the heat won't escape as easily. Also you need solar panels to collect the right energy needed to grow the plants.,3
136414,"When building a greenhouse, it traps radiant energy for the tomatoes. ",3
136392,We will need the right building and kind of glass that can absorb the right amount of energy and keep it in there. If we can get enough energy from the sun we will be able the grow them good. We also need the building to be at a specific place.,4
136397,I will need to make the temperature moist. I need to make it moist so that the plants get enough sun but also enough water.,2
136424,and important decision is the color of the structure because if it is a light color it wont absorb as much heat as a darker color.,4
136423,you could use dark colors to paint the outside. this would make the inside alot warmer for the tomatoes.,3
136403,The structure that you need to build is a green house. I will need to make sure that there is enough space for the sun to come in that way the sun will make the green house at the perfect temperature in order to grow the tomatoes.  ,3
136412,"you have to make sure that, you have something that gives it just enugh heat but not so much that the tomatos burn.",2
136407,Build a greenhouse to trap radiant energy for the tomatoes.,3
136411,IS IT GOING TO BE INSIDE. BECAUSE THERE IS MORE ENERGY OUT SIDE THAN IN,2
136402,You will have to put it in the correct area to give it the correct sun light.,3
136400,You would need to make the structure all glass so that the energy will stay inside the structure.,3
136406,Have a little house with the tomatoes and have a black frabric on a dark tarp and put around the small house.,3
136405,The major impact the color black will bring in more heat. You could also put solar panles. Since they both bring in heat it could keep the temp warm witch helps crops grow. Also you will need to build a green house to keep them or a box or just a place that has four walls.  ,3
136416,tilt a glass window towards the sun to magnifie the radiation,3
136409,Glass used on greenhouses will trap heat inside for plants.  If this glass is used the temperature will increase inside the structure.,3
136398,You will have to see what is the best way to collect the sun's heat and energy without letting the cold in. Maybe use solar panels and greenhouses. This will affect this plant because it will make it grow.,2
136418,They need the right temperature so the Tomatoes can grow and live ,2
136399,IT will grow more tomatoes when the sun hits it the most,2
136417,It will effect it by the growth of it.,2
136425,You would probably need a greenhouse and windows to trap the sunlight and heat the room. This is a good decision because they will get a lot of sunlight and grow quickly.,3
136394,"I would build a green house than would trap enough heat for the tomatoes to grow.
",2
136422,I will put my tomatoes in a greenhouse and put solar panels so heat from the sun will come in but some little heat will come out so its not hot.,2
136410,Important decisions that you need to make are what materials to use and how big is the structure going to be and how many plants are going to be inside.,3
136396,You will need to make sure that your tomatoes will get a lot of heat and warmth because without thoose it wont be able to grow and when they don't grow they will die ,2
136426,"Make a heating box, so the sun would make the tomato's grow.",2
136413,You will maybe need solar panels or get a glass that can absorb and reflect light. The glass can keep the suns light and help the tomatoes.,3
136453,"You first would need something to reflect the light into the structure, like a greenhouse. Since it is reflecting the light it is giving the tomatoes energy.",3
136451,Have thick insulators keeping cold out. It is also trapping heat in.,4
136462,So I think we should make a house that has glass roof and a solar panlle. So when the heat comes in the house it will heat up the tomtoes and the sloar power will let the sprinlers water them. ,2
136481,Probably using a greenhouse because the glass keeps the heat inside to have the right temp. ,2
136460,Well tomatoes can't have it to cold or to hot. You need t figure out a way were you can let enough light energy in to have a warmer environment for the tomatoes but not to warm were they might die and get wrinkly. ,3
136457,"I would need to make a decision on what material I would need to build the wall of the structure. I would also need how to decide how the sun would keep the structure warm and cool for the tomatoes. They will may very on the color and how good of a conductor or insulator it is. If it's a good insulator, I may be able to keep the interior a good warm temperature and keep it that way. If it's a dark color, heat will be absorbed.",4
136459,"You need to make sure the tomatoes are in good condition and you should probably have them in the shade because the heat can affect the way they may taste. If you have them in the shade then your probably going to have a better expense just at that because, it's probably going to affect the way the taste not only but look and feel. ",2
136476,I would build a green house to keep the hot air in and the cold air out.,2
136456,"You need a good place for your structure, sunny and warm. Good absorbers, green house glass? Having good conductors is important for how much heat is in the structure. Also you need a good environment and temperature to grow your crop.",3
136483,WE could have a garden house with solar panels to make sure the tomatoes grow healthy. ,2
136463,"Some important decisions I would have to make would include, what I am using to grow the tomatoes in, what color it is, and if it can hold the heat in.",3
136450,You want a reflective material to keep the heat inside of the structure. You also want a UV light to make sure that the plants will grow.(to replace the sun),3
136482,,1
136467,You need a good heat conductor so you get a lot of heat. You also need something  black to absorb heat.you also need something to trap the heat in.,4
136454,How to make sure that there is not to much heat and the tomatoes get dry or die.,2
136465,It needs sunshine and shade. You need shade to keep the plants cool. You need sun for the plants to grow. ,2
136477,I will make a house for the tomatoes and put all the energy.,2
136468,To keep the temperature inside of the tomatoes we should build a small structure of a tower the heigth if a tree so the grow even bigger,2
136461,you will have to make a little inside farm and make the top of the house and the walls a very dark color because there is still a little bit of light in the winter from the sun so that could make it a good temperature and the snow would melt to give the plants water to grow and become very ripe and delicious.,3
136475,"well plants live just like us they need dirt,sun,water,and some shade to help them grow.",2
141559,well you could posibly build a green house because it traps heat and lets n cold in.,2
136485,,1
136452,You might make a greenhouse to conserve heat energy. It won't change anything because the temperature didn't change.,2
136471,you will need to build a sun house and put bright lights in the sun house.,2
136474,"If I put black on it, it might be too warm. I think white would be better because it doesn't absorb as much heat. I will make a white greenhouse with a glass roof.",4
141560,,1
136469,The decisions will acffect the amount of energy leaves or enters the structure will affect the way the plant grows like how long it will take.,2
141561,this affects it because if its to hot it can make it so it will grow but die and if its to cold it wont grow ,2
136480,"Well they should build a Greenhouse, then transform the tomatoes into your greenhouse so they grow well.
And the energy that leave the leaves well be very dehydrated well need lots of water because they are going to be in a very hot enviroment.
",2
136464,I would add solar panels to the top of the green house for electricity. And that will give us the opertunity to have the right temperature. And that is what I would do.,2
136455,"Maybe if you create a small shack or shelter, or tree/greenhouse, the sun will be able to reach the tomatoes so they will be grown well and correctly in a good circumstances.",2
136492,Well I would,1
136500,The important decision that will impact the temperature is to wear to build the structure. like wheres the best place to put the structure. We would also need to make sure we had the right material. These decisions may affect the amount of energy that enters or leaves the structure by either making my tomatoes really ripe or making them really bad.  ,4
136494,"Some important decisions you will have to make are deciding where your going to plant the tomatoes, how you will water the tomatoes, and how much light you will let them get. Water affects the tomatoes by letting them grow. Where you grow the tomatoes affects the tomatoes by how much light they get. Light affects the tomatoes by also letting them grow and become better to eat. :)",2
136495,"I think an important decision would be what to build the structure out of. You could put solar panels on it if you want it cooler in it, or you could put glass on it if you want lots of sun, to make it warmer.",2
136499,"If you think of doing something like keeping the door closed to keep heat from leaving, you are going to kill your plants. There is a certain type of glass for greenhouse that you need. This glass keeps the heat inside. The sun's rays fall onto the greenhouse, and the heat will stay inside of the structure.",3
136489,"Well, I say the structure should have some solar panels so some of the little heat can be turned into solar energy. That would be able to help give the garden some electricity for some of the things used for the garden.",2
136498,Some important decisions are you will need wood and then paint it over with white paint so the greenhouse does not get hot for the tomatoes to absorb the heat and get dried out. You will also need glass for the windows. ,4
136503,Where you put it depending on how much sun reaches the plant.,2
136509,You can make the wall a dark color for more heat and make the roof glass so the sun light can come in.,3
141563,if tons of energy go to the tomatoes they will be rotten,2
136504,You need to have them in a place were they have sun but they can not be in the sun were it is super hot . It needs to be just right .,2
136490,The structure would be a greenhouse it is a solar room and makes the room warm.The effect is the tomatoes will get to warm.  ,2
136516,You should build an inside garden. Solar roofs so a lot of heat would get trapped in and it wouldn't be too hott.,2
136507,"The structure must have solar power and a greenhouse structure. However, the glass must not trap too much heat within the greenhouse, and the solar panels must not cover the glass in any way. Watering and night lighting must also be required for proper growth.",2
136515,You need to know what keep heat inside a building and what can bring in heat not reflect it.,2
136501,"The important decisions are that, for one, you will need a way to trap the heat inside, so when there in not much of the sun out, the are still keeping warm. Also, you will need to make sure there is a way for the sun's rays to get in it, for when the sun is out.",3
136505,"The decisions we will need to make, is where the sun is facing, the average temperature, and not putting it in the shade, becuase it could get even cooler. These decisions affect how warm the plant will be .",2
,,1
136491,You will build solar panels to get electricity and sunlight for my tomatoes.,2
136511,because the heat is absorbing sunlight and making it hotter and then the air particles move faster  and faster helping the plant grow even more faster.,2
136513,Make it a closed area with a black roof . Black will make the area hot or warm and if its closed then the heat wont get out and the cold wont get in .,3
136502,You could build a green house filled with tomatoes.,2
136508,It will effect it because if a lot of energy entes the tomatoes may stay healthy. If a lot of energy leaves the tomatoes may die.,2
136493,,1
,,1
136518,,1
136512,You need to figure out a way the tomatoes get the right amount of light and if they don't they won't grow properly.,2
136506,"Well, a good idea would be to use black objects because it absorbs a lot of the colors and can keep them there for a long time. The black objects will also heat up quicker. So it will be a good decision to make a community garden out of.",3
136497,You will need to fegurout how to to trap the heat inside like glass planes of a green house. ,2
136514,"The important decisions I will need to make in order to let the tomatoes grow is going to be , to build a green house to plant the tomatoes since it is going to be cold outside. Inside the green house there is going to need to be lights and a heater to help the plants grow.",2
136519,Before you plan to plant the structure you will have to make sure its in a sfe tepature place and it needs light to grow.,2
136522,I will need to figure out how to make a greenhouse/solar oven that will trap the heat inside. I will have to use a good material for the insulation and a good material for absorbing sunlight.,3
136496,,1
136517,"You need to put glass that lets heat in but doesn't let it out, good insulation, an a shaped roof to help convection currents go to the plant, and good plant holders. This will maximize heat transferred to the plants.",3
136520,,1
136571,You can make a green house and put all your plants there so they will not be hurt.,2
136550,"You have to build a roof that can reflect the light back in to the garden, so you can have as much light as possible. Also have a room for it so it doesn't get cold.",3
136557,A greenhouse is ideal because the stained glass can keep the heat in. The door is closed so the heat doesn't escape.,4
136566,the structure needs a glass window that only takes some heat and lets most of it out.,2
136558,You should keep them somewhere where there is sun so the grow but you also need to water them.,2
136555,You will need to put solar panels on the roof so the solar panels can keep the rays of light that the suns give off so the plants can grow.,2
136563,the temperature ill effect how the plants in the garden grow.,2
136556,I would use dark colored cloth because it gives off a hot Alfredo and  would need that in the winter since it is cold. I would also use the glass a green house does. These decisions would effect the amount of energy that enters or leaves because energy will be trapped inside it. ,2
136569,"The leaves are basically absorbing sunlight, turning it into 'food'. But you wouldn't want to dehydrate the tomatoes either. The heat and light that enter the structure should be more than what leaves the structure.",2
136574,I think that the important decisions I would make would be what color it will be since the brighter colors absorbs more energy. ,2
136565,,1
136561, ,1
136583,I will make a temperature regulator for the greenhouse and if their i too much heat it will cool the greenhouse and viceversa,2
136551,I would build a greenhouse that was good and reliable too ,2
136549,"Windows will get more light inside the stutterer, and give more heat.
Dark colored walls so more light is absorbed. 
Lights along the garden to help heat up plants.",4
136570,You should put glass in a certain place and you should make the walls out a dark material that doesn't let too much of the heat escape.If you put the glass on the roof then it has a good chance it letting in a lot of light. and if the walls are a dark color then it would absorb the light and heat up the inisde of the structure.,3
136560,You need to make so the heat energy tranfers to the tomatos than gets traped so the tomato can have energy,2
136572,They need to have a spot so the sun can come and then have glass and then the heat will grow the plants,2
136559,Where you plant them can affect the temperature,2
136564,"If we build a greenhouse there would be a lot of heat in the greenhouse.  The suns rays would come in and for the most part, not be able to escape.  If tomatoes are too sensitive it could be too much heat.",3
136567,You need to make solar panels and a green house.,2
136553,I think there should be a lot of sun because when I do see tomatoes growing there in the sun.,2
136546,"I need to figure out what color and material I use for the structure, such as black or white, or metal or wood",3
136580,As i was building my structure for the tomatoes i would put solar panels in the roof of the structure so I could use sun for my energy.,2
136576,the temperature will change if you use different types of equipment to make the temperature rise to a hotter temperature its already at. if you use a certain light bulb it could increase in the temperature.   ,2
136355,"I have to make sure that it is not near a cold area because that will make the temperature even colder. Also I need to find an area that has the most sun light in town because I need as much energy I can get in order for these tomatoes to grow. What I can make though, is a greenhouse since it lets heat get in and and let it go around.",3
136351,When you build the structure you will have to think about the fact the plants need heat and sence its in the winter you will need a reflector for the sun to create heat.,2
139536,"Some decisions may include how large a window should be and how large the structure is. In addition, what material will best isolate heat. The size of the window on the structure will determine how much light, which turns into heat will enter through the structure. How large the structure will be can also affect how much heat will be trapped within itself. The material in which the structure is made up of will determine how much heat will be inside depending on how well the material is as an insulator.",6
139541,Use insulators to retain the heat inside. I think an enclosed environment will protect it from the cold as well.,4
139545,Something that can trap heat that comes from radiation from the sun and we can control how much energy we need by blocking off radiation once our device has enough heat for the tomatoes.,4
139542,I would need to figure out what materials would keep the tomatoes warm in the winter. The structure would also have to absorb as much heat from the Sun as possible and trap it. Temperature also has to be controlled so that it does not overheat and damage the tomatoes. ,2
139540,"We need to build a closed environment for the tomatoes, because the air would impact the temperature, and a close environment would keep the temperature warmer than the outside air.",3
139866,We would need to consider on how to make the garden the right temperature. It should not be too hot or too cold. It will be easier to get the garden too hot.,2
139544,"Materials and structures are very important when making decisions that might impact the temperature because with those materials, it will determine how much heat can be collected or lost. Structure is also important because it allows whatever heat that is trapped to flow over to different areas. The outside of the structure would need to be a dark colors and the inside needs to have reflected materials that trap heat.",5
139864,YOu would probably have to build some sort of insulator the keeps heat in but when the heat leaves it must be slow relative to the amount of heat coming in. ,4
139863,"Some important decisions you need to make are what materials you are using, how large to make the solar home, and how to let in sunlight while maintaining heat inside. These decisions affect the amount of energy, because for example if you have large windows for sunlight to come in is it able to keep all the heat inside or will it just escape back out. ",3
139495,The type of material needed to make the structure is an important factor that might impact the temperature because the type of material depends on whether or not the heat is trapped inside the structure for the plants to grow.,3
139494,"Important decisions that I will need to make that might impact the temperature are where to place the structure and what materials I will use to build the structure. These decisions may affect the amount of energy that enters or leaves the structure by placing the structure in the right place so that the sun will be able to hit it and the structure could absorb the light and turn it into heat for the tomatoes also, using the right materials like glass where it can absorb the radiation and trap the heat and wood or metal so that energy stays or leaves.",5
139492,We need to build the structure at a clearing where there is no tree or any other structure to block the sun. ,3
139824,I need to figure out what materials to use so I won't overheat the environment yet not be too cold to the point where the tomatoes can't grow. Also the location of where I'm going to build the structure so the tomatoes will get enough sunlight and not too much.,3
139482,"The walls of the greenhouse will need to be insulated because a lot of heat loss will occur at night. 
A glass ceiling will be needed to allow sunlight to come in both to heat the house up and allow light to get in. Windows may also be needed to maintain the proper temperature. ",4
139493,"we will need to make sure that sunlight can get in, but the heat bouncing back is unable to bounce back out. This will make sure that the inside of the structure would continuously be heated, and that the plants cant grow.",3
139483,"Where will be planting the tomatoes and how much sunlight is being exposed to the tomato. 
-this will affect if I need to change the size of my structure. 
At what temperature do I need to maintain to keep the tomato from wilting. 
-how can i maintain a stable temperature inside the greenhouse without over heating the plant or keep it too cool. 
How tall/big do tomatoes grow up too on average. 
-this will give me an idea of how big to build my structure. 
What materials are good for insulating and conducting it? 
where should i implement these materials to make sure my structure is not over heating or too cold? ",3
139834,"It needs to allow heat in and be able to trap it in. Insulators are greatly needed. This affects the greenhouse because it keeps the inside of the building warmer than the outside at all times, so the tomatoes are capable of growing.",3
139515,"I will need to decide what material would be best to build the structure out of because this will determine how much heat energy is retained inside the structure. Furthermore, I will need a way to store heat energy in order to use at night because winter nights tend to be extremely cold. The roof needs to be transparent in order to let sunlight reach the tomatoes.",4
139831,"I will need to consider the size of the structure as a smaller structure heats up faster whilst not letting heat out at the ideal rate. I will also need some ventilation, not just for oxygen but to diffuse to extra heat out. I will need to find the ideal amount of material to include in the structure so convection is ideal in terms of heat diffusing to each other and the tomatoes. ",4
139525,We will need to insulate the inside of the greenhouse and make sure that none of the heat escapes.,3
139514,I would use the greenhouse effect by putting glass panels to allow the sun's energy to get through and trapping the heat but some energy will still leave. I might want to use water to help store the heat energy so at night the energy can be used. ,3
139520,"When building the structure for the tomatoes, I might consider building a building with solar panels where heat only goes into the building like a greenhouse and where the heat can't escape, increasing the temperature for the tomatoes. A building with solar panel will increase the amount of energy that enters the structure because heat is being trapped in the building and into the tomatoes.",2
139518,"An important decision that may impact the temperature is how the sun's radiation will enter the area for growing tomatoes.  I will need glass outer layer so that the sun's radiation can enter the greenhouse.  Also, I will need black objects or a black outer layer because black colors absorb more of the sun's radiation than white objects do.",4
139527,The structure needs to be able to allow as much sunlight as possible into it so that the tomatoes are able to grow. Also the structure needs to insulate heat because the tomatoes aren't able to grow in cold temperatures.,3
139506,"Making sure there is glass as the roof, and walls so that it can amplify the heat for the planet to get the energy it needs. This decision allows the glass to easily be heated in which it builds this room temperature of the sun's radiation.",2
139832,"How much light and heat the material allows to penetrate through and how good it insulates the heat. If there is too much heat that enters and remains, the temperature would be too high for the tomatoes to grow. Likewise, if it is too cold because very little is allowed to remain, then the tomatoes would not grow.",3
139833,"You will need to take into factor how big to make the structure and how much of each types of material to use. /if you make a large structure with a large glass roof, then more energy will enter the structure but more energy will leave also. If you use less glass, then less heat will enter the structure. ",4
139505,"Some important decisions that I will need to make that might impact the temperature of the structure for tomatoes are: the structural shape of the building, materials to build the structure, and the location of the structure. The shape of the building must be in a shape where sunlight enters in at an maximum amount, to create most efficiency in heating the structure for tomato growth. Materials that construct the building must be chosen carefully to ensure maximum insulation to keep heat out, but enough conduction to let heat in. The location of the structure must be chosen at a place where sunlight can reach and will remain hitting the structure for a long period of time to maintain a steady hot temperature for the tomatoes.",3
139508,"You will need to keep in mind of the available materials because you are going to have a limited budget as well as space. You will also need to keep in mind of the benefits of a conductor to ensure that the garden will be hot enough for the tomatoes to grow and the insulator part to maintain the heat energy since insulators allow less heat to escape. Radiation is also important because the sun is the essential part of providing heat energy. Conduction and convection are other ways to help with heat transfer between the sun and the tomatoes, as well as the surroundings. ",4
139507,I think one important decision that must be made is where to position the structure. Whether it will be partially shaded or fully exposed to the sun can make a huge difference in the temperature of the inside of the greenhouse. What type of material to build the structure with is also important since the material will need to be able to let energy pass through and reflect. ,3
139836,You have to make sure that no heat leaves the building so that you can have the same temperature throughout the process of growing your tomatoes. Solar panels can help you trap heat and making them stand near a light would help them grow faster.,2
139526,"As you plan to build the structure for the tomatoes you need to consider what materials you are using and the place where you will build it. If you have material that absorbs heat well and is good at insulating then it won't be that easy for the heat to escape. The placement of the structure is also important because if you put it near a tree where there is shade then the structure will not be able to get the maximum amount of energy from the sun, so it is better if you put it in a place that receives direct sunlight throughout the day.",4
139528,We need to build a structure that can sustain an average temperature. You would need glass windows so that light can enter but they need to be tinted so that the light is trapped in. This will allow the light energy to heat up the room.,3
139521,"We can not store too much heat and we can not use electricity. If we store too much heat, it might cook the tomatoes instead of growing them. We need to mimic the green house effect without energy, which we need to use a layer of glass to let the radiation to go into the room and convert to heat, and let some heat out through little holes.",3
139517,You will need to decide how big the structure is because the size impacts the temperature and how much heat is inside the structure.,3
139861,"We would need an enclosed place to keep the heat in, and some insulation like the fluffy things in the wall to prevent the heat from escaping, and a glass roof to allow the sun light to come in.",4
140326,We need to decide what materials will conduct heat so that the specific heat capacity is fulfilled. We need to make something that doesn't allow much heat. ,3
139543,You might consider putting the structure away from taller structures so that it gets as much sunlight as possible. Not only that but you need to include mirrors on top because it lets light in but does not let it escape trapping sunlight inside. ,3
139865,I will need to consider what materials to use to trap in as much sunlight as possible.,3
139538,"You will need glass or materials that absorb light easily because if it absorbs light easier, the energy from the light will help the plants grow. If a material is not compatible with absorbing heat, the tomatoes might die because of insufficient energy.",3
139533,"I would need to keep in mind the amount of sunlight is getting into the structure and how much of that energy will heat up the structure. I would also think about how I would be able to lower the temperature in case the structure becomes too hot. I would also keep in mind how big the structure would have to be because if it's too big, then there might be too much space for heat to distribute through and therefore will make the overall room temperature lower than I need it to be. And on the flip side, if it's too small, then there might not be enough space for the heat to be distributed through and might cause the overall room temperature to be higher than I need it to be. ",4
139539,I will need a material that will take in uv rays but also traps in infrared rays. I will have a garden inside a green house.,2
139537,Some important decisions that I need to make is that I need to know what materials to use that absorbs heat the entire night and day so that the temperature inside the structure will be suitable for the tomatoes. The amount of the energy that enters the structure must be high so that there is more heat that enters the structure and the amount of energy that leaves the structure must be small enough that heat will not escape during the night where the temperatures is very low compared the temperatures during the day.,4
139862,"The building will be made of a material that does not conduct with heat well.
The inner walls will be made out of a material that absorbs heat well.
The roof will be made out of glass that will be able to control the heat that is entering the room.",3
139535,"In order to retain enough heat, you can create a greenhouse for the tomato plant.",2
139534,I will build a structure with a glass roof. This might impact the temperature because glass lets the heat energy go through it and traps it. ,3
139487,Important decisions I would make that may impact the temperature of the growing tomatoes would be not to build it around shaded areas and to get as much sunlight as possible.,3
139826,"I need to find a good place to build the garden, where the sun hits the most and where water is plentiful. I need to be aware of the amount of space. If there is too little sun there will not be enough energy to help the tomatoes grow. The materials are important too.",3
139481,You need certain materials where it would trap heat energy inside the structure. The structure should be a darker color where it would absorb more heat coming from the sun. ,3
139485,You have to decide how much amount of sun light the glass of the greenhouse will take in so that the tomatoes can grow efficiently and how the greenhouse will notice the amount of heat that it absorbs. At the same time the glass of the greenhouse needs to be able to trap and release the heat.,3
139497,You need to figure out what sort of materials are best suited for keeping in heat in order for the tomatoes to have an environment where they can grow properly.,4
139479,"Where the structure will be placed to receive as much energy from the sun as possible and what the structure will be built with.
More energy from sun = greater temperature inside structure",3
139480,"You need to make sure that the infrastructure you build allows some heat to leave while keeping most of the heat inside because you do  not want the tomatoes could go bad. Some decisions to be made surround the questions: What kind of materials should be used?, Where in the garden should the tomatoes be planted?. ",3
139496,"I would need to consider how the tomatoes would absorb heat. It would be wise to pick the warmest spot in the garden to grow tomatoes. Additionally, it is helpful to put a cover over the tomatoes and to water it with warm water instead of cold water. A second method would be using greenhouse pots, which are black recycle containers. The color black would absorb and keep the heat to make the tomato plants happy and warm.",4
139488,"Decide how much windows are going to be used in the green house because this also determines how much heat would be entering and leaving the greenhouse, which affects the temperature.",3
139477,"Important decisions that might impact the temperature would be how large the structure will be, if it is too large then the heat trapped inside wouldn't be warm enough for the tomatoes to grow; what materials the structure will be made out of, some might cause the heat to be released or not hold much heat in, and where the structure will be located, it would need to be in a more open area where sunlight can reach it.",4
139486,The things that will impact the heat of the tomatoes will be the outside source and or the greenhouse effect that will take place. Also if there is to much heat the greenhouse effect will be doubled.,2
139830,"What types of metal to use in order to build the structure, because some metals do not attract heat as much as others do. What environment gets the most sunlight, because tomatoes need a specific amount of sunlight in order to grow and not become overripe. ",2
139501,"We would need an area where sunlight is allowed to come in, this is important because sunlight is a big heat factor and to ensure that our tomatoes are in the right temperature, we would need sunlight to help us out. ",3
139829,"The material being used that will absorb heat in order to be able to get the heat we need like glass or cardboard depending on the material it will heat up in different ways. The size of the structure also matters, if it is too large then it would require a lot energy and take longer for the heat to be the correct temperature for the tomatoes. ",5
139489,"Some important decision I need to make are what the structure should be made out of and how will I be able to trap the heat. I need to take into consideration the material of the structure because if the structure's material does not conduct the sunlight's energy very well then the structure will not be that warm. I also need to make sure to trap the heat because I do want energy leaving the structure, however, I still need to take into consideration that the tomatoes need air. Since the tomatoes need air I need there will be a little amounts of energy escaping.",3
139490,Deciding which materials to use when building this structure is very important. this is because the material determines how well energyg comes in from the outside without it being harmful for the tomatoes. ,3
139491,"The material we use is mostly to be the factor that impact the temperature the most, even though during winter the sun might not shiny as often, but by using the right material that can trap heat efficiently we can keep the green house at the temperature we want with out worrying of it getting too cold or too hot for our tomatoes. ",4
139478,You would need to decide how you can still use the heat of the sun to grow the tomatoes in a closed space to block out cold air but at the same time keeping fresh air inside to grow them.,2
139827,we will need to use foil to make the sun shine on it and reflect directly onto the tomato it will make the sun light that is coming in a little stronger for the tomatoes and make it warmer but not too warm so it should not be directly pointed at an individual tomato ,3
139498,Choose out the right material to build the structure out of. This will greatly affect the amount of energy that enters or leaves the structure because only the right material will be able to prevent heat from leaving the structure. ,4
139499,"When making the structure I need to think of items that can be used that are inexpensive and can produce heat. Some items that come into mind that don't need to much energy is a lighter, tin foil, metal, light bulbs, seeds, and soil.",2
139823,"1) Have insulators to make sure to keep the heat inside the structure.
2) Have glass ""roofs"" to allow heat and light to pass through the structure.",4
139509,"The structure should allow heat to enter the structure but limits the amount of heat escaping the structure, so the structure should be made out of materials that could reflect light.",3
139510,"1) open space - a room an open window that might let heat escape or a garden where its temperature varies throughout the day
2)location - is it inside of a building (like an office) where it remains room temperature or a greenhouse which will be the weather's temperature",2
139513,"You might need to build a greenhouse in order to keep the garden warm. By having windows, Solar Radiation is able to pass through to the garden and become trapped there.",3
139523,"The important decision that i will need to make that might impact the temperature is how to keep the heat inside the structure where the tomatoes are at. Also how to provide sunlight. I would decide to use glass and wood. These decision can cause the amount of heat to enter the or leave the structure due to the way the heat is transfer, and that the material needed to build the structure can help keep in the heat or lose the heat.",3
139524,"The thickness of the glass or material of the structure will be important because it will impact how much energy and heat is able to escape, thus impacting the temperature of the inside. The thicker the glass, the less energy will escape, and more warm the inside will be. The size can also affect how warm the inside could be, as a larger structure will require more energy to maintain a hotter temperature, and. ",5
139519,"The size of the structure affects the heat flow and temperature inside. Smaller size means less sunlight is reflected out, and higher temperature. The color material of the structure also determines how will it will reflect or absorb light. ",4
139522,We will need to make sure that the structure is able to contain heat or not allowing it to escape and to also light sunlight in.,3
139516,I could make a green house the tomatoes so when ever there is sun light I could use that and keep the temperature warm in the house. Keep the place shut at most times so the heat does not leave the area,3
139511,"Some important decisions would be how much space did I need for the tomatoes to grow, how much of the ceiling should I have open to allow sunlight shine through the roof, what material I should use for the walls and ceiling and cover, some type of insulator so the structure does not always feel hot all the time. Not trying to cook the tomatoes yet, just growing them. ",3
139536,"Some decisions may include how large a window should be and how large the structure is. In addition, what material will best isolate heat. The size of the window on the structure will determine how much light, which turns into heat will enter through the structure. How large the structure will be can also affect how much heat will be trapped within itself. The material in which the structure is made up of will determine how much heat will be inside depending on how well the material is as an insulator.",6
139541,"Using insulators will retain the heat inside. I think an enclosed environment will protect it from the cold because it prevents heat from escaping. Using reflectors will reflect radiation onto the leaves, which will increase the temperature.",4
139497,You need to have an insulator and a conductor in order to have the appropriate heat transfer. You also need to make sure that heat stays insulated and doesn't escape so the tomatoes can grow.,4
139487,I would build greenhouses that are wide and short. This will keep more heat energy within the greenhouse to grow the tomatoes better as a wide and short design for the greenhouse will increase the temperature within the house more.,2
139826,The placement of the farm is the most important part as you need to place the tomatoes to grow in sufficient sunlight. You would also need to build perhaps a greenhouse to retain heat due to the cold temperatures. ,3
139493,we have to make sure that we can absorb as much sunlight as we possible can in order for the tomatoes to be able to grow. This will increase the amount of energy entering into the leaves of the tomatoes allowing for more photosynthesis and making them grow more.,2
139513,"Your structure may need to have glass windows on top to allow sunlight to pass through and be absorb by the window. This will cause your structure to become warm and with right materials, can potentially stay warm.",4
139834,Glass on the top so heat comes in but not out. Reflectors that face into the glass so it is directed there. Wooden structure for best material due to its specific heat.,3
139831,"I will need to consider the size of the structure, the amount of material inside the structure, and the size of the opening of the box because all of these variables will affect how hot/cold the temperature will be in the structure. The smaller the structure, the hotter as heat will diffuse faster. The more materials that are inside, the colder as it requires more heat to bring everything inside the structure to thermal equilibrium. The bigger the opening, the more radiation will be allowed to enter, heating the structure up faster. ",5
139516,I would need things to absorb heat in a closed space so the heat won't escape and the place would be warm. Also use glass on the top so the sun light could come in,3
139836,You have to make sure that no heat exits the building so that you can have the same temperature throughout the process of growing your tomatoes. Solar panels can help you trap heat and by making them stand near a light and it would help them grow faster.,3
139545,I need to think about sunlight being directed into the structure and being able to trap heat ton increase temperature for the tomatoes to grow.,3
139538,"I need to keep in mind the materials that are used like good insulators and conductors to keep the heat on the plants. If there is not a good insulator/conductor, the heat will easily escape causing the tomatoes to become cold.",4
139533,I would make sure that I know how much tomatoes I'm growing so that I know the amount of space I should use to ensure maximum heat capacity and minimum heat capacity that will stay within the space that I used. I would also make sure that I have some way to control the temperature in case the space that I use gets too hot or too cold. ,3
140326,We will have to chose the right materials so that it lets in enough heat to make the tomatoes grow and not ruin them. This will limit our decisions on how we construct our shed. ,3
139543,"You would want to build the structure where it gets a lot of sunlight,thus heating and warming the structure. You would also want to put a glass ceiling because it reflects light but also traps heat.",3
139534,"I'm gonna need to build a structure that has an insulator cover on top and materials that absorb light very well inside the structure, preferably on the ground. These are going to increase the amount of heat going in and decrease the amount of heat going out.",4
139861,We need to build it in a sunny place without anything obstructing it from the sunlight. This is important because having access to sunlight is our main source of heat. We will also need a lot of insulation. This is important because we want to keep all the heat in and prevent it from escaping.We also want a glass ceiling because it allows the light to come in and at the same time protecting the inside environment from the cold outside. ,4
139544,The materials and structures gives an impact to the temperature according to how much hear can be collected or lost.  Structure is also important because it allows whatever heat that is trapped to flow over to different areas. The outside of the structure would need to be a dark colors and the inside needs to have reflected materials that trap heat.,4
139864,So I would build a green house that has a good amount of insulation to keep the heat in but mitigate the amount of heat leaving the structure. But not too much insulation otherwise the plants will die.,4
139542,Some important decisions that would impact the temperature of the garden would be the insulation of the structure and the material used to direct heat to warm up the tomatoes. ,3
139479,"Where the greenhouse will be located. This affects the amount of solar radiation that the structure will receive?.
What will be used to cover the greenhouse. This affects the amount of infrared radiation that will be kept inside the greenhouse.",3
139477,"The greenhouse would have to be wider to collect more radiation, glass to trap inferred light inside, and there should be insulators to keep the greenhouse warm as well.",4
139501,,1
139485,,1
139515,We need to have a roof that allows enough sunlight into the structure in order to warm the structure enough. We also need interior insulation in order to keep as much heat in and reduce the amount of heat loss through conduction.Keeping the structure closed will reduce the amount of energy loss through convection,5
139514,The greenhouse must be sealed so no convection from cool air can come in. Glass panels will allow heat radiation to through into the greenhouse. add insulators on the floor to prevent heat loss into the ground.,4
139509,"Building a structure for tomatoes to grow, it is important for the structure to be transparent to allow light energy to enter the structure.",3
139507,We will need to build the structure out of clear material that will allow plenty of sunlight to get through. This is important because the structure depends on the sunlight to warm up the inside and grow the tomatoes. ,3
139510,"Space - allows the amount of possible energy to enter
Container - determines the energy absorbed ",3
139835,"I will make sure that the structure for the tomatoes will have stuff to make it warm inside. It will run on solar energy. I'd use glass, foil, and other materials to make sure it reflects as much light as possible.",3
139517,You need think about the size of the structure because the size affects how much heat is circulated around the structure which changes the average temperature.,4
139521,"In the winter, the weather is too cold, we need to create greenhouse to absorb more heat in the system without electricity. We need a flap with aluminum to reflect radiation to the system and convert to heat energy. We need some insulator like cardboard to prevent or minimized the amount of heat energy from escaping. We need a black surface inside and outside to have a lower specific heat to absorb heat. We need glass or plastic wrap to be transparent to solar radiation, but opaque to the infrared radiation to convert more radiation to heat on the surface inside. With all the absorption of heat, the temperature increase after a delay.",6
139526,Important decisions I will need to make include the placement and design of structure and the materials used. To increase the temperature you need a good conductor that keeps the heat inside. If you place the structure in direct sunlight it will allow maximum amount of solar radiation that hits the structure. ,2
139511,"Some important decisions would be to know what colors and type of material I want the structure to be made out of because if everything is made out of metal, it would get too hot and not so effective with growing everything, so maybe mix things with metal and wood to get it even. Also insulation would be important too. ",3
139506,"We would need to build a solar house so that the tomatoes can grow properly. We would have to use good insulators, to prevent the heat from escaping of the house.",4
139863,Some important decisions that vary your greenhouse is the type of material you use for convection and the size. If you have a tall and skinny structure it will be hard for sunlight to enter however it has a better ratio of maintaining that temperature. For a wide and short box sunlight can enter easily however it wont be as efficient to maintaining the heat against the other box. ,3
139540,"A right environment for tomatoes to grow should be a closed environment, it would protect the tomatoes from the bad weather. Like the greenhouse, the room should have a glass of the greenhouse, that would let the solar radiation get into the room.",3
139866,"The environment of where these tomatoes will grow will effect on how they will grow. Whether how hot or how cold something is, it would need to be recorded.",2
139539,Surround the tomatoes with wood so that heat will be trapped inside as energy for the plants. Use glass to let solar radiation pass through but keep infrared light in.,5
139823,I'll need to keep in mind that I should build a greenhouse in order to trap heat inside especially in preparations for the winter. The Sun therefore would provide enough light and heat for the tomatoes to grow.,2
139535,The materials that are included in the structure of the tomatoes is important because some are necessary to either conduct heat or insulate it. ,4
139862,,1
139537,"In order to build a structure for my tomatoes, I would need a structure that would held the temperature inside of the structure constant even in the absence of sunlight so that the Tomatoes wont get too cold and die of during the night. I would also consider that the structure should let some heat energy come in the structure in the right amount so that the Tomatoes wont get too cold or too hot.",3
139832,"You need to consider how much heat to trap in so the decision is what material to use to do this. Depending on the material, the heat could be trapped in well or could also not be trapped in as well.",4
139523,The important decisions that will impact the temperature will be the type of material use to make there structure and where to build it. These decision can either increase or decrease how much energy can go into the structure because if the structure is build with materials like metal then a lot of the energy would be able to escape the structure or like if if it is build in a shady place then the structure would not be able to gain lots of energy.,4
139833,"As I build a structure, I will need to make sure to have enough places where sunlight comes in, and also find a way to contain the heat. Putting too much glass panels up can allow a lot of energy in but also a lot of energy out. Yet putting only a small amount will not allow enough energy to come in. ",4
139519,"The structure will be short in height but wide in width so that it can maximize the surface area that lets in sunlight. There will be reflective flaps along its side to direct the sunlight into the structure. The inside of the structure will be black so it can absorb the sunlight that passes through its opening. Then there will be glass the cover its opening so that the heat from the sunlight can be trapped inside, which overtime increases its temperature inside.",5
139505,"A greenhouse-like structure must be built; a glass covering must be used to allow solar radiation from entering the structure to heat it up, it also prevents infrared radiation from escaping the structure. A insulating inner lining will also help heat up the structure because it captures more radiation. An insulating wall will also help heat from escaping from the structure to the surroundings.",5
139483,"I need to keep in mind how to harness all the radiation that the structure can contain and utilize the materials to keep the heat insulated INSIDE the structure and not just the outside. Because depending on what my material is and what color, it contributes to how much heat/radiation it will absorb and if it will stay warm, or will the heat leave. ",5
139496,"I would need to consider how the tomatoes would absorb heat. It would be wise to pick the warmest spot in the garden to grow tomatoes. Additionally, it is helpful to put a cover over the tomatoes and to water it with warm water instead of cold water. A second method would be using greenhouse pots, which are black recycle containers. The color black would absorb and keep the heat to make the tomato plants happy and warm. ",4
139489,Important decisions I will need to make are the materials and how I am going to ventilate the structure. These decision will affect the amount of energy that enters or leaves the structure because I need materials that will allow radiation in but also trap it. I will also need materials like wood or an insulator that can keep the heat in and not let it out into the surroundings. Ventilation is also important because it will help move heat throughout my structure.,4
139494,"Important decisions that I will need to make that might impact the temperature are where to place the structure and what materials I will use to build the structure. These decisions may affect the amount of energy that enters or leaves the structure by placing the structure in the right place so that the sun will be able to hit it and the structure could absorb the light and turn it into heat for the tomatoes also, using the right materials like glass where it can absorb the radiation and trap the heat and wood or metal so that energy stays or leaves.",5
139518,"An important decision that needs to be considered is the size of the greenhouse because some sizes can retain heat better than other sizes.  Also, you will need material that can allow the sun's energy to enter through but cannot leave.",4
139525,"We will need to be able to trap heat in by using things like dirt, windows and air.",2
139520,"First, you need a area for the tomatoes to grow in and make sure the tomatoes are contained in that area and sealed. Also have a glass roof so heat can be contained. Without electricity, you can use some sort of reflector to reflect light energy into the area for the tomatoes to stay warm. With a reflector, tomatoes can get heat to stay warm in the winter.",4
139527,A design that's most efficient at receiving sunlight for the plants is beneficial to success. A poor design leaves room for error.,2
139508,"I would use glass as a roof for a greenhouse to store the tomatoes so that radiation from the sun can go through and the glass can prevent some of it from leaving. This will increase the temperature because infrared radiation changes into heat energy, which will help raise the temperature of the greenhouse. I would also use wood to build a greenhouse so that the space inside can act as an insulator and keep the temperature warm.",5
139524,The material of the structure determines how much heat is absorbed and reflected. The size also determines how much heat energy the tomatoes will receive. A larger greenhouse would mean the more energy is required to heat up the box. ,5
139528,,1
139522,We will need to add materials that will help trap heat. ,4
139824,"Where the structure is built because if it's built near a shady spot, then the tomato plants won't get enough sunlight, whereas if the structure is built at a sunny spot, it might rot the tomatoes. Also have to consider what materials so the material can either absorb or reflect the sunlight.",3
139482,There needs to be enough windows to provides the tomatoes enough sunlight for photosynthesis. The house needs to be an enclosed space so that to tomatoes will have enough heat,3
139480,"The material the greenhouse will be made up of, the location and the size of the greenhouse will all impact the effectiveness of the structure. The material will make sure that heat comes in and stays in, the size will make sure that heat is moved in the most efficient way. The location will give us the maximum amount of heat. ",5
139828,The inner structure should be a dark color so the tomatoes absorb as much heat. Dark colors reflect more heat as well so the outer part of the structure must be a light color. You should also take into account of the materials so you can use materials that insulate well such as styrofoam.,4
139492,The greenhouse should be located at a clearing where there is no tree or tall building in the surrounding so that more sunlight can enter the greenhouse.,3
139829,Placing the tomatoes where there is enough sunlight for them to grow which is really important. Building a greenhouse will help retain heat because of the cold temperature outside. ,2

139827,,1
139800,"Some important decisions that you will need to make are where you will plant the tomatoes in order for them to receive enough sunlight and if there is anything that will cover the sunlight like buildings or bigger plants.This will affect the amount of energy that enters the structure because it will determine the amount of heat that will be retained for the tomatoes to grow, theyll need to build a greenhouse that will keep the temperature warm.",3
139488,"Important decisions would be how much glass would be in the greenhouse, which would control how much heat would enter and be retained in the greenhouse.",3
139495,Some important decisions include having the right materials like glass and wood and having the right size for the structure. These decisions may affect the amount of energy that enters or leaves the structure by determining how much energy the structure can hold and what the specific heat capacity of the materials will keep the structure from losing energy.,3
139785,The important decisions that I will need to make is decide what should the materials be made of and how should I design the structure since these decisions may affect how effective the heat is stored in the structure.,3
139769,What kind of materials can conduct and hold heat well in the structure because that can affect how much sunlight or heat the tomatoes get.,4

139840,you have to find a way to absorb the heat and find it if you're not growing it in the sun.,2
139875,You would need to find a way to absorb more heat and energy since it is more colder than the temperature that tomatoes usually grow in so you have to find a way to absorb and trap the heat.,2
139806,"i will build a glass house with no windows. Glass is a good insulator, sunlight can pass through the glass, and glass can also trap the heat inside of the house.
