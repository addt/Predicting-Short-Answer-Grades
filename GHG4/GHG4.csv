118296,"I think they are simalar because, the solar ovens will let in heat but not let out heat.

Katie",4
118300,"Well were going to be using cardboard instead of glass.
They are cardboard boxes.",2
118302,A is similar because the glass looks like the solar panals.,2
118310,i think that the solar oven will match our project because we are trying to make inside the solar oven hot in there.,2
118304,The heat from the sun gets trapped in the oven and can't escape. it warms up the food. The earth is like the tin foil.,3
118313,The solar oven will absorb sunlight and the solar panel will keep it in there. Also the shiny side of the solar panel will attract sunlight to come in.,3
118319,both examples trap heat and do not let it out so anything inside will heat up.,4
118297,because both are letting sun in and reflecting sun at the same time,2
118298,"First, is the sun represents heat and the solar oven represents heat as well. Second they both are just similar.",2
118311,first the oven collects heat from the sun to get solar power.second the sun hits the solar pannel and gives it power,2
118305,the house is made out of card  board band the solar oven is affecting what is inside. ,2
118293,A is similar because the glass acts like the tin foil in the solar oven. B is similar because the atmosphere acts like the tin foil in the solar oven.,3
118299,"1 reason,Sun reflects to glass so it hits more sun.2 reason,Earth circluates around the sun so the sun pretty much hits every single planet inculding of course the earth so it would hit the earth. ",2
118309,"solar ovens trap heat,and they get lots of heat",2
118307,They both act in the same way and both would function like a solar oven.,3
118306,the sun makes the green house warmer than the air outside ,2
118308,WE are making a solar oven and the pictures are related to a green house ,2
118321,Yes because picture A  has the glass on the roof and looks kind of looks the project,2
118312,"Yes,picture A is similar because that is how our solar oven will look like.Also,the sun will heat the the inside like the greenhouse.",3
118318,on both pictures a and b they are both the same because the sun is going through earth and the house.,3
118303,They both do the same thing as a solar oven does. Also they both effect the sources of earth's heat.,2
118314,yes becoue thay are both doing the the same thing ,2
118301,I think it's like picture A because it shines through and giving the plants sunlight.Another reason is it's has more sunlight by the sun and it's the same with the solar oven.,3
118316,picture (a) is similar because the greenhouse attracts heat just like the solar ovens. ,2
118320,"Yes, both of them are similar because picture A is giving one thing sunlight so it can grow.Picture B is similar because it is giving the earth sunlight and heat.",4
118294,0,1
118315,because the sun light will reflect onto the food and it will not close it will just use the sunlight it already has,3
118323,"Yes, both are very similar because the solar oven atracts alot of heat just like the glass and the earth they all keep the heat inside.                                                  

SOLAR = SOL = SUN",3
118482,0,1
118478,The solar power from the sun refects off the solar oven.,2
118479,"1.they are both in the same galxey
2.they deal with sun and plants


",2
118480,its similar because the suns rays are inside the box so it can cook the food. its also because it attracks the sun. And it gets its power from the sun.,3
118473,i imagen the solar oven can cook and its going to be good how to observait how it builds up into a solar oven,2
118474,hskbytsnzgkuvkcjrwqetk-9f0e[pol,1
118483,0,1
118470,Picture B isn't similar because the ovens are not going to be able to reflect back outside.,2
118472,0,1
118468,"They are both similar because in the solar oven, the heat bounces back to the food or whatever you are putting inside of the oven so it cooks whatever is in it. Also it makes it so the heat goes to the food and the box parts goes to reflect the light/heat so it is alike.",3
118475,It reflects heat like the solar oven and contains the heat.,3
118477,The reason why I chose A was because first of all the reason why the sun is hitting it is because of the mirrors on the top. Last because it is also see thru windows so the sun could instantly hit it.,2
118465,Neither are designed to get really hot.,2
118487,we are letting energy come in but we are not letting out and we are covering it with something,3
118488,?,1
118486,I said picture a because the heat has to inside the oven and it can't escape or else it won't heat up.Also the heat can't escape from the oven/,3
118484,0,1
118485,0,1
118490,because it is nothing like the solar oven because it grows the plant what we are doing is experementing if the foils and the other objects we have,2
118467,A. Its similar because its gonna aim to whatever u put in it.,2
118471,The solar panels use the suns rays to generate power and the panels get heat into the oven and that heats up what is in the oven.,3
118469,0,1
118466,"the sun is giving light to the plants and making them live
",3
118543,there not similar because the heat is not going down in picture a but in b it is. another reason is picture b is affecting the earth and picture a is only affecting the greenhose,2
118515,0,1
118517,"First picture A is like what will happen and picture B is like A so they both show what will happen I think.
",2
118533,"because they both show the gasses and heath getting trapped ,And they both show heat reflecting",3
118518,The first reason is because the way a solar oven cooks the food is by heat. The second reason is becaause the box needs to trap the air like a green house and the atmosphere. ,2
118548,Both are similar because the sun can reflect on the glass in the greenhouse to make it hot and also with the solar ovens so that we can cook the food. Also we will be using the sun to cook the food in the solar ovens and for the greenhouse they also used the sun for the plants.,2
118522,they do the same thing and reflect light tours a sertain way,3
118562,the roof the heat waves and the plants,2
118526,I know this because the earth is the heat to are solar oven.,2
118567,"picture b is similar to the oven because the sun goes in the atmosphere to heat the earth, but it can't get out one more reason is because the atmosphere is like the glass in the solar oven.",3
118516,Neither are simaller because it reprisents glass not tin ,2
118521,0,1
118520,1.Because it goes through the glass 2.it goes through the atmosphere,2
118514,"In picture a and b heat is coming into the greenhouse.Also the heat is reaching the surface, and staying in the picture. Finally, the heat is either heating the plants or the surface of the earth.",2
118512,In picture a the sunlight goes in and stays and in the solar oven the oven takes in the heat and uses it. Both things also have something in side getting affected by the sunlight.,3
118509,The sun reflects in and out of the oven and the solar oven has glass on it.,2
118534,"none are simillar because they are diffrent meanings
",2
118519,"yes they are similar because both of then are shinning hard.And both of them have vibrashion
",2
118511,because they dont look simaler.,2
118542,Yes they are both similar because the solar energy helps the plants grow in the green house and the solar oven cooked the food with solar energy.,4
118537,I said neither of them because we haven't done it.,2
118529,One reason is that we could use something like the glass panels so it could allow heat in the oven. Another reason is that we could use the glass panels to keep the heat inside.,3
118536,the glass or plastic will trap the sunlight and the tinfoil will reflect the sunlight into the item in the solar oven.,3
118523,"because there both heating up,qlso the atmosphere is like the galss pannel th e sun heat passes through

",2
118530,"1.yes because the greenhouse is like an oven for the plants
2.yes because the sun gives light to the plants that are inside of the greenhouse but if it's a lot of sun a a little more better",3
118510,The heat goes and stays in the greenhouse like how the heat stays in the green house after it goes in.,3
118513,because itll attract sun and keep heat in.,3
118556,I think the reason is that because the glass brings the heat and the other one is the outer layer keeps in the heat.,2
118549,i think that pictures are similar because my teacher side that the soler over will run on the power of the sun just like the green house the plants grow and the helps so they are both similar because they represent the same thing  ,2
118607,the solar oven will let light pass through but not let heat pass out. the solar oven will absorb as much heat as possible.,4
118622,0,1
118604,"the glass is the  green house and the pic ture B is almost the same thing but much biger
",2
118614,the b picture is similar because it is the earth which is solar,2
118628,"I don't know what a solar oven is, but just the name makes it sound like the pictures with the glass.",2
118632,0,1
118602,"
??????????????",1
118600,They both heat the ground or floor.,2
118623,"Yes it is simalar to A because both are releasing gas,and both are having something to do with heat.",2
118613,one shows earyh the other shows a house one shows the sun beam through and the other reflects one shows the sun the other doesnt show the sun in the piucture ,2
118610,"well,the sun's heat will come to earth and heat it up, but then the heat get used and obsorbed.",2
118618,One reason is that the heat/light will bounce off of the shiny reflectors. Another reason is that most greenhouses are humid and hot. The solar oven also reflects the light which creates heat to heat up the food.,3
118626,0,1
118621,0,1
118611,0,1
118606,"the light heats the house.
the house is good for the inviourment",3
118620,because were trapping it. were keeping it in.,3
118616,0,1
118601,They both have the same affect as a solar oven.The green house uses the same method as the atmosphere.,3
118615,Because it is similar to picture A. Picture A shows a house with heat energy.,2
118624,0,1
118634,0,1
118609,icant,1
118612,the solar oven reflexts the sun to the object inside the box not into space,2
118947,0,1
118344,"because the heat is traped inside of the green house

Also it gets to a hot temp to cook some thing to eat like breakfast, lunch or dinner        ",3
118337,0,1
118358,"1.They both trap solar energy
and
2.They both are used the same way kinda.",3
118350,One reason is the reflective material in the box attract the sunlight and then just bounces around because the reflective material just keeps the heat moving around the box. Another reason is that the food is like the Earth it absorbs some of the sunlight's energy.,3
118353,Because the picture is coming in and reflecking out.,2
118346,Because when the wall observe the heat they will make the greenhouse warm.,2
118366,The solar oven reacts like the glass of the green house or the atmosphere,2
118352,The greenhouse is like our solar ovens because it keeps the heat in while keeping other things out.,3
118355,First it lets it in then lets it stay in warming and heating the food/cooking item inside. It also lets heat escape but very slowly witch keeps the food hot but not too hot,2
118338,"The sun heats up the glass like a solar oven to cook. Also, the solar oven cooks food and the glass puts heat on the plants to grow.",2
118348,They are both because it reflects.,2
118349,first they both need sun second they both need heat,2
118354,because the green house has the solar oven like it but the B picture the sun jumps of the earth.,2
118351,The picture of A is almost like twins the both absorb sun light.,3
118361,0,1
118345,They are similar because they are radiating heat so then that space heats up.,2
118341,"A solar oven works by trapping heat inside the cooker, heating the food. It works like a greenhouse. ",3
118367,because they both have glass,2
118343,"I think they're both the same because heat passes through the windows just like how heat passes through the solar ovens. Another reason why i picked that answer, is because the atmosphere acts like the solar panels in the solar oven and the greenhouse windows are the same thing, it acts like the panels in the solar oven.",2
118357,because the soler ufin is ceping the heat in and cooking the food.,2
118369,The solar panels attract the sun like the picture and the solar ovens.,2
118339,"B is similar because the sun provides heat for the oven, and the oven can let air out sometimes.",2
118372,it is alike beacouse the green house lets heat in.,2
118360,it holds heat into it just like the solar oven.,3
118356,"Well the glass acts like a trap to heat, the heat can get in but cant escape. The heat will stay in the glass house to help the plants",3
118347,Because they can work the same way.,2
118371,1. the sunlight does jot go anywere,3
118368,they are the same,2
118364,because the heat goes in but it keep reflecting and heating up the box and the box keeps the heat inside,3
118362,"In both pictures, some energy needs to stay inside",3
118397,I think B first because in Picture B we would be outside on Earth while the sun would be shining down on our solar oven. I also think B because in picture a we wouldn't be in a greenhouse testing our solar ovens.,2
118393,0,1
118417,because i explaned that earth would get the choice since the solor enger would get at the green house,2
118403,yes because they both save energy and light .,3
118410,yes becas it is right,2
118392,they are not similar because the solar oven lets the heat out ,2
118394,The A picture is like a solar oven because glass let the sun come in and in the solar oven the sunlight reflects on the food which cooks it.,3
118413,Reason one is that we are using the sun to heat the oven and we are using both of the same glass for the experiment.,2
118408,"because the sun bonses off the roof
",2
118409,because it is simalar to the green house,2
118401,They both act like a oven they keep the energy from getting out. They use the energy to warm up the earth and plants and an oven for warming up food.,4
118405,"one is because the sun passes there the glass so the the plantes get the sun and they can grow 
one more is that the sun is has to hit the glass before getting to the plants so the sun has to hit the solar before getting to whats getting heated ",2
118402,1. It is absorbing the heat 2.It keeps the heat energy from ecscaping ,4
118406,"They are both similar to solar oven because, they both do act like a giant window the makes the heat more powerful.",2
118400,i think they are both similar because in one picture there is reflection and in the other one there is heat coming out.,2
118415,Picture A is similar to a solar oven because it preserves heat and also reflects light.,3
118398,only part A because it shows how it is like a soleronven and the other resone is that it keeps the house clen,2
118395,A is because allowing the heat to go to it. Also it is making the heat hotter and reflecting of the glass.,2
118412,because the house is like the food and the sun is heating it up,2
118391,The green house and earth's atmosphere are both trapping the heat energy from the sun just like a solar oven does. The solar oven traps heat energy from the sun to heat things up and/or cook things like a green house and the earth's atmosphere.,2
118411,The light gets bounced off just like figure b.,2
118407,Picture A is like the Picture B and both a similar to the solar oven.,2
118414,"The could air would be gone.
The heat will stay in the box.
The box has to be filed with heat.",2
118418,"If one is the same, the other has to be the same. Every thing is the same except the solar oven is smaller.",2
118416,0,1
118396,i said the sun because sometimes the help plant grow and the reason is that the sun make plant grow like fruit and other,2
118419,A good reson is that they do not have any thig coments,2
118404,0,1
118439,Both are similar because it lets light in and traps it.,4
118437,In b the sun reflects like a solar oven.In picture a the sun does not reflect.,2
118438,I think A is similar because it will stay in the shelter for a while but the heat will be released eventually,2
118443,"Picture A is similar to my solar oven because the heat from the sun is reflecting off of the glass and heating up the building, the sun is going to reflect off of something and heat up the ""oven"".",2
118456,Picture 5 because the sunlight doesn't get out but it bounces around.,3
118455,the plastic and tinfoil in the oven act like glass to magnify heat to use it too cook food.,2
118446,"The pictures are both similar to my solar oven because they both reflect sunlight onto something to heat it up, or in my case, bake it. They also all use only solar energy to complete the task being shown in their pictures.",3
118440,"1.it is similar because it is solar and uses the sun
2.the box is using the sun to make the plants grow",2
118451,the sun bonce off the reflted surface warming up the black surface.,2
118462,i don't know yet because we haven't made the ovens,1
118442,because the heat is bouncing off of earth and it is heating earth.,2
118447,"1. picture a is similar because the glass is absorbing the reflection and realising(<-sp?) heat on the inside thus creating a greenhouse effect.
2.picture b is not similar because its not collecting the sun's heat in one spot.",2
118441,In picture A the light is bouncing off the glass like in the solar oven. In picture B the same thing is happening.,3
118452,"One of my reasons are that the glass is heating up the room in the green house, my second reason is that it looks like a box too
                    ",2
118461,It is no because solar ovens have heat reflected from the sun and it goes to the (for example) hotdog.  With the greenhouse the warmth from the sun comes inside but doesn't get out of the house.,2
118460,Yes because the picture is the same thing but just using earth. Another one is that tehy are both collecting sun.,2
118464,yes because if  it was b then it would just go back,2
118453,We all know there is heat on earth well it seems like there is some heat in the green house too. Another answer is that There is heat in both green house and the earth.,2
118458,The light is bouncing off the walls and going in the plants[picture A]. The light is bouncing off of the atmospher's wall and the earth and some of the light is traveling into the earth[picture B]. The light going into the eart and plants is like the heat going into whatever you are cooking in the solar oven.,3
118454,"I don't really know how solar ovens work, so I took a guess...",1
118457,yes both are similar because they look the same ,2
118445,"I chose that both are similar because the glass traps the heat, making the inside hot. Also, the glass magnifies the heat inside, like the glass in the solar oven.",3
118450,"I think both because maybe the solar oven absorbs heat also like the green house, using shiny reflections to capture the heat.",2
118459,picture a is simalar by the green keeps the atmasphere inside like a solar oven.,2
118463,because the solar oven has reflective sides so the suns heat will hit the object,2
118448,They are both alike because the metal will absorb the heat and the shiny part will reflect the heat back in just like the atmosphere keeps heat in. This is also like the greenhouse in the way that the walls keep heat in.,3
118444,"they are similar because they hold in the suns rays, just like the solar oven does, only smaller. It cant be one or the other, because they both hold in the suns rays.",3
118476,0,1
118481,it shows that sun is shining on the plants through the glass onto the plants like how a soler oven works,2
118535,"yes,both are similar to the solar oven because they both attract heat just like the solar oven will. Also, they both are used for making something turn into something else. a seed into a plant, a raw hot dog into a cooked hot dog. ",2
118540,I haven't experimented the solar oven yet.,2
118544,the heat goes into the comartment and heats it,2
118527,I guessed,1
118557,One reason both pictures are similar is the both reflect heat. Another reason they are both similar is that they both use heat to help you.,2
118528,picture b is just to open and different from the oven picture a is smaller more like the oven,2
118531,0,1
118524, Picture A and B are similar to the solar oven we're creating because they both collect solar energy to heat or to keep warm.,3
118545,the light is heating the solar oven. And the light is getting heated by the green house gasses,3
118558,0,1
118561,"They are not similar because the oven reflects heat inside and outside the oven.
They are not similar because the oven is supposed to cook while greenhouses and earths atmosphere are supposed to keep heat.",3
118525,both because they both collect sun.they both reflect sun,2
118539,the light gets trapped in the oven,3
118554,the plastic is absorbing and the insidious is reflicting,2
118566,The sun is pointing the direction of the green house and is making heat inside of it.,2
118565,Its because it acts as if it were a solar oven and has the same reaction as if it were also a solar oven.,2
118550,"It uses the sunlight to ""heat"" the plants. It uses solar powered energy",3
118551,0,1
118547,i think because the window get really warm so you can cook something ,2
118560,because the sun is involed,2
118568,prqueenuna entrael calor y enlaotra no,2
118553,they are not simaler because they do not have anything in commen. they don't  have the same things.,2
118546,                                            ,1
118538,For question A the energy wont be able to escape. For question B the energy is going but some of the energy is ascapeing,2
118552,i don't know,1
118563,We did not do the solar oven yet.,2
118555,they are both simaler because both of them are like each other,2
118569,"I think that because the pictures both look like the sun is projecting on it,and because it also looks like the picture from the solar oven.",2
118571,it is similar because they are both using energy from the sun and they are both using heat,3
118559,i dont know j,1
118564,Both are the same because they show the rays and the heat.,2
118570,0,1
118585,no it is not because#1it doesn't match the sentence#2it does not have the same meaning &#3 is that I . ,2
118590,   the cold air stays in and the heat goes out.,2
118575,"First,the unique glass keeps the sunlight flowing through the box or green house.
Second,the sun and the atmosphere keeps in all the gasses and keeps sunlight flowing in and out of the earth constantly.
Third,a solar oven has the suns rays hitting what ever your cooking on the solar oven.",3
118594,"1 because the glass is in the roof and the heat come in 
2 it has the same effects 
",2
118586,"because you want the heat to be in the box
",2
118595,well how picture a looks like thats how my oven kinda work the heat work the way the picture looks like.,2
118578,the sun in Picture A is supposed to warm up the green house just like the solar oven. The goal on both is to warm up the oven or in this case the green house just using the sun.,2
118593,"First, on picture B it reflects the heat just like the solar oven. 
Secondly, in picture A its heats the greenhouse just like it will heat the solar oven.",2
118582,because it heats the inside,2
118587,i picked that anwser because the sun is reflection off the box,2
118588,Yes.,1
118589,0,1
118579,The reason neither are similar is because both show sun going in and gas coming out. Solar ovens reflect the sun's energy and turn it into heat.,3
118603,cause it like the solar oven with the heat coming in and out. ,2
118592,My first reason is that is that both pictuers are  simalar to the solar oven because the green house kept the hot and the atmosphere  lets the hot air in . Seacond reason is that the hot from the atmosphere will let the hot air in and it goes to the solar oven .,2
118584,I think they are both are similar because they are holding something from the sun just like the solar oven will. They are also similar because it is heating something up.,2
118576,"First, it is simalar because the sun is reflecting off it and heating something.
Second, it is simalar because the sun is heating the green house and putting sunlight on the plants.",3
118599,Because it looks like a box and there is heat inside.,2
118577,"1 because solar ovens work the same way
2 because as the solar oven the greenhouse reflects light too",2
118591,yes they are because the glass in the greenhouse is reflecting from the sun an ,2
118580,one reason is the  suns solar energy is going in then going out.my second reason is it looks like the one from the video.                                                                   ,3
118598,Picture A is similar because it's reflecting the sunlight back inside much like the solar oven.,3
118581,Picture a looks similar because its absorbing heat and like warming up the plants like a solar oven would do.,2
118619,no because they are not ovens. no because they don't like ovens,2
118608,The a picture looks like similar to a solar oven because there is heat and the plants look like they have heat and the squiggly lines look like it.,2
118597,I think it is picture B because it also is observing light ,3
118630,0,1
118583,because the solar oven holds in the heat*and the amplifises the heat,3
118637,because the sun is heating both of them.And they provied enrgy,3
119017,Reason one is that we get heated up but the sun. Reason 2 is that we have ovens.,2
118296,"We used plexiglas to trap in heat.
It trapped in heat.",3
118300,"Yes because the greenhouse is reflecting the heat from the greenhouse garden and my solar oven reflects with tinfoil to.

We put dark construction paper at the bottom that heats up the food.",2
118302,0,1
118310,"The first reason is that my solar is like the green house because heat enters, it bounces in there to keep it warm,and it makes it warm in there and makes the things inside hot to meat or grow.",3
118304,They all trap heat inside and they all are powered by SR.,5
118313,They both absorb sunlight so they get hotter. They also both trap sunlight so it stays where it is.,4
118319,our box traps heat like the atmosphere or the greenhouse.,3
118297,They bot are absorbing heat and they are both heating something up with heat.,2
118298,Well A/B acts like our solar oven because they both absorb the heat. And then when they're done absorbing the heat they both reflect the heat back out.,3
118311,Because the heat is hiting whatever is inside and there is glass like the plexi glass in our solar oven project.,2
118305,it would heat it up,2
118293,"They are both similar to the solar oven because the glass, the atmosphere, and the plexi glass let light and heat in but not out. Also, the green house earth and solar oven are the same because they all heat up the intirior of them. Finally, they are all the same because they all work in the same way because they all use solar energy to heat up and they all slighty reflect and keep heat energy trapped inside.",5
118299,My first reason is that well on a solar oven its needs heat and that's solar radiation and the picture on A has solar radiation.My second reason is that on picture A it has green house and if you think about picture A and a solar oven i would think that the green house is the solar oven.,3
118309,because is a green house that absorbs heat.,2
118307,One my solar oven has some material to keep my heat in (plexi-glass). Two it has reflectors (tin foil).,3
118306,all 3 of the objects bring in heat and let go of cold air,2
118308,they are both using the sun and they are both using heat to help the plants grow,2
118321,Yes because both of them are absorbing solar radiation and you can see the solar radiation bouncing of both of the pictures,3
118312,Picture B is similar to my solar oven because the solar radiation gets absorb and some gets reflective and the solar oven does the same too.,3
118318,#N/A,1
118303,picture b  because it is simular to our solar oven,2
118314,0,1
118301,I think that they that picture A looks similar because it it looks like a solar oven except it is in a house form and because your trying to attract the sun. ,2
118316,it is similar because it is kind of like a box,2
118320,There both similar because the sun is shining in both of the pictures.,2
118294,The heat gets trapped inside the greenhouse just like with the solar oven.,3
118315,one is that our solar oven has plexi glass which acts like a green house second our box keeps heat in the box like how the atmosphere keeps the earth warm,3
118323,picture (a) is really similar to our solar oven because it has the glass to keep the heat inside just like the greenhouse. ,3
118482,None of them are cause mine just goes up.And cause mine has something on the  top.,2
118478,The heat is collecting in the green house and it's heat up the inside and all the plants.,2
118479,"1.The heat affects the oven
2.It bounces off the oven
3.The heat goes into the atmosphere",2
118480,I think this one is the one thats mostly similar because it traps the heat just like the box.,2
118473,because the heat obsorbes and it will be hot inside?,2
118474,im in a rush so im guesing b,1
118483,The two reasons are because the Sun shines on our box and gets reflected by our aluminum flap and into our box.  The second reason is we have something that absorbs heat.,2
118470,Picture A is more similar to our solar oven because when the heat goes into the box the heat is supposed to stay trapped inside and not reflect back up.,3
118472,0,1
118468,"They are both similar because they both have the same uses, but different actual objects/things. The glass in the greenhouse, the atmosphere, and the plastic wrap in the solar oven all have the same uses. Also a few other things that right now I can't remember what, have the same uses too.",3
118475,They both get some light reflected and some absorbed like the oven.,3
118477,None of them are similar because both of our solar ovens are shaped as a box and it is not a planet or a greenhouse .,2
118465,"The solar oven's plastic wrap let solar radiation in. Also, it trapped the solar radiation in. It worked like the glass/ atmosphere. ",4
118487,we had plastic rap and that trapped the air to,2
118488,0,1
118486,Picture A because it absorbs the heat like the oven and it traps the heat and energy as the green house.,4
118484,It reflex like ours and it provides heat for our food...,2
118485,i think that picture A is similar is because the light heats the greenhouse and the oven up.,3
118490,"because the greenhouse is the box. the food are the plants, and the ",2
118467,picture b is similar to my solar oven because the plexi glass keeps in the heat and will burn the food.,3
118471,Our solar oven keeps in heat and it absorbs Solar Radiation.,4
118469,In A the heat goes in. In A the heat doesn't come out.,3
118466,"In my solar oven the heat stayed inside the oven.  Also heat was able to get in,but not escape.",3
118543,I think neatheir because the green houses heat is obsorving and picture b some heat is reflecting. Another one is they are comparing the greenhouses and the earth.,2
118515,they are both a little bit the same because picture A shows that the heat stays inside. On the second picture it looks like some of it is reflecting off too. So it is a little bit of both.,3
118517,thay are just doing the same thing basically.,2
118533,picture B is most similar because the green house is like a solar oven box.,2
118518,They are like ovens because they trap the heat in and make the space heat up like and oven.,3
118548,Yes they are both similar because because heat is geting obsorbed. Also they are all reflecting the energy.,3
118522,its like the greenhouse because it keeps heat in. it also reflects heat,3
118562,k,1
118526,It is similar because the sun hits the earth.1.it is just like it because some of the heat goes in to the box.2.most of the heat did not go in to the box.,2
118567,"One reason is because once the heat got in our solar oven, it was trapped inside there. Another reason is because the heat was be able to warm up the thermometer, like the sun warms up the earth.",3
118516,I think this because i dont really have a reflecter.,2
118521,the atmosphere acts like our plexiglass.,3
118520,#N/A,1
118514,"First of all, in both pictures a and b some sunlight is passing through the atmosphere or glass as it would pass through the Plexiglas on our solar oven. Also, some of the sunlight is bouncing off the earths surface or the plants and some is getting absorbed like on the black paper of our solar oven",4
118512,"A is similar because the heat only goes in and not out like the first picture. Also, the green house and my solar oven both are using heat to provide it for the objects inside.",3
118509,Some air gets absorbed. Some air gets reflected.,2
118534,because you have to have things like plastic rap tin foil,2
118519,Because the solar oven attracks the sun but the picture B doesen't. And picture a does.,2
118511,"Because the heat in are second one wont get as must heat.
",2
118542,Picture a is similar because the solar energy was trapped in the box and didn't get out of the box and reflect somewhere else. In picture b the solar energy is being reflected somewhere else.,3
118537,"First, it is similar because the picture shows the sun absorbing into the object. Second of all, because it shows that after it absorbs the heat it reflects off the object,in this case it is reflecting off the  food inside the box.",2
118529,Yes picture B is similar to my solar oven. The first reason is my solar oven obsorbed some heat but it also reflected heat. My second reason is that the atmosphere acts like the outside of the box it doesn't let heat get out.,3
118536,"1, in A the greenhouse is shaped like a box and the earth isn't. 2, the solar oven is made out of man made materials like the greenhouse and unlike the earth.",2
118523,0,1
118530,"1.because the sun (light) goes into the panels (box)
2.the greenhouse (box) absorbed the light that goes into it.",3
118510,Both pictures are very similar. They are both also similar to solar ovens because they heat up when solar radiation enters and turns into heat.,4
118513,"It keeps heat inside, and heat bounces off the walls like picture A.",3
118556,It is similar because the plastic rap keeps the heat in the box and it is similar because the tin foil reflects the heat.,2
118549,"1 reason is because the lid the lid traps the sunlight.
reason 2 is that we used black paper to absorb the the sunlight so just like the plants they both absorb sunlight",3
118607,the two pictures show that the place will heat up like our oven. both the things let solar radiation in but did not let it in like our solar oven did.,3
118622,Yes they are both similar because they attract heat.,2
118604,our solar oven had glass to prevent the  heat from escaping,3
118614,one reason is they both absorb heat.Another is that they are both hand made.,2
118628,"First, they both absorb, and collect the Solar Radiation and turn it into Heat. Secondly, they both Reflect some of the Solar Radiation. ",4
118632,1.Because it absorves heat just the solar oven 2.My solar oven has plastic wrap as the roof 3.There is shiny reflections in the green house,2
118602,"i said A is similar because the green house is like a box and the green house is traping the heat into the ""box""",3
118600,We put plastic wrap on the top to keep the heat inside.,2
118623,The heat is going to earth like the heat is going into the box. The earth is also giving off heat and the box gives of some heat. ,2
118613,are solar oven absorbs some heat and reflects some also,2
118610,the light gets trapped in the solar oven heating the oven. and the light bounces around and off our reflective sheet.,4
118618,Picture A is similar because our solar oven lets in heat ,2
118626,"         My solar oven is like picture A because it lets heat in and not out,also it reflects the sun,and it got 80.4 c.",3
118621,because we added glass and it was similar to part b because it reflected off,2
118611,#N/A,1
118606,they are because when the heat hits the plastic wrap it traps the heat in to keep the oven warm and the heat reflects the from the foil and heats the food. ,3
118620,it traps the heat in and it gets hotter,3
118616,The solar oven keeps the suns energy from escaping to heat up the temperature. The solar oven reflects the sun.,4
118601,One reason they are the same because they use reflectors. They are also they same because the reflector let heat come in and escape.,2
118615,"Picture A cause, we put plastic wrapper on top of the solar oven to heat up the oven to reflect. And when you put a food inside the solar oven, then the food will be heated.",2
118624,1.I chose that answer because Picture B is showing light being reflected.2.The plastic wrap on my solar oven helped reflect the light that was given. ,3
118634,#N/A,1
118609,#N/A,1
118612,the oven is like the earth and the greenhouse because it lets the heat in but not out untill a while,3
118947,Both try to keep the energy to pass through it then keep it.,4
118344,1. it is similar to my solar oven because it keeps heat in but still gose out,3
118337,  ,1
118358,because the sun is reflecting off and because we did not use greenhouse gases and finally we did not need a greenhouse.,2
118350,"There are both alike because one, the greenhouse and the earth greenhouse affect are mostly the same thing and two, our plastic wrap acts as the greenhouse roof and earth's atmosphere.",3
118353,Because the reflection is like the foil. Also the black paper holds in the heat.,2
118346,"because the green house in a close space, and glass is like a plastic warp.",2
118366,Both are like a solar oven because the solar oven is based on both of the designs shown,2
118352,The reason both are similar to the solar oven we created is that the solar oven like the pictures a and b reflect light but absorbs light as well.,3
118355,It shows that the heat in a is going in the same and out slowly just like ours. The desingn is very simiar to our oven because it stays in and only goes out if it is to hot.,3
118338,"One reason is that ""A"" only has it going through the glass. Another reason is that ""B"" has heat only reflecting off.",2
118348,yes both because some heat obsorbeds and reflects.,2
118349,a is simaler cause it does the same thing as a solar oven and it show you how it work and also how a solar oven works to,2
118354,because my solar oven the heat comes in and the solar oven comes in .but B it bounce off the the earth,2
118351,The glass absorbs the heat just like the plastic wrap absorbs the heat. And cold air goes out. Also there is something easy to heat up.,2
118361,"It is  similar because I think picture A and B are similar because in are solar oven the box was really hot so in like picture a it did not let the heat go  it so i think are solar oven did it to but picture B  shows that the heat goes out so I think ares goes out to.




 the heat goes out so i think are to. 





",3
118345,because ours lets it in but doesn't let it out.,2
118341,All three have a surface screen that traps the SR and IR inside. As well as a ever rising temperature.,5
118367,because they look diffrent from each other.,2
118343,"Well, A and B are the same as my solar oven because heat passes through the atmosphere, but it also goes out. And heat can also be reflective because we had tin foil to reflect the sun.",2
118357,because the fist reason is thet they bothe obsorb the heat and light and let it in.,3
118369,#N/A,1
118339,"This picture relates to our solar oven because first, we have a plastic wrap that acts like the atmosphere and second, the heat waves go through our oven the same way.",2
118372,picture a is like the oven beacouse it has a roof and it keeps the heat inside.,3
118360,picture a is getting cold air out an hot air in so it is like our solar oven.and part b getts warm air in and cold air out like our solar oven.  ,2
118356,both of these are nor simular,2
118347,It is the same because we used plexiglass and the heat stayed inside but did not go outside.,3
118371,". it reflects sun light
. it has solar radiation
. it gets hot. ",3
118368,"heat can reflect through plastic wrap,the same way it goes through glass.",2
118364,because like the A greenhouse the glass keeps the heat from escaping. also B is like my solar oven because it also lets heat in but doesn't let it out.,3
118362,#N/A,1
118397,Our solar oven had plexiglass on top and it looked just like it.,2
118393,  I said both are similar to my solar oven because we had plastic over my solar oven and plastic acts like the same to glass. Another reason why I think my solar oven was the same because it still absoured heat.,2
118417,0,1
118403,It is similar to my solar oven because it didn't let the heat out and because they both attract the sun light.,4
118410,It is similer because it is.,2
118392,#N/A,1
118394,A is like my oven because the plexi glass is like the glass panel.The sunlight goes to the plants and cooks my food.The glass panel lets sun come through and in my box the sun cooks the food.,3
118413,"the first reason is that the heat stays inside of my solar oven and the second reason is that sunlight goes into the plants and with the solar oven the heat stays in the cardboRd
",4
118408,because it is the same thing as the soler oven. because it gets hoter and hoter,2
118409,they are not the same thing at all  because the green house has no grass so it need the sun,2
118401,well since the box is a contained space its like  the green house and since the plastic wrapkeeps the heat in it acts as the atomosphere and the glass panels.,4
118405,i think its like mty solar oven because the hot air stays inside and is bing odsever by the plants same with our solar oven the heat heats the food .it is also the same because the sun heat the glass same with our solar oven,3
118402,Both because there both keeping the sun in and keeps the light on one thing also because it reflects,3
118406,"B is similar, because, one, the heat comes as solar energy, some bounce out and some stay in. Second, b is similar, because the atmosphere acts like a big piece of glass or other material.",4
118400,two reasons both pictures are like my solar oven is because the sun is reflecting of of some thing and because something absorbs energy in both of the pictures.,3
118415,One reason is that both my oven an picture A have glass to let the Solar Radiation pass through. Another reason is that they both are shaped like prisms.,3
118398,because the pic i had that in mind and it shows the same think,2
118395,Yes they are similar because the plastic wrap acts like the atmosphere and the heat goes in and doesn't come out. Only a little bit of heat come out. Also the heat from the black paper also collects heat and just like the plants and the earth.,4
118412,because the atmophere reflects the sun light and it also collects it,3
118391,"It captures solar energy and turns it into heat energy and releases infrared radiation. It also relies on the sun to do things. Without the sun there, it can't capture solar energy and turn it into heat energy.",4
118411,"We have no trapper covering the top of the box. We have reflective tin foil in the sides of the box.
",2
118407,"We had plastic wrap covering the front of the box, so that acts like a reflecter. Also the black paper at the bottom of our box attrected the heat like Earth.",2
118414,"They both take in heat.
Both trap heat.",3
118418,The greenhouse effect is in the solar oven I made.,3
118416,I think this because they both keep the heat in.,3
118396,0,1
118419,Yes it works like a greenhouse because shine to the sun.,2
118404,i said that A because the heat go in ,2
118439,A because it keeps heat in,3
118437,"the solar raidation goes through and stays in.
in the pictures the raidiation comes ourt",3
118438,Both pictures our almost the same. Our solar oven absorbs heat but keeps it for a bit longer because we placed plastic wrap over our oven.,3
118443,"The plastic wrap on the lid of our solar oven acts like the glass and Earth's surface, the plastic wrap reflects the solar radiation inside of the box, like the atmosphere on Earth",4
118456,"It's similar like picture a because the solar oven also kept the heat inside and also it's like picture a because just like the solar oven, the sun's heat shoots through.",2
118455,we used plastic wrap on top of the lid of the box.,2
118446,Picture B isn't similar to our oven because the picture shows sunlight bouncing or reflecting off the earth and we had no reflective items to reflect sunlight. Like the green house sunlight comes in and is absorbed immediately.,3
118440,"The sun comes from atmosphere
the atmosphere is where the heat is

",2
118451,Because the the plastic wrap is like the glass.Also we have refeckte suface,2
118462,well our oven keep all the heat in like picture A.  it also obsorbed the light from the sun like in Picture A. ,4
118442,"because light and heat can get in easily but cant get out as easily

because heat builds up faster than it can escape",4
118447,"1. picture a is similar because it is keeping the Heat in completly.
2. picture b is not like our solar oven because some sun rays can be reflected out.",4
118441,"They are both the same because in picture A it shows the heat passing through the glass and in the solar oven there was plastic wrap on the top and the heat went through that. Picture B is similar because it shows some heat being absorbed and some heat being reflected. In the solar oven some of the heat got absorbed by the dark colored construction paper, while the tin foil reflected the heat inside the box to heat it up.",3
118452,because it is absorbing the sun and it is brown like our box,2
118461,They are similar because the inside of the atmosphere/glass stays warm from the sun but the heat doesn't get out.  They are also similar because they both have sun heating them up.,3
118460,Well the plastic wrap acts like the glass and the tin foil  acts as the acttrackter so i say both since they are the same thing just different items.,2
118464,"1.at atmosphere because it bounses off 
2.the inside is like the inside of the box.",2
118453,because in the green house the light goes all the way in.,3
118458,The solar radiation is transfering into the green house like the sun comes into the box. The heat is staying in the green house like the heat usually stays into the solar oven.  ,4
118454,"1. A greenhouse is a giant glass box that keeps heat from escaping once it gets inside because apparently plants like heat because, logic. Sound familiar?
2. This is just an excuse for the directions for this questionnaire. All my reasons are in reason 1 above.",3
118457,A is similar because the glass will make the heat go through it so it can get hot ,3
118445,"My solar oven's plastic wrap act like the atmosphere, trapping infrared radiation. Also, The infrared radiation inside the box increases the temperature in the box.",4
118450,I think the both are similar because the solar radiation shines through the solar oven. The brightness reflects off the foil creating more heat. The black paper around the sides of the solar oven help absorb more heat.,3
118459,The both are similar because the both donÂ´t let the heat escape. And it from the earth radation.,4
118463,because the black paper kept the heat in side the oven.the plastic raping acted like a atmosphere and contain the heat from escaping ,4
118448,They both are similar because they both absorb heat and keep heat in just like the black paper and plastic wrap.,3
118444,"They both have atmosphere and glass (just like plastic wrap) and they both keep some of the heat in, but let some of it out.",4
118476,Yes because our solar oven reflected like the greenhouse.And it reflects back to the sun.,2
118481,it is just representing it in two different ways,2
118535,"I think picture ""A"" is similar to the ovens because in picture ""B"" it shows that the heat is bouncing OFF of the earth and in the greenhouse it just shows that the heat is ENTERING the house. Our didnt have heat bouncing off of it we had our oven soaking up all the heat instead. ",2
118540,"It's similar to picture B because 1 the glass and the atmosphere is like the plastic wrap covering our oven, 2 the sunlight comes into our oven and turns into inferred heat.  ",5
118544,yes because the heat goes through the surface and hits whats inside it just like the solar oven.,2
118527,because it has something that looks like plexie glass,2
118557,Picture A and picture B are both similar to my solar oven because my solar oven also reflects heat and absorbs heat just like the glass and the earth.,2
118528,"yes they both keep heat trapped
",3
118531,"1. I don't think my solar oven was the same because we had a reflector kind of leaning over our oven
2. I don't think my solar oven was the same because a lot of black construction sheet that was our heat collector. ",2
118524, Both A and B are similar to my solar oven because they both are absorbing heat.,2
118545,The heat is heating up that house and it gets hotter inside so it is warm. The other picture shows the heat going in the earth. And it shows the heat bouncing off the earth.,2
118558,They are similar because our solar oven observed heat and also reflected light to heat up our food.,3
118561,It is similar because it traps heat inside to heat the inside up.Our paper absorbs the heat causing it to heat up even more. ,3
118525,picture a is similar because 1. all of the solar energy went in and stayed in 2.the solar energy came from everywere.,4
118539,it allows light and traps the heat and lets the cool air out,4
118554,the sran wrap is like the atmosphere and the windoe and the foil is like the surface of the earth,3
118566,Picture a is similar because the glass lets the energy in and we used plastic wrap on the top to let in the enery and the roof has 2 tilted pieces and we tilted the top of the oven.,4
118565,They both are similar to a solar oven,2
118550,It has an aluminum foil flap. it's a box.,2
118551,"My first reason of why picture A was similar to the solar oven was because the glass reflects the heat and it also lets in some heat. The second reason is that the glass allows the heat to help the plants, sort of like how the plastic rap allowed the heat get in and melt our food.",2
118547,because they both get on the glass and it is hitting something ,2
118560,the sun goes thotht the glass,2
118568,si porque son ,2
118553,their not the same because they do not have any thing in commen.,2
118546,"Both are similar because one, both let heat energy in but not out like the plastic wrap on my solar oven. Two, all do that to keep the thing inside warm. Earth keeps us warm, the greenhouse keep the plants warm, and my solar oven cooks my food!",4
118538,The heat is being absorbed but it is not getting out.The green house is trying to keep energy from coming out.,3
118552,"it was hot enoufe,and it is good splize.",2
118563,"In my solar oven,once the heat goes in it can't come out because I put plastic covering on the top and foil inside.",3
118555,Picture b is simaler because that is how the solar oven works ,2
118569,part A is similar because the sun is radiating on the plants.,3
118571,"They are similar because both of them collect solar radiation and both turn it into heat energy.
",4
118559,0,1
118564,1 Because the glass is just like tinfoil. 2 Because the rays come from the top.,3
118570,0,1
118585,both are similar because the heat enters the solar oven and gets trapped. ,3
118590,there was no covering so the suns rays could go in and out and our cold air could go out.,3
118575,"The glass holds some and lets some go

The atmosphere lets some go and absorbs some also",2
118594,No neither are  similar because ours is like an L and we used tinfoil,2
118586,0,1
118595,0,1
118578,They are both similar. Reason 1; The cover of the solar oven is absorbing the heat just like picture A and B. Reason 2; The inside walls of the solar oven have the heat bouncing off each wall trying to help cook the food and in picture A the sun is trying to heat the room. IN picture B the sun is trying to heat the earth.,2
118593,"First it is similar because its lets in the heat.
Secondly it only lets out a little bit of heat and keeps most of the heat inside. ",3
118582,because our was not similar to A or B,2
118587,yes A and B are the same because they react the same way as the solar oven.,3
118588,"Because the oven is not supposed to give off anything else it's supposed to keep heat in.
",3
118589,"Well if both pictures are similar to eachother than both of them are similar to the solar oven.
Second,
the heat from the sun passes through the plastic wrap of the oven as it would be for the glass panels on the greenhouse and the atmosphere of the earth and the plastic wrap also keeps the  heat inside like the panels and the atmoshere would do and the heat cooks the food in the oven.",4
118579,because our oven lets heat in then traps it.,3
118603,Cause they look like it,2
118592,One reason it that the when that the heat from the sun comes in like the sun goes in the atmosphere and the green house. The second reason is that it is aborbing the suns heat just like atmosphere and the green house. ,2
118584,0,1
118576,Part b is similar because the sun is reflecting and going into the Earth. Also the sun is heating the Earth like the sun is heating the solar ovens.,2
118599,A because when I wrap my solar oven with plastic it reflect.Another thing is when I wrapped my solar oven it looked like a greenhouse because it reflect and the sun came in.,2
118577,#N/A,1
118591,because the heat went inside our box and it got trapped in there.,3
118580,yes because the sun is going in and out.the other reason is giving energy.,3
118598,Both are similar because the glass and atmosphere kept the heat in like my solar oven. It also absorbed heat like the two pictures.,3
118581,"B is similar because heat energy reflects in both, they absorb heat,and the heat makes what it is absorbed by hot.",2
118619,They both get radation and send off infered.,3
118608,"fist of all, like the green house the heat  is stayed in so it could cook the food. Second they are both hot when heated. The greenhouse takes in the heat and so does the solar oven it takes heat to cook the food.",2
118597,they are both similar because they both are getting heated like the solar oven and they are both observing sun light.,3
118630,Is not similar because the radiation shows different.,3
118583,because the plastic rap is the atmoshere and when the solar radiation and heat go into the box it takes two or three trys to escape .,4
118637,0,1
119017,"1, they both are doing the same thing but in a different diagram. 2, for solar ovens, heat goes in, heats what is inside, then goes out, like in the diagrams.",2
136389,"One reason I think that picture A and B are similar to a solar oven is because they both keep energy in. The box, the atmosphere and the glass panels keep the energy in. The energy comes from the sun. The earth, the food, and the plants are heated. For these reasons, I know that what is happening in these pictures are similar to a solar oven",5
136362,I think it is yes because it is like convection current. The hotness goes out and rises up in both the pictures.,2
136368,It is in a trapped space like the heat will be for the solar oven. Also the suns heat is helping the greenhouse work like for the oven.,2
136372,Picture B is similar because in the picture the heat bounces off the Earth like a solar oven. It is also similar because the sun heats up the Earth like a solar oven.,2
136352,They are both like a solar oven because they both keep in heat and gasses.,3
136382,"One, the two models both get heat to be trapped inside of them. And two, They stop all the heat from escaping it making the inside hotter.",4
136374,"1. There is both light being reflected
2. There also is 
light being absorbed.",4
136356,"They are both related to the solar oven because one, they both are exactly the same so that would help with the solar oven, and two we could use the method of trapping the heat inside the oven to heat up what ever's inside of it.",4
136370,"I think a is similar because by the picture it looks like something is coming in , like maybe heat or something.",2
136354,Its is similar because the moister give water to the plants and the atmosphere is not giving us to much light.,2
136367,they both reflect of of the sun rays and be reflected by being heated up by the sun.,4
136388,"In a solar oven, the heat waves are ""bouncing"" off the walls just like the heat in the  atmosphere and the green house making the room, Earth, or oven hot.",2
136683,be case they have humedoty there hot and all three of them het something up,2
136369,My first reason is because it traps the suns heat just like a solar oven would. My second reason is after the suns rays are trapped they are used in away for the plants. ,2
136378,They both come in and gets reflected so it can't escape like how the solar oven will hold the heat then to                cook whatever that is inside the solar oven.,4
136359,The both are similar because the you need sun to heat the oven and the sun from the greenhouse and from the atmosphere are both coming down on the plants and on the Earth.,3
136390,I think that none of them are similar because the glass in the green house is reflecting the suns solar power and so is the suns earth in picture B.,2
136375,Because the solar oven will get heat put into it and then have the heat traped inside ,3
136384,A solar oven insulates heat like both of the pictures. A solar oven also absorbs heat like the pictures above. ,3
136387,When you build a solar oven you want it to get warm inside like the greenhouse.  You also want the heat to stay in the oven just like the atmosphere does for the earth.,3
136366,"I said A yes, picture a is similar because 1 the glass shows it and 2. it's ''cooking'' the plants.",2
136363,Picture A is like a solar oven because the glass panels are keeping the heat inside the room and Picture B is like a solar oven because the atmosphere is keeping the heat down to Earth.,4
136373,Yes it is similar as a oven because the sun is coming inside the thing and making it warmer once it hits and stays there forever.,2
136360,Because its atracting light and using it to heat things u ;D,2
136364,They both reflect the suns rays and it will be reflected being heated up by the sun.,4
136380,They both are like a solar oven because the glass from the greenhouse and the Troposphere are keeping the warmth/ heat in so it makes in hotter. An oven keeps the heat in it while something is cooking inside to actually cook it. They don't look like an oven but they act like one to keep us and those plant warm/hot. ,4
136391,I think its because of the heat and because of the type.,2
136379, First reason is that they both take in light. My second reason is that a has a glass panel and b has something similar to that ,4
136377,i said a is similar to an oven because wen you are baking the heat from the oven stays in side and gets hotter the longer it is there,3
136381,"They both are similar to a solar oven because one, picture A and B are the same, so that makes both similar to a solar oven. Two, is that with a solar oven you will need to put it outside because it is a SOLAR oven. Then the sun's waves go into the oven, and the heat stays inside. Three, and that is exactly what happened with the greenhouse, and Earth!",5
136361,Picture a is like a solar oven because the heat is going through the windows and it can't escape so it gets hot in there. There is also the windows that acts like plastic rap so the heat dose not escape.,3
136685,They are both because it shows how the energy goes through thing and does something with it.,4
136419,1.They both are because a solar oven uses solar energy to heat things so do greenhouses and the earth's atmosphere. 2. ,4
136415,"because in the picture it looks like the way an oven will work if you think about it.That and i have been in a lot of greenhouses and they are burning hot inside, even more if its hot outside.",2
136395,"In picture A, the house is absorbing and using heat. Also in picture A, the house is containing heat in an area.",3
136393,"The solar oven will let in the heat, but will trap the energy. It will bounce around heating the food. The oven acts the same way the atmosphere and greenhouse glass does. ",5
136408,"In picture A, it looks like the sun is being absorbed and is heating up the green house. In the description, it says, ""Picture ÄúAÄù shows a real greenhouse where light form the sun passes through the glass panels and heats the inside.  The glass panels of the greenhouse keep the heat energy from escaping.""",4
136421,"It is similar because, the glass on the solar oven keeps the energy inside.",4
136404,"I think picture A is similar to a solar oven because a oven needs heat to heat up, and the solar energy (heat) is passing through the greenhouse, heating the place up.",3
136420,A is similar because the heat is being bounced back at the plants. B is simular because the atmosphere is bouncing the heat back at the earth.,3
136414,"I said yes to picture A because it is bringing the light in and when you cook something, you want the light coming in. ",3
136392,"Picture A is the most similar because it shows heat getting absorbed in and trapped in there like an oven. For example, an oven needs to get heated up so it absorbs the energy it gets from sun radiation, then it gets trapped in there to heat something up.",4
136397,Both are similar because they both save energy and bothy make sure that it dose not escape.,5
136424,it is like a solar oven because it is a confined space that keeps the heat in. it also uses heat from the sun to heat it,2
136423,"The solar oven sucks in the energy from the sun, the glass in the green house does the same thing.",2
136403,"Both are similar, because in a solar oven the sun reflects, and that is what both pictures are doing. Picture A the sun is reflecting off of the plants, and picture B shows the sun reflecting off of the Earth.",3
136412,"they are both similar,because they are both reflecting light back into space.",4
136407,Heat goes in and energy from the sun is used.,3
136411,BECAUSE IT IS A SQUARE. IT TRAPS HEAT. KEEPS HEAT.,3
136402,The glass is like solar and conducts heat and go's on to the plants such as an oven would when cooking food.,2
136400,"Both pictures shoe that they attract heat, and they both have radients.",2
136406,"1.The solar oven reflect the sun beams like the green house


2.Same with the earth.",2
136405,I think this because both A and B models take in the heat and keep it there. Also in the oven it takes heat from the sun and traps it so it can cook the food inside. ,2
136416,becuase they both trap in heat,4
136409,The solar oven traps heat inside like the atmosphere.  The glass or plastic on a solar oven is like the glass on a greenhouse.,4
136398,"First off, picture B and A are similar to a solar oven because the Sun's rays keep bouncing up and down, like how you cook something in a solar oven. Another reason they are all alike is because they all collect the sun's rays and energy and they don't let it escape.",5
136418,In Picture B it looked more like a Solar Oven just by the way it looked and how the sun was bouncing off the Earth ,2
136399,the green house glass is giving the plants all they need to grow ,2
136417,I think picture a is similar because it has to deal with reflection.,2
136425,"Picture A is similar because it's trapping the energy and using it. In a solar oven, it is heating whatever is in it and in the greenhouse it is heating the plants to make it grow.",4
136394,"Yes, both are similar because it shows how light affects Earth, and how light is going back into outer space. ",3
136422,In picture A it looks like the heat of the sun is coming in and reflecting out of the house.,2
136410,because a solar oven gathers heat from he out side and traps it inside to make it hot. And in a green house the glass panels gather heat from the outside and trap it inside. Same way Earths atmosphere traps heat from the sun.,2
136396,Because the solar panel attracts heat the other picture does not ,2
136426,Cause they both attract rays like the solar oven. ,2
136413,"A and B are similar themselves,they both deal with gasses, and reflect energy and heat.",4
136453,"Since they are both reflecting the light back at the Earth, they are similar. ",4
136451,Picture a alsoreflects solar energy,3
136462,So the green house trapps the heat in the house like a oven heating food up. Just like that when you open the oven door the heat leaves to oven. Just like the green house. ,3
136481,"I choose this because I think that the plastic wrap of a solar oven is like the atmosphere and the glass of a greenhouse, trapping heat.",4
136460,One reason is that they are both trapping heat like a regular solar oven and even a regular oven. Another reason is they both reflect things off one another like an oven does giving a thing heat or in this case nutrients for the plants in the greenhouse.  ,3
136457,"1.) Once the sunlight shines through the glass panels/atmosphere (depending on scenario), the heat gets trapped within them. Warming up or keeping warm what ever is inside.",4
136459,The both look like they are contracting towards something.,2
136476,I chose A because the green room keeps the heat in the room. Also the other reason is that picture B is reflecting the suns raise. ,3
136456,"For one it traps the heat, and also is good at absorbing it.",3
136483,I chose yes picture A is similar because the solar panels are something you can use for a solar oven. Another reason is because it reflects the power beams away so the solar panel can do that but shine the power beams on the food instead of reflecting them in or out.,2
136463,"They are both similar because they attract the heat, and trap it. ",2
136450,"The heat is going in and can't find a way to escape.
It is warming up in the green house",3
136482,,1
136467,A solar oven is taking heat and trapping it inside of something.In the models you are taking heat and trapping it.,3
136454,"1.It shows that the glass keeps the heat from leaving and in a solar oven you also want that to happen.
2.The picture shows that there are white walls and they reflect light.",4
136465,Yes because it is collecting heat. Then the heat is stuck in the earth. ,3
136477,yes both are like the solar oven because they are both reflecting off something.,3
136468,"Yes they both look similar because 1. the earth's atmosphere is like the glass of the green house.
2. the sun reflects from the atmosphere and the sun reflects of the green house glass
",3
136461,I think a because the oven absorbs light just like the green house does and uses it to power things,3
136475,"Yes, picture B is similar because the earth is like the little house and the arrows are just like the plants.
",2
141559,well 1: like the ovens it lets out and takes heat so i think both are simalar. and 2: just like the diogram the bigger oven (earth) takes in more heat then the skinney one ( green house ),3
136485,,1
136452,"They are both heating up, and they are both using solar energy.",4
136471,"neather because the green house is letting heat in. 
and b isleting heat stay",2
136474,"A solar oven bounces heat off of reflective surfaces, like glass or aluminum foil.",2
141560,,1
136469,I think A is similar because the green hose keeps the heat in and I think a solar oven does to and besause they are both letting the sun shine into it.,4
141561,It looks like a solar oven because it has the top of the oven is the glass and the inside looks like a inside of an oven.,2
136480,Picture A is going into the Greenhouse. And picture B is reflecting out of the greenhouse.,2
136464,My reason it that a solar oven covers the thing it is cooking and applies heat and solar rays. And the two pictures show that the Green house and the Atmosphere is covering the earth and giving it solar rays at well. And that is my reasoning.,4
136455,"Yes,both pictures are quite similar because...
1.) The arrows represent the reflection sunlight bouncing off of Earth like the squiggly lines on picture 1
2.) The red squiggly lines in the greenhouse look like the arrows that are having the sun bouncing (reflecting) off of the Earth, sending it array to the Earth's Atmosphere.",4
136492,I think picture A is the like a solar oven because it's hitting the plants also picture B because the solar radiation is hitting the earth and is heating it up.,3
136500,"Two reasons are that one it says that the sun goes through the glass and heats the inside. My second reason is that the glass panels of the greenhouse is keeping in the heat, which is exactly what a oven does. ",3
136494,"The greenhouse is similar to a solar oven because the heat stays in the oven and doesn't go out. Also because, the heat is keeping something inside or on the greenhouse warm-like a solar oven does.",3
136495,They are like solar ovens because they absorb heat. They also hold things in heat up the things inside of them.,3
136499,"Picture A simalar to a solar oven because it shows the sun giving off heat, and the greenhouse glass is keeping it in. If it were a solar oven the heat that stays in would be starting to cook whatever is inside.",3
136489,"My two reasons are that both pictures show the area absorbing heat, but it is reflecting a bit of the heat so it doesn't become too hot.",3
136498,"The greenhouse is simalar to a solar oven because the green house is trapping the heat for the flowers to grow, like if you were baking something, you need the heat for the food to cook. ",3
136503,These are similar because they both trap heat and they both get hot.,3
136509,I don know realy because I have never see a solar oven and what it does.,2
141563,it is the same because the sun is going to the plants and the sun was going to the oven,2
136504,I think it is like a solar oven because in 5th grade we did a solar oven and we had a piece of glass with the aluminum foil and we left it in the sun and we got to eat our smores .,2
136490,"Yes because the greenhouse is the atmosphere and the outside is space and where the sun is, and picture b is of the atmosphere and so is a. THe arrows are also the same. ",2
136516,The oven doesn't let heat escape but when it does it's not too much.,3
136507,"Picture A is similar to a solar oven because the greenhouse reflects light and traps heat in the same way that a solar oven would. Picture B is similar to a solar oven because the atmosphere acts as the greenhouse glass when letting light through, but trapping heat inside.",4
136515,Picture A is similar because it keeps the heat inside and makes it warm just like a solar oven.,3
136501,"I think that because, in a solar oven,the heat from the sun would be ""allowed"" into the oven, and it would get trapped inside, to the item inside of the oven would get constant heat.",2
136505,"Picture a is, because, for one thing, the suns rays are going down into the greenhouse, just like the suns rays would go down on the solar oven, and two, once the suns rays go into the greenhouse, the heat from the sun is trapped in the greenhouse, just like the heat gets trapped in the solar oven.",2
,,1
136491,A solar oven absorbs heat and reflects it just like the pictures.,2
136511,because they are both taking in the heat.,3
136513,"1. maybe the solar oven takes in heat and reflects it .
2. Also it shows how heat goes places and can get reflected right back.",2
136502,1.Heat gets traped n the green house which is heating up things.,3
136508,The first reason is that in picture A the greenhouse looks like an oven and that the sun is coming in to it it's absorbing. Secondly the earth gets effected by whatis happining.,2
136493,,1
,,1
136518,,1
136512,They are both similar because a solar oven keeps the heat energy in just like the pictures show.,5
136506,"Well, in a solar oven it traps in heat from the sun like a greenhouse.",2
136497,Im guessing because ovens trap heat inside of the ovean to cook. So like a green house it is traping the heat and the other one is the same.,4
136514,Picture B is similar to the solar oven because like a regular oven there needs to be stored heat in the oven so something could be cooked and it is the same thing with the solar oven the heat from the sun comes toward the solar oven getting trapped inside the oven so that something should be cooked on the solar oven just like a real oven exceot a real oven is used with electricity.,2
136519,They are sort of the same because they both get sun light and both reflect it. They also reflect it and they both give heat back.,4
136522,I think picture A is like a solar oven because a solar oven absorbs sunlight and traps the heat inside.,4
136496,k,1
136517,"This is because they both let heat in, trap it and let it bake the stuff inside. It also has empty space with things inside, and they absorb and reflect lots of heat.",4
136520,,1
136571,One the sun makes ight and heats things up and two the green house is making it warm inside also giving the plants light so the can stay warm.,3
136550,"It looks like the sun waves are trapped a little like the oven would, it is also projecting on certain areas like a solar oven.",4
136557,"The picture b is more like trapping heat, but not enough to cook. The greenhouse is small and trap more heat.",3
136566,the reason why is because they are doing the same thing and they are not letting any heat out,3
136558,Because the solar oven needs sun to cook. And because the oven needs the suns heat to cook.,2
136555,The green house panels bring in the heat and it traps it so it can heat up the room. ,3
136563,You would use a green house effect to keep the heat in ant to help raise the temperature faster.,3
136556,"I chose A because like a solar over, the sun is shining down on the items within it. ",2
136569,Both are similar to a solar oven because the heat is building up.,2
136574,One reason is that both of them can keep the energy and also because both can let the energy pass.,3
136565,,1
136561,The glass keeps the heat inside and the heat is used for power to help the plant grow and the oven used the heat for power too.,2
136583,"1. they trap heat and make it warmer in their ""container.""",3
136551,a solar oven traps the sun so it can bake it  ,2
136549,"The light is absorbs into the green house, earth, and the oven, the it heats up, the release light. ",4
136570,A solar oven is similar to picture A because the solar oven lets the heat and light in and keeps it from escaping. Since picture B is similar to picture A then picture B is also similar to a solar oven.,5
136560,Bcasues it comes in to the oven and it traps like in the oven,3
136572,Both of them becasue there both traping the heat,4
136559,1) it traps heat inside 2)i have no idea what a solar oven actually does,2
136564,"I think neither are similar to the solar oven because I think the solar oven is an oven, that is powered by the sun.",2
136567,"It heats the oven, and keeps the stuff hot.",2
136553,"yes because it shows the light reflecting.
yes because it is using solar energy (radiation) 
 ",3
136546,"The oven heats up things inside, just like the atmosphere or greenhouse",2
136580,"1. picture A is similar to a solar oven because they both need silver stuff at the top of them
2. they both need the sun for energy",2
136576,they are both similar because sun comes in and is trapped. and when the sun comes in it transfers threw layers and is trapped in.,4
136355,"I say yes because they both are light that can't escape, so is a solar oven.",4
136351,The sun has direct contact with the green house and if it doesn't hit the green house it reflects into the green hose.,2
136389,"Both pictures are similar to our solar oven in a few ways. One way is that something keeps solar radiation inside. In picture A the glass keeps the solar radiation in, in picture B the atmosphere keeps the solar radiation in and in our solar oven either plastic wrap or plexiglass keeps solar radiation in. Both of them involve the sun and making things warmer. In all of these some reflection is occurring. In picture A it is the glass, in picture B it is the atmosphere, and in our solar oven the tin foil, if you used it, is reflecting.",5
136373,B because once i put the timfoil and the light hits the timfoil its would go back up.And once it hits it it woud heat up.,2
136377,i choose they both do because the heat is still going into to it and heating it up and also because on picture b the sun is hitting the earth and reflecting off of something ,3
136366,"The first reason why there so similar is that they have to do with the sun. 
Another reason why it is similar is that it's all oe huge cycle.",2
136356,I think that both pictures are similar to a solar oven because we would want the oven to absorb the solar radiation then turn it into heat like how the atmosphere and greenhouse glass did. But we also want it to trap it in and reflect it so it would heat up whatever's inside it.,5
136363,One reason is because the heat would be trapped inside. The other reason is that it would heat whatever is below the glass/atmosphere.,3
136375,Because the greenhouse is made to make things really hot for the way that the plants grow. Also they are alike because they trap heat inside of the house. ,3
136370,I think it would be A because you can see the radiation coming in and it is warming up the plants like an oven would do,3
136391,I chose what I did was look at the picture and it had the glass part looking like the earth.I chose this also because of the it was setup.I also chose this awnser becasue the plants would act a little like the marshmellow.,2
136404,"A solar oven needs to absorb solar energy, and picture A seems to be doing exactly that. ",3
136411,they are slimmer because one they both can trap heat and 2 they can reflect the heat back out.,4
136400,"the atmosphere represents the plastic wrap, and the glass represents the plastic wrap.",2
136460,"One reason that the greenhouse gas was similar to the solar oven was because, they are both trapping heat by using glass or like what we used the foil. Another reason was the way they are made they are trapping the heat which makes it hotter. If it gets hot enough it could possibly cook food.",3
136476,I think they both are like our solar oven because the both show the suns raise coming down and staying in the oven.Also becaus ewe put black paper in the box so the paper will hopefully absorb the suns raise.,4
136462,"Pic A is the same, becasue the greenhouse abosorbs heat and the plants use it. Also the not used heat leaves the greenhouse. Same thing with pic B. Pic B shows the Sun rays going into the atmosphere warming it up. The energy that was not used is going to space. ",4
136504, I think both are similar because one of them is reflecting from the light . Also the other one is absolving the heat .,4
136500,2 reasons are that an oven has a closing surface just like greenhouse gases has a closing. ,2
136490,The all retrieve the light from the sun. They all are solar heat and the solar oven uses heat without electricity. ,4
136505,"Picture A is similar, because the solar radiation gets trapped into the building. This also is the same, because the glass is acting like the plastic wrap in the solar oven.",4
136509,Beaucause the Earth asorbs the heat and the atmoshere is the plasit be geting thhe heat from the sun.,2
136519,It could get some heat and get the heat and trap it inside getting it hot.,3
136495,"They are both like a solar oven because they let in heat and keep most of it in. Also, because they heat what is in the inside.",4
136550,"They both are like a greenhouse, so if I said one was right both would be right, but the main reason it is like a solar oven is because it lets in and traps heat and light, the rays come in through the glass and atmosphere to give us light in heat, it then gets trapped and doesn't escape for a while.",5
136572,The atmosphere traps the heat just like the plastic rap of the solar oven. ,3
136557,They both trap heat in their own way and they both have some heat in the area.,4
136563,they all have a greenhouse gas effect. they also  bounce heat around like the aluminum fiol.,3
136518,"In picture A, the house is absorbing and using heat. Also in picture A, the house is containing heat in an area. I even think picture A is like a solar oven because a solar oven absorbs sunlight and traps the heat inside.",4
136381,"Picture A is similar to a solar oven because with a solar oven, the heat goes inside, something you use on your solar oven that reflects, reflects the heat and keeps it inside the solar oven.",3
136359,They are similar because the sun goes straight through the Plexiglas or plastic wrap depending on what you used. It makes whatever is inside the oven heat up. ,2
136372,"I think picture A is similar to a solar oven because the greenhouse is like the box, and the glass on the greenhouse is like the cover of the solar oven.",2
136382,"One, they both can absorb and trap heat, just like a solar oven. And two, they both have something that reflects heat, a.k.a atmosphere- earth, Aluminum foil- solar oven.",3
136683,because the heat tranfurs to the plants or the heat tranfurs to the earth and both of them don`t have the heat asape,2
136390,"The first picture (picture A) is similar to the boxes because the glass is acting as a reflector and a shield and the things inside are being grown and slightly cooked. Picture two is the greenhouse gasses is the atmosphere is the shield and and the earth is the middle of the box inside and where the heat stays.   
The first picture is in the inside is the plants inside the air outside of the greenhouse is the air outside pf the box letting in the the heat and air into the greenhouse which in this situation is the box. Then finally the second picture picture B the sun is beating down on the earth and the heat and light is reflecting of the earth.",3
136388,"Picture A keeps the heat inside like plastic wrap only it's glass and bigger. Picture B also keeps the heat in because of the atmosphere which is also like the plastic wrap. The darker the buildings the hotter it will be like with the solar oven, the darker the paper the hotter it will be.",4
136362,"They are both similar. They are similar because they use convection, radiation. and conduction just like a solar oven does. They are also similar because heat is being put into an object in both pictures and being reflected but picture A has glass surrounding it and picture B has the atmosphere like the glass. ",3
136374,"Because they both act as a insulator and reflector. 
Also heat can be absorbed and reflected on each one.",3
136380,The plastic wrap on our solar oven is like the glass in a greenhouse and the atmosphere around the earth. It keeps the heat inside a cooks or heating up the inside just like the glass and the atmosphere.,4
136378,"Both pictures get reflected for example pic. A is being reflected by the glass at the top of the green house like a solar oven. Like a solar oven pic A and B are heating something up, in pic A it is the plants, in pic B it is the earth, so in a solar oven the food inside is being cooked.",3
136367,I think they are both similar to the solar oven because in picture A and B they were showing the heat getting trapped in the atmosphere and the green house. when we were working on our solar ovens we were trying to trap the heat in side the oven so it can cook the marshmallow.,4
136352,"They both can trap light and heat from escaping, and also makes it warmer on Earth and in the greenhouse, like a solar oven.",5
136360,Yes they are they have an insulator and are reflecting some heat and taking in some heat. ,3
136379, It takes in solar radiation like the solar oven. It uses glass to keep the heat in just like the  solar oven.,4
6971,The heat that is reflecting is staying inside the earths Atmosphere the sun reflects it bounces. Also because it is hot like an oven.,3
136368,They both have heat come in and keep the heat like you would want for a solar oven. They both also have the heat staying inside of the atmosphere and the greenhouse gasses. ,4
136364,both pictures have the suns rays beating down on them and the pictures have the sun reflecting and absorbing heat.,4
136384,"If the solar oven had plastic wrap or plexiglas then they are both similar. The plastic wrap or plexiglas reflects and conducts heat. Also the things inside (Earth, marshmallow, and plants) need to be heated.",3
136393,"The pictures are similar to a solar oven (with something covering the top), as they both have something covering the top that lets the heat in (atmosphere, glass, cover on top of oven), but only lets some of the heat out. They also all have rays inside of them where the heat bounces around, trying to escape. ",5
136413,They all have something to either trap some heat in and release some heat out and they all have effects in temperature inside that is caused by the sun.,4
136394,Picture A is similar to the solar oven because it lets heat through and it absorbs heats.,2
136405,"I think that that picture A and B are similar to a solar oven because it traps heat in order to grow plants, helps with eccentricity, etc. Another way it is the same as an solar oven is that the atmosphere also reflects heat so that we don't have to much heat so that it gets too hot that we can't even live. ",4
136423,"the plastic on the solar oven traps the solar radiation from the sun inside the box, the box releases inferad from the heat.",4
136398,"These pictures are both similar to a solar oven because they both absorb the heat from the sun and they don't let it escape. Plus, in the pictures the heat spreads through-out the atmosphere and the greenhouse just like a solar oven.",3
136414,I think both are similar because they reflect and absorb light/heat. ,4
136408,"In picture A, the energy is entering the greenhouse but is not able to exit. That is what happened with the solar oven.

In picture B, energy is going down from the sun and when it hits the Earth, it reflects back up. In the solar oven, when the energy hit the aluminum flap, it reflected wherever it was tilted.",5
136420,"Picture B is similar because the sun provides the heat to the Earth and the box. Picture A is similar because the glass reflects the heat back to the plants, the plstic wrap does the same.",3
136419,All three of them trap heat to make something warmer. All of them reflect some heat back.,4
136424,"The are both similar because they all use retain heat, and they all get heat by solar energy.",5
136392,One reason is that picture A is like a solar oven because it's conducting the sun's radiation and trapping that energy or heat in the greenhouse and then it's heating up the inside. It's pretty much goes the same for picture B but it's just a different picture so picture A is like picture B and picture B is like picture A and like I just said it's the same just different pictures.,5
136426,there both bouncing all over the place. and there doing the exact same thing.,3
136685,It shows the light and energy coming in while heating up the area. It also shows the way the energy moves like a solar oven.,3
136403,"Both pictures, picture A and picture B are similar to solar ovens. One reason they are similar is, because the suns heat is coming in the greenhouse to the plants and coming in the atmosphere to the Earth just like how the suns heat comes in the solar ovens through the top. Another reason how picture A and picture B are similar to a solar oven is, because when the suns heat gets into the oven it stays in there and heats up the oven just like how the suns heat comes into the atmosphere and heats the Earth and how the suns heat also comes in the greenhouse and helps the plants grow.",2
136422,I think that its A because some of the sun's heat comes inside the greenhouse and some reflects out of the greenhouse.  Also the heat gets absorbs in the greenhouse.,2
136416,yes because it traps some of the heat but not all of that heat ,3
136425,Picture A is similar because the heat in the greenhouse is getting trapped and the heat in the solar oven gets trapped making hot.,3
136395, Picture A is similar to a solar oven because the glass will insulate the greenhouse like it will insulate our solar oven. Picture B is also similar because most of the heat that hits the solar oven willvet absorbed but a little bit of it will be reflected.,3
136474,"The atmosphere and glass are like the plastic wrap on the solar oven, and the asphalt on our roads attract heat just like the black paper.",2
136467,They are both preventing the heat from leaving increasing the temperature.,4
136463,They are both similar because they both attract and trap the heat.,2
136483,I say they are both similar to a solar oven because they both reflect the heat back into something that takes up the heat.,3
136461,The light is absorbed making it hotter and is used to power other objects just the same as GHgasses ,3
136465,Yes because the solar ovens absorbs the heat and doesn't let it out. ,3
136459,"They both are reflecting and attracting heat, and they both produce heat fixture in both solar radiation and the solar oven resemblance.",2
136485,I picked yes it's similar to picture A because when i did my solar panel we put on a glass and the glass made it heat up plus the foil to and the black paper. Also because the sun will first trap inside the increasing temperature and make it heat up more because in picture A it's in a room with plants and the roof is glass so the sun reflects the glass and the glass will absorb the heat and trap it inside .,3
136455,"My first defense is that the sun is heating the atmosphere. Secondly, which in time (about 4-5 minutes),  would lead up to making it's way inside/on the box, cooking the s'more ingredients accurately and warmly.",2
136453,"First off, they are both conducting sunlight. Second off they are both preventing the heat from leaving, increasing the temperature.",5
136477,"1. reflecting off some thing 

2. both need the sun to heat

3.both have conduction ",3
136517,"I chose that answer because they both let in heat and trap it, they both absorb it, they both trap and provide heat for the things inside, and they both have mixed surfaces that absorb the heat after it passes through their own specialized atmosphere.",4
136496,"plastic wrap concentrates light
Plastic wrap makes it able to trap heat inside",4
136489,"I say that because the sunlight is being trapped inside of the greenhouse, making the heat rise.",4
136511,because we are making heat and there is like an oven in the greenhouse that makes it hot and the solar oven makes it hot inside from the sun just like the greenhouse.,2
136499,"They are both simalar because they both show the greenhouse effect absorbing heat and reflecting heat and, it shows the solar radiation passing through the glass panels or the atmoshphere keeping some heat from escaping.",5
136506,"First of all, they both are similar because they both trap in heat. Second of all, they both conduct heat from the sun like a solar oven.",2
136497,"That is because how the heat goes in and is trapped, also because it warms stuffin a area.",3
136508,"I chose yes, both are similar because the in picture A you can see that light is going to the greenhouse and that is the same thing to picture B.",4
141563,it is the same cause of the heat and that is solor radition and the heat gets trapped.,4
136501,"These are similar because, for one, they are both drawing/collecting heat from the sun, and the both let heat in, and do not let some heat out, much like a solar oven does.",2
136493,They both use solar energy and they both have a layer to keep heat from escaping.,5
136512,If you have a cover that keeps in heat but still lets it in it is like the atmosphere or the glass. Also it heats earth like it would the oven and it keeps earth warm.,3
136503,They are similar because the oven has plastic wrap acting like the atmosphere and the greenhouse has the glass panels. Also they all have room for the heat to move around to make more heat.,3
136498,Picture A is similar because the greenhouse is giving off heat to what's inside the greenhouse. Picture B is also similar because the atmosphere is holding some of the heat but is also giving off some of the heat.  ,3
136520,,1
136494,Picture A is similar because the greenhouse is giving its heat to what's inside of it. Picture B is similar because it is holding some of the heat but also reflecting some of the heat.,3
136514,I chose picture A because just like the solar oven the glass acts like the plastic wrap my group used when assembling the solar oven heat comes in as the glass panels are trying to keep some of it in and some of it comes out while some of the heat reflects out and that's why I chose picture  because that's why picture B is similar to our solar ovens.,2
136522,Picture A is similar to a solar oven because the greenhouse is trapping the heat inside it and the heat is coming in through the glass. ,3
136558,Because heat is going right through the glass just like when it  goes through plastic wrap. And it needs the suns heat to cook.,2
136567,It is because it gets the heat and it bounces all around and  does it agin,2
136555,In both picture the heat that goes inside stays inside and in both picture the heat from the sun heats the object.,2
136571,They are like giant green houses,2
136551,the plastic wrap acts like a greenhouse and our oven will keep our gases  ,2
136566,They are working the same way. They are doing the same thing. And they are heating up the area.,3
136549,"Light comes down and hits the solar oven, then it reflects. That is exactly what is happening in bot of the image. Light also goes threw the roof of the green house and the atmosphere, just like the plastic wrap on the box. I know this from are lab when we did the box's with albito and green hose gasses.",4
136355,"I think that picture A is similar to a solar oven because it absorbs heat just like a solar oven cam. Also, heat can get trapped inside the greenhouse or box, and will bounce everywhere inside.",3
136492,The light is both being trapped in also the light looks like it is going in circles.,4
136361,They both are like a solar oven because they both bring heat in and it heats up the place that it goes into. Another reason is because they both have something for the heat to go through and at the same time it keeps it in.,4
136354,They are both have something like plastic wrap like the atmosphere and the glass and the both use solar radiation to heat up.,4
136387,"In a solar oven you want to keep the heat in but allow it into the oven, just like the glass or the atmosphere do.  They also use rays from the sun to warm the area.  You cause more heat by hving the particles bounce around resulting as heat.",4
136369,"for the first reason the green house keeps the heat in like a solar oven.
 This heat energy is then used for it's own reasons like a solar oven.",4
136351,The both are absorbing and reflecting heat from the sun.,2
136421,"1. The glass is keeping the heat in the green house and the plexi-glass or the plastic rap do the same thing for the oven.
2. Once the heat is in the green house, It cant leave. Same goes for the oven.",3
136397,"It is similar because the greenhouse is similar to a box how the heat can escape, also becaus the glass or plastic wrap acts like an insulator.",2
136412,"the greenhouse looks like a box and how the green hose gadsses never escape, it also shows the glass rough witch reminds me of the plastic wrap i used on my solar oven.",2
136399,they heat making them grow the crops.,2
136402,"The heat is going into the green house and not reflecting, just like the oven. Picture B shows the sun going on Earth, but once it hit the Earth it reflects off the Earth.",2
136396,I picked this because all the tin foil and and dark colored paper attract heat.,2
136407,"A solar oven is a box, a greenhouse is like a box. Also, the energy from sun is needed in both. ",3
136406,The solar oven does reflect but its ment to reflect it insideof the box to heat it up and picture A and B are soppose to reflect the solar radition.,4
136417,I think picture B because it has reflection on it and the second reason is that the sun will create and reflect to earth.,2
136410,beacouse we are trying to make the food inside get heat.,2
136409,,1
136450,It will let heat in and will not let most of it escape.,3
136451,Because in picture a the glass is absorbing the solar energy. Plus in picture b it is reflecting the solar energy but in a greenhouse the solar energy is absorbed so that the plants can get there solar energy supply.,4
136468,In think they're the same because they both keep air in and they both get reflection from the sun.,4
136480,"The reason why I say picture A because, the roof is the protector, and in Solar ovens the plastic wrap/ clear glass is the protector of the solar oven and the heat is getting directed into the box/Greenhouse.",2
136482,"Picture A and Picture B: They both have Solar Radiation coming through the ""top"" of the project. They also both keep the heat inside and don't let it out. ",5
136457,"1.) They're both heating up something within them. A being the plants and B being whatever is living on Earth. Also the solar oven being food.

2.) They all involve heating things up with light and solar radiation.",4
136456,"It is because it shows how the greenhouse effect works, which is similar to a solar oven, and it has both an insulating and conducting section.",2
136454,"1. In the solar ovens we need something on the top to help heat come in.
2.It also traps heat in like the atmosphere does.",3
141561,Two reason why is because they both are showing hoe heat goes in and heats up the Earth and the atmosphere. It also shows how it traps the heat in and then lets it out.,4
136475,They are similar because the earth is like the house on the other picture.,3
141559,well the reason i picked A was because like a solar oven the sun is puting heat in the green house makeing it heat up and B is a know because the sun is not the only thing heating things up their are also gasses and chemicles that create heat.,2
136481,Picture A and B are like a solar oven because there can be plastic wrap or etc. that acts like the glass of a greenhouse or the atmosphere. ,3
136469,Neither are the same because they are both leating heat out and solor ovens do not.,2
136507,"I think picture A is similar to a solar oven because, just like a solar oven, the glass of the greenhouse focuses heat and traps it within afterwards. A greenhouse and a solar oven also both have something within them that needs exposure to the effects of the sun.",3
136502,"1.When solar radiation comes it turns into heat.

2.When the heat is in earths atmosphere most of it won't get out.",4
136515,There both because both use the sun for heat and the absorb the heat but also reflex a little. ,3
136553,They are both similar because they are both adsorbing just like our solar ovens adsorb,2
136583,"1. they both trap heat
2. they make things warmer when in direct sunlight",4
136546,"They are both similiar becasue they have different materials or layers to trap or reflect the sunlight. They also work like a solar oven, keep in heat, make the thing inside hot or cold.",5
136574,,1
136570,"The way a solar oven works is by putting it in the sun and letting it get heated up by the solar and UV rays. In picture A and B the solar rays go through the glass/atmosphere, get trapped, create heat, and warm up the greenhouse/Earth. ",5
136569,"Picture A is similar to a solar oven because it has glass turning solar, to infrared radiation. Both pictures are similar because they are trapping heat.",5
136580,"1. They are both similar to solar ovens because the sun radiates through the greenhouse the same way.
2. Another reason they are similar is because they both use conduction, convection, and radiation the same way.",4
136564,"Both pictures A and B are similar to solar ovens because in picture A, the heat goes into the greenhouse but cannot get out.  In the solar ovens, the heat goes in through the plastic wrap and into the solar oven but it cannot get back out through the plastic wrap and it is trapped. In picture B, heat from the sun goes through Earths atmosphere, but not a lot, and it stays in the atmosphere because it cannot get back out of the atmosphere.  The solar ovens work the same way, where the heat gets trapped inside by the plastic wrap.",4
136559,The heat is trapped inside (for the most part) on both of them ,4
136561,,1
136576,"my response to question 3 is that both pictures a and b are similar to a solar oven because when hot air enters through the glass and atmosphere they stay and not much air is let out. they are similar because air pass through glass,atmosphere,and plastic wrap and heats up the inside. ",3
136556,I said neither are similar because (1) Solar oven-depending on what you use-don't block sun rays.,3
136560,Because they both absorb and they both reflect.,3
139536,Both A and B are similar to a solar oven because heat is trapped inside between the atmosphere or glass. The heat is caused by light from the sun which is beaming through the atmosphere which hits Earth or the plants.,5
139541,Both allow sunlight to heat up the inside and also retain the heat energy.,5
139545,"Yes, both are similar because they both trap heat and store that energy inside.",5
139542,The solar oven is man-made and uses reflective materials to absorb as much sunlight as possible. The Earth does not use any reflective material to absorb sunlight. ,3
139540,"The solar oven would absorb energy from the sun, the greenhouse is similar to a solar oven, because it keep the energy inside of the greenhouse, they would not reflect as much energy as the earth.",4
139866,These two pictures both go through barrier before reaches the plant or the Earth. They both create heat also.,3
139544,"1. Both pictures trap heat like solar ovens do. 
2. Both have a source of energy that enters through a glass and that energy in the form of heat cannot escape.",5
139864,They are both similar because they use the sun's natural energy to heat up things inside of its barrier. ,4
139863,"They both trap in heat such as a oven.
They both use the energy from the sun.  ",5
139495,The pictures are similar because the sun's radiation is trapped and used as a source of energy. The solar oven also has a glass like material that takes the light from the sun.,5
139494,"Pictures A and B are similar to a solar oven because a solar oven absorbs heat but then traps it so that an object can be heated. Similarly, a greenhouse the greenhouse effect have the same process. Also, a greenhouse has glass to trap heat, the greenhouse effect has the atmosphere, and a solar oven has metal and glass that trap heat.",4
139492,"Both a greenhouse and a solar oven absorb heat from the sun to heat whatever that is inside. However, unlike the atmosphere of the Earth, a solar oven does not release the heat. ",2
139824,Picture A is similar because a solar oven needs heat to come in and to keep the heat in and not going back out so the food will cook and stay warm. Picture B has a similar effect with the atmosphere where heat gets stuck and trapped. ,4
139482,"1. We will not be using the atmosphere to trap heat in our oven, we will probably us glass or something that lets in radiation but traps the heat. 
2. The insides of our solar oven will probably be much hotter than our atmosphere thus it needs to be enclosed. ",4
139493,"1. They both are able to absorb the heat.

2. They both trap heat.",4
139483,"1. They both absorb energy/radiation from the sun to keep a certain area warm. 
-like how a solar oven absorbs the suns radiation to cook something or keep it warm. 
2. Both the pictures has some sort of material to keep the warm from the sun from escaping which is what the class will try to do for the solar ovens. ",5
139834,They both take in heat and trap it. A solar oven has properties that does not allow heat to leave.,4
139515,One reason is that a solar oven also uses the greenhouse effect to heat up the inside. The second reason is that a solar oven uses panels that allow certain light to go through while keeping infrared radiation inside.,4
139831,Both are similar to a solar oven because a solar oven is able to let heat energy in and retain most of that energy. ,5
139525,They are both similar to a solar oven because they trap air in. The solar oven uses the concept of trapping heat in order to cook something.,4
139514,Both pictures are similar to a solar oven because they both use the greenhouse effect to increase the temperatures of the inside. They have the glass/atmosphere to trap in the energy from the sun.,5
139520,"Both pictures are similar to the solar oven. In picture A, the glass panel is similar to a solar oven because in a solar oven, the solar panel takes in energy which serves as heat. In picture B, the atmosphere takes in the energy from sun onto earth like the energy from the sun to the solar panel to heat up an oven.",4
139518,"As the sun's radiation enters the greenhouse, heat energy will be trapped, thus warming the greenhouse.  The sun's radiation also enters the atmosphere, but some of the energy is reflected while the rest is kept on Earth.  This energy will heat up the Earth or greenhouse and they will eventually become like an oven, slowly heating up.  Another similarity is that they both use the sun to maintain heat.",5
139527,A solar oven utilizes sunlight to heat up the food whereas in the pictures the sunlight is heating up the Earth.,3
139506,"These are similar because these 2 progresses are known as green house effect, and it basically amplifies the heat.",3
139832,They are both similar because they both accept light and the inside heats up.,4
139833,"The pictures are similar to a solar oven because a solar oven operates by trapping heat from the sun to cook things. Heat is also prevented from leaving, just like how the glass and atmosphere works ",2
139505,"Similar to a solar oven, both pictures portray heat being trapped by a layer of certain material. In addition, both pictures gain their heat energy from the sun, which is also where the solar oven gains its heat energy from.",5
139508,"Both pictures are like a solar oven because the sun's rays are able to penetrate through and they each have some sort of ""container"" that does not allow all of the heat energy to leave once they enter. Also, the light that reflects back also heats up the interior, like a solar oven does to heat something up.",4
139507,I'm not really familiar with a solar oven but I know that it is a box and that it has reflective metal panels at the top. It seems that a solar oven will absorb the heat from the sun's light rays but it will also reflect some of that energy back out which seems pretty similar to picture A and B.,4
139836,Because Heat are being trapped inside earth but also releases UV rays.,3
139526,Both pictures A and B are similar to a solar oven because a solar oven traps heat inside with the use of a good insulator as the material. Another reason is that as the sunlight hits the the solar oven some of it bounces back or escapes like how the heat is trapped inside the sun rays. ,5
139528,Because for a solar oven to work you need heat to come through and stay in the oven. Both A and B allow heat in and contain the energy. ,5
139521,"The first reason is picture A contain a layer, glass, that prevent heat from escaping. The second reason is picture A store heat inside that warm the environment, and prevent convection happen inside.",3
139517,"A solar oven uses solar light to keep heat inside the oven in order to cook and both the greenhouse and earth keep heat inside. Also, they all use solar energy.",5
139861,One they are both keeping the heat inside and second they are both using the energy from the sun.,5
140326,I think they are similar because maybe this is how the solar oven works. ,3
139543,Since picture a and b works similarly a solar oven also has this type of process. The solar oven traps heat in and try to keep as much of it inside and not let it out just like a green house.,4
139865,A solar oven takes in light. A solar oven also lets in the light but traps it.,4
139538,"Solar ovens need sunlight to heat things up just like how the plant and Earth need the sunlight to function; plants need sunlight to grow and humans need sunlight to receive some vitamin D. Also, solar ovens use the trap the sunlight and convert it into energy like how plants trap the sunlight and convert it into energy for it to use. ",3
139533,"One reason why it is similar is because we are going to be using heat from the sun that's trapped in a box-like contraption in order to make an oven.
Another reason why it is similar is because we need to figure out how we can get the most amount of sunlight or heat into our ovens to heat up the oven. ",2
139539,Both are similar because all 3 reflect uv rays and covert them to infrared waves. Conduction happens when the uv rays hit the ground.,3
139537,It's picture A because it uses solar radiation and mirrors to convert and absorb heat from the solar radiation and the greenhouse traps the heat more. Picture B is similar but the atmosphere does not absorb all the heat that reflects from the surface and the atmosphere also reflects some of the solar radiation back to space so Picture A will be the most similar to a solar oven.,4
139862,"The purpose of the greenhouse is to retain heat, it allows heat to enter and allows a minimal amount of heat to leave the room just as a solar oven does. Picture B is not very similar because it balances the heat more than the greenhouse does.",3
139535,"Picture A shows a green house, which its purpose is to attract more heat, just like a solar oven. The Sun's light waves are able to penetrate the glass but are not as able to escape easily, which is necessary for the solar oven in order to heat up food. ",2
139534,Pictures A is similar to a solar oven because the energy to power up a solar oven comes from the sun to heat up food inside. Picture B is also similar to a solar oven because the solar oven absorbs the heat energy from the sun and uses it. ,4
139487,"Both picture A and B show examples of hot heat from the sun is transferred onto a glass panel or the atmosphere, which will heat up the inside components. This will be similar to a solar oven because the outside will make the inside warmer to cook things with.",2
139826,Picture A is a greenhouse which serves the same purpose as the solar oven as it keeps heat in. The second picture shows the earth being heated by the sun just like solar ovens heat up food and objects.,4
139481,Picture B is the same as Picture A because of why Picture B is named the greenhouse effect and a solar oven is the same because a solar oven is absorbing heat energy while trapping it in the oven to not escape.,4
139485,"Solar ovens absorbs the heat that is introduce and then keeps the heat inside like the picture A and B. Also like picture A and B, the solar oven does not take in all the heat only the ones that is necessary to make the environment warm enough then the rest of the radiation will be reflected out of the solar oven.",5
139497,Both A and B are similar to a solar oven because they both keep heat inside of a certain boundary and they keep that heat inside which causes the temperature between the boundary to increase.,4
139479,"Both are examples of the greenhouse effect.
We will probably be creating the same effect for our solar oven.",3
139480,You can use the principles from each one to create a solar oven. A solar oven uses heat absorbed in this way to heat up whatever it is you are trying to cook. ,3
139496,"In both pictures, sun energy is being used. Additionally, heat is being trapped. As a result, both the plants and the Earth are being warmed.",5
139488,"In the two pictures, heat rays enter the place but only some are able to leave. In a solar oven, I'm assuming that heat enters it and only some leave, to keep the inside of the oven warm. In both pictures, the insides are kept warm because there is more heat entering than leaving. I'm assuming that this is also how solar ovens work.",5
139477,"I think both are similar because they both have the same concept, to trap light and heat inside, sunlight comes in and heat stays in, and they both use the same energy source.",5
139486,Because a solar oven traps the heat insde the component to heat up the temperature within the oven. Since trapping heat within the oven heats up the side like the greenhouse effect that traps heat inside to heat up the surrounding it is very similar to the two images given.,4
139830,"The light from the sun becomes trapped into the oven causing it to heat up, just like the greenhouse effect on earth. ",4
139501,Both are similar because there is an area where heat is allowed to come and go.,3

139490,Both images could be the same as the solar oven since they practice the same roles. Both allow solar radiation to enter and activate some sort of energy (heat) and afterwards shoots it back out. ,4
139491,"both picture A and picture B are similar to solar oven because they all demonstration the same concept, of heat entering, and trapping heat and keep a area warm. ",4
139478,"1) The solar oven allows for the heat to stay inside 
2) It uses the radiation from the sun to power itself
3) Uses the heat from the sun to create",4
139827,they are both the same because light comes in heats them up and then goes back out into the atmosphere as a different type of energy,4
139498,"1. They all are trying to prevent heat from escaping. 
2. They all prevent heat from escaping by using something to reflect it back to where it came from. ",4
139499,Picture A is similar to a solar oven because heat can be gained but the glass causes the heat to stay inside of the oven heating up what is inside.,2
139823,"1) Both contain heat energy.

2) The heat is trapped in the oven like a greenhouse to keep the food warm.",4
139513,,1
139523,I think that they both are similar to solar oven because they have a way to trap in the heat like how an oven is close so that heat does not escape and that they both use energy from the sun.,5
139524,"A solar oven uses panels to capture and reflect light from the sun; on Earth, the atmosphere acts as panels and in a greenhouse, the glass acts as a panel. They are all like filters. 

All three capture heat energy, using it to warm up whatever is on the other end of the filter. ",4

139536,"Both pictures show how solar and infrared radiation enters through an enclosed space. In addition, it also shows how the radiation is reflected, but still trapped with the enclosed space like solar ovens do too.",5
139541,"Both allow solar radiation to go through because they are transparent. In addition, they also retain the heat energy.",5
139497,Both pictures show similarities as to how a solar oven traps heat. The atmosphere and the solar oven both release some heat.,4
139487,A solar oven works by trapping heat energy from the sun and both greenhouse and atmosphere does the same thing.,5

139836,Because Heat are being trapped inside earth but also releases UV rays.,3

139538,"Both picture A and B attract heat like the solar oven and trap the heat. Also, they both have materials to reflect the heat out.",2
139533,"One reason is because they both show the heat from the sun being emitted towards the atmosphere and the atmosphere, and the heat from the sun is being absorbed into the shed and the earth.

139514,"The sun's energy is radiated inside and absorbed by objects.
The heat released by the object inside is trapped.",4

139882,It is similar because the greenhouse is absorbing heat just like how a solar oven does. They both use solar energy in order for the experiment to work.,4
139869,"I said it was similar, because it was set up equally. And it shows how everything is in relation to convection, conduction, and radiation.",2
139847,"The solar oven and both pictures have something to keep the heat in.
They also use light to heat up air.",5
139879,,1
139853,"They are both similar because they trap heat into the house or atmosphere and heat goes in to the house and radiation come from the sun. Also, it reflects infraed radiatino back to the surface of the heat. ",5
139747,"It's like a box with flaps, it has glass like plexiglass or plastic wrap.",2
139774,"Picture A and B are both similar to a solar oven because:
-the plant uses sunlight to heat the plants
-picture B is also trapping heat energy",5
153977,The solar oven will let the heat get in and then it will not let them get out AS EASILY as the green house does or the atmosphere does.,3
153978,They both are bringing sunlight in without using electricity. They both are using the sun to do something.,4
153979,1. they both have to do with sun. 2.they both are green houses .,2
153980,"Yes, because in both pictures the heat is not bouncing out but staying in. Secondly, both have heat",4
153981,"From what I know about solar ovens, they are similar to the box models in the previous questions, or maybe even the same. That process in the box models are the same as what is going on in the top pictures. It's just the a and b pictures are a larger area. Sun rays head into glass, or in some cases, atmosphere. If there is a material that doesn't allow sunlight to pass through, the sun rays bounce off of the already created heat and turn into infrared radiation.",5
153982,"Yes, because in both pictures the sun goes in and than it goes out. In each picture they both get warm, but not hot.",3
153983,A because sun can come through glass but heat does not just come to earth and just bounce off.,2
153984,A is correct because the oven will suck in the heat and because it has a green house with plants,2
153985,isaidso ithinkso,1
153987,the heat is big and the air makes it warm,2
153989,"I think this because solar ovens bring in the heat then the goes out. Also, solar oven are ran by the sun.",2
153991,"Two reasons are that a solar oven is supposed to keep heat in and both pic. show that happening. Second, is that the heat keeps the inside warm in a solar oven. Both pictures show that when the heat stays in the inside is warmed up like an ovem.",4
153992,They both have plants eloved and soloa planels,2
153993,1. Look at my first answer 2. There both like a sience experiment.,2
153994,#1)- The green house is a box. #2)- Sun rays are getting in and heating it.,3
153996,They are both similar because one is showing the project and other one is showing the sun come into the earth like a oven would be like.,3
153997,picture A is because the roof is like how the sun will hit it and give it heat but bousence off,2
153999,They are both similer becuse the solor oven  keeps heat in just like both of the pictures.,4
154000,the heat is most likely going to get trapped in so it heats up.,3
154026,"Picture A is similar because the heat goes in, but it stays in there and doesn't escape.",3
154107,I think picture A is similar to a solar oven because a solar panel attracts heat by the sun and the solar oven attracts heat as well. They both have a sun panel to attract the sun to get heat.,2
154108,"One reason why both pictures are similar is because in the solar oven model, it showed that when the solar radiation came through the box, it turned into heat or infrared radiation, similar to how the air is different in the inside of the greenhouse or the atmosphere than the outside. Another reason why both pictures are similar is because  both solar radiation rays get stuck in the box or greenhouse, and cannot get out.",5
154109,One reason I think both picture are similar to a solar oven because they both keep in hot air. Another reason I think both pictures are similar to a solar oven is because they both have the sun reflecting on them.,4
154111,"One reason is the solar oven heats up the inside of the box like the pictures in A"" and ""B"".",3
154113,~Because a green house by its self its a big solar oven ~Also because with a when warm air comes into a green house all of the air stays in there,2
154114,The first reason is that the atmosphere can trap heat so it reflects it back to trap it.The second reason is that a solar oven traps heat by reflecting it.,3
154115,They both trap in air like a solar oven does to heat things.,4
154117,Picture B is similar to a solar oven because the earth is using heat and energy to keep it in and in a solar oven it uses eat and energy to make something/to see if it works.A second reason is that is heating up the earth like a solar oven would.,3
154120,One reason is that a solar oven collects heat and so does green houses in picture A. Second reason is that Earth collects heat just like picture A (like solar oven),2
154121,because the solor overn heats the plants up.,2
154123,because they both sun ray for it to get warm in so the warm wont go out. also the sun ray go up but then go down.,5
154126,There similer because in the solar oven the the heat bonces off the top of it,2
154129,One reason is it will reflect back to the sky in this case outer space.Two is the sun's heat or solar energy will come back as heat.,3
154131,My first reason is that the cardboard box will keep the the heat in. My second reason is that whatever is inside of the cardboard box will start heating up just like the earth.,3
154133,Why is B similar to A because the both get sun and the sun comes out to like tomatoes when they grow they get sun to grow or sunlight that's why B similar to A/,3
154136,the heat does not exsape the heat stase in side,3
154137,The picture A is similar to a solar oven because in the picture you see that the green house has heat hitting it or has heat trapped inside. My second reason is that keep the heat from escaping.,3
154138,Because A is geting heat and not letting in go out . Also B keeps the air from leaving so it is like the same thing,3
154139,yes they are similar because they both go though a shield and the heat gets trapd and it gets warm.,3
154142,They are both similar because they both heat up and they both have a atmosphere or a glass window,3
154149,picture (a) has the glass to ceep it in. picture (b) is like the glass in pic (a).,2
154154,They are both similar because they are both getting sun and light.,4
154156,The green houses at the earth and earths atmosphere traps the energy,4
154302,they are both similar because they both trap heat,4
154304,i think that they are both simaller to the sollar oven because all three have the sun involved and they all trap heat,4
154306,1. Picture A is like a big oven that heats the plants inside. 2. Picture B is also like an oven; the atmosphere  is the window to heat and the earth is the being heated.,2
154308,One reason is that the A picture is a greenhouse where the heat may enter but not leave the green house for the heat. Another reason the B picture is correct is because the suns rays come into the earth but the heat does not escape.,5
154309,"Yes, they are because",1
154312,yes because it stayes inside like a solar oven.,3
154313,Because it keeps in heat and doesn't let it out.,3
154314,Greenhouses are much smaller but do the same thing as the Earth but to keep plants growing. Earth's heat can cause global warming.,2
154315,1. A) is similar to solar ovens because it is using hot air. 2. A) is also similar because it is making something you can eat when it is done growing.,2
154316,It is similar because it heats up the green house and traps heat.,3
154317,There both similar because its shooting out sun ray and bring back more sun rays.,3
154320,A) the solar ovens have a boundry that is the cardboard that acts like either the glass or it acts like the atmosphere in the case of the picture showing earths greenhouse effect.     B) the sun heats up both kind of like an oven and the point of the boxes is toohave the greenhouse effect which is kind of like an oven and all three mimik an oven and/or greenhouse effect,3
154328,I think so because it's like the heat is coming to a solar oven and then letting the heat back out. Also there the same because b is just what it would look like from the outside and a is just what it looks like from the inside.,2
154331,My answer is yes picture a is similar because in picture a the heat stays in and in picture b it reflects off the earth and another reasons is that picture a has a clear roof to have the sun go threw it.,3
154333,they both show heat going in and staying in/not coming out,4
154334,earth because we get sun from the sun witch makes it simular to the soler uven,2
154339,Picture A is similar to the solar oven because hot air is in the structure and hot air is in a solar oven.,2
154340,because it can cook something by the sun and the sun shining at the plants,2
154341,you can cook something and the sun shinning at the plants,2
154344,Picture A is similar because the solar oven traps heat to keep the thing inside it warm. It also lets the heat go through then makes the inside warm.,3
154846,Both are similar because they have light/heat coming through going into something like the plants in picture A and the ground in picture B and a solar oven has something in it that needs light/heat. They also have some kind of shield protecting it from getting too much light.,4
154847,I think both pictures are similar because they retain heat as well as lose heat like a solar oven just on a bigger scale.,4
154914,"Picture A is because it brings energy in, but does not let it out. Picture B is because it keeps the Sun's rays temporarily in.",4
154915,It is similar becaues  it stop radeaion from coming in.,3
153978,"They all are bringing in sun rays and using light to do something. For example, picture A is using sunlight for growing plants, picture B is using it to bring heat to the Earth, and the solar oven is using it to cook things.",4
153979,picture a is similar because it collects sun,2
153982,Picture A is like a solar oven because some of the heat bounces off and some of the heat goes in like a solar oven.,2
154914,They are both similar because they both show the Greenhouse Effect which is also how a solar oven heats up.,3
153991,Both have something keeping heat in and both are heating object/s.,4
154107,There similar because it shows the sun reflecting of the earth and arrows are reflecting off the earth.,3
154117,"I picked b because the earth is what is getting heating , the atmosphere is what is keeping the heat inside it,the sun is what is heating the earth,and space is just surrounding all of the stuff.",3
154126,My reasons that picture B is like the solar oven because the heat stays in and the heat warms up the food or drink.,3
154111,They both are similar because both pictures attract heat and then trap in  teh heat.,4
154108,One reason why both pictures are similar to solar ovens is because they both show something trapping heat in. A second reason is because they get their heat from the sun.,4
154133,My to reasons are that the suns heat is in both pictures and they both have the sun pointing in the earth,3
154113,Because both are like solar ovens because both of them keep the heat in and don't let any heat out.,4
154120,Both pictures are similar because both are using the sun in their example pictures. Second reason is that both are showing about the sun reflecting onto the Earth and the solar oven and effecting the temperatures.,3
154137,The green house is like a solar oven because the green hose has heat inside and also because the green house has heat trapped inside by the sun.,3
154114,The first reason is that in the green house it traps in all of the heat and lets some of it go.The second reason is that they both heat things up with the sun.,4
154121,it makes solor heat waves,3
154131,A is similar because there is something inside being kept warm and the heat gets trapped with the heat .,3
154125,thay look the same,2
154123,because like the glass palstic is like it it traps the heat.,3
154313,Because they both trap in heat and get heat from a light source.,5
154315,They both are because the sunrays hit off the bottom of the box and the sunrays also get held in the box.,5
154304,they are similar because picture a and b and a solar oven all use the sun to heat up the inside of the structure. they are also all alike because the atmosphere and the glass and the cover for the solar oven all trap heat inside the structure.,4
154704,"A solar oven has to let sun rays in, but trap them, so it can heat up. The pictures show this too, the atmosphere and panels instead of plexiglass. They are also similar because they both are using the sun to heat up.",5
154303,A is similar because A is showing the heat getting absorbed by the structure while B is showing the greenhouse affects on Earth. And the solar oven works from when absorbing heat to cook and/or grow something.,2
154309,"Yes, they're both similar to our solar oven. The first reason why I think the two pictures are similar to a solar oven are that they both show conduction, convection, and radiation, just like a solar oven. The second reason why they are both similar to a solar oven are they both show the heat leaving and entering the atmosphere/greenhouse. This will happen to our solar oven, even though we can't see it like we can in the pictures.",3
154312,they are related because they both relate heat,2
154302,Two reasons I think that picture a similar to a solar oven is because the green house traps heat inside like the solar oven does.,3
154314,Picture A is more like a solar oven because it has glass on the top like a solar oven would,2
154317,They both look similar because its shooting beams in and shooting beams out my other reason is because it keeps heat in.,4
154320,"Because they both have a greenhouse effect, just like what the solar oven does and what it is based around, and both have some sort of barrier for the sun to go into and be trapped in.",4
154344,One reason why they are both similar is because they both are trapping in some heat like the solar oven. Another reason why they both are similar is because the first picture is radiation to trap heat in from space and the second picture traps some heat in and lets some heat escape.,5
153997,the both are because picture a shows how the height will stay in the box and B shows how the trapes it in the box,4
153989,I think this because one the solar oven brings in heat and two the sun's rays are the same in every example.,4
154000,because that's what we were trying to do because it sounded like something  smart to do,2
153987,i think by the air,2
153981,"1. Both pictures are similar to a solar oven because they all of similar materials. One group is like the glass in the green house. For the solar oven, it is either plexi glas or plastic wrap. For picture B, it would be the atmosphere holding the heat back. They also have a heat/light source and an object to bounce off of. 2. They all allow some kind of object to heat up. In some cases its food, in others its plants, and sometimes a planet. (most likely earth)",4
153980,It lets heat in and does't let it out. Also It gets hotter the more heat it gets.,3
153996,There two examples are similar because there the same picture but a diffrent way to show it.,3
154026,Picture A is similar because it lets the heat in.  Picture B is similar because it keeps heat in.,3
153985,"They are both similar, because the glass reflects the heat around and so does the atmosphere. The glass and the atmosphere also act as a shield and keeps the heat in.",4
153999,they both keep the heat to heat up what you need and both have the sun rays.,5
154138,Because it the green house is like the oven it stores energy. Also it does not let the heat out.,4
154115,"Yes both are similar to a solar oven because they both trap in heat from the sun, which is what the solar oven does.",4
154109,Picture A is similar because the house is like the box and the glass is like Plexiglas.,3
154306,"A, the green house is like a huge solar oven and B, the earth is a bigger solar oven with rising temperatures.",2
154334,B.) is because it shows half of the world is getting heat wile the other is cooling down .... and the green house has only one side getting heat witch is bad.,2
154340,A is because the sun in staying,2
154846,Two reasons why the pictures similar to a solar oven are that the material that goes on top of the box is just like the atmosphere or glass and the box is just like the Earth or the greenhouse.,3
154149,because the apnosphere and the glass are almost the same.,2
154129,I think this because it allows heat to come in. Another is in will heat the core.,2
154156,Because the greenhouse is at earth. The glass of the greenhouse traps the heat.,3
153995,Picture A and B,2
154915,It is like the solar oven because they all have radiation and they have a light to get hot.,4
153983,I say both because the first picture is a house and heat is coming through the glass and giving heat to the plants to help them grow and the second picture pretend the atmosphere is a box and the heat is coming in through the box and gets trapped inside the atmosphere/box.,4
153993,"1. There like glass. 
2. And there like some of the materials you can use for your solar oven.",2
153992,"it' cumfuing,it's better",1
153816,"1. A solar oven is actually most effective if it is designed like a greenhouse.
2. Solar ovens utilize the greenhouse effect, where solar radiation heats up gas.",3
153818,They both trap light to heat up something. The light from the sun is used in all three.,5
153822,they both are because picture a is showing solar powered plants. and b is showing sun reflecting off sola rpannels.,3
153823,Both are similar because the earth collects the suns energy and so does the green house just like a solar oven.,4
153824,"Well, picture A is similar to a solar oven because it takes  in heat and doesn't let much out, causing the heat to rise up to high temperatures. Picture B is similar to a solar oven because the heat from the sun comes in and the atmosphere takes it to rise temperature.",2
153826,because in the real greenhouse the sun comes in then goes out fast like in a wide and short solar oven. and in the other depiction of a green house the sun comes in but takes a while to go out like in a tall and skinny solar oven.,2
153827,"the radiation does not come out
both of the pictures keep the heat in",5
153830,"They were both similar because the glass of the green house acts like the atmosphere of the Earth which also acts like the window of a solar oven. The glass,atmosphere, and window keep energy inside the object it's giving energy to.",5
153831,B is because the air is going in and out.,2
153832,the sun is heating the green house.,2
153834,One reason it is similar is that solar ovens keep the heat in like the picture. Another reason it is simiar is that the radiation does not go in just like the greenhouse.,4
153835,I think the greenhouse is lik a  olar oven because the air comes in and then it stys in like a olar oven. It is also lik a solar oven becaue  the air is always hot in both a solar oven and a greenhouse,3
153836,Picture B is similar because I saw some energy leave the box with the computer program and the picture here shows that some of the energy leaves the box and here the picture shows how some energy leaves the Earth.,3
153837,A is similar because it's a greenhouse and the greenhouse can relate to a solar oven. Also because the radiation can go inside and effect the plants growth.,3
153838,i chose both of then because they both are the same thing the only difference is the piture,3
153843,both don't neither look like a solar oven because one is a house and one is the earth,2
153844,They are similar because both of then give heat like the solar oven  and with all of them heat also comes out.,2
153848,"They are both similar because the dotted line is the glass.
Another reason they are both similar is that the Earth is the plants. It shows that the Earth is getting the sunlight, which grows fruits or vegetables.",4
153852,The greenhouse is similar to Earth because the greenhouse reflects like a mirror. The Earth also reflects like a mirror,2
153854,The heat is going in to the house like natural heat and they are using it like solar.,2
153856,Because they both get energy from the sun in my opinion.,4
153859,the anserwser is A because it traps the ray from the sin and makes them into infrared and turn them it to heat cells,4
153863,Because it shows that  it iss heating up,2
153864,"(1) they are both similar because they both have the solar energy going strati to the object
(2)   they are also similar because they both are like a solar oven in the green house the glass heats up the plant or whats inside the picture B it is also like a solar oven because the sun beams down on the planet which makes the planet hot.",4
153905,It shows how the heat will rise the oven's temperature and how the heat will exit.,2
153908,"1. One reason is that both are are collecting heat
2. Another reason is that they both collect heat and doesn't let the heat leave",3
153909,Both picture trap the waem inside just like a solar oven. Another reason is tinfoil is kind of like glass and they both atract the sun.,4
153910,"1. The glass panels keep the heat from escaping.
2.It is also closed.",3
153911,"one both sun rays bounce off a solid object and back into space
two both solid objects have something growing in the place",4
153913,"because the both get hot air
both gets hot air and produces air",3
153914,"Yes, they  are both similar to a solar oven. They are both similar to a solar oven because the sun i the use of energy. The sun goes into the greenhouse (solar oven) and can leave the solar oven (greenhouse).",4
153915,they both need sun,3
153916,I think picture B is more similar because the some of the heat bounces back out like the solar oven.,2
153917,"1.They are a like because they reflect the sun 
2.They also are a like because they are like solar ovens",3
153918,you need sunlight for the soler oven and you need to work,3
153919,I think picture A represents it the most because the glass lets the sun in but doesnt let it back out. Also because the plants are in somthin that heats them.,3
153921,I think a because there is heat coming into the green house like the heat going into a solar oven.,2
153922,it acts like a very slight oven,2
153923,My first reason is that it keeps the earth warm and my next reason is that kind of sucks in the heat and doesn't release it so it keeps the earth warm,3
153924,because they both give heat they both get heat,2
153925,the plants get hot and it helps something,2
153926,No because the heat from the sun is hitting the plants and in solar ovens the heat is forming inside.,2
153927,no because a solar oven needs boyloing water and 2 it needs water,2
153928,My first reason is the solar oven will absorb the suns heat to cook and the heat will most likely stay inside like he green house. Another reason is because both oven and the greenhouse absorbs the sun's heat.,4
153929,both are similar because they let in energy and let out cool air.,4
153930,"1. They have heat.
2.They have temperature changes.",2
153931,its like the same because an oven is like a box with heat and the picture is like a big oven that gets heat by the sun,2
153932,Theiri ar,1
153933,They are both similar because they have sunlight and panels and they help the plants.,4
153935,They are both related because both of them are generating heat and getting hotter ad hotter quickly.,3
153936,picture b,2
154112,A is similar to a solar oven because it is getting sun. Another reason is because it reflects off the greenhouse to make it a solar oven.,2
154118,they both keep in heat.,3
154119,"First, solar ovens need sunlight to produce energy and Picture B is doing that. Lastly, some of the heat escapes but in picture A the heat doesn't escape.",4
154122,Cause of all the energy hat enters and also the bounce around and travel,3
154124,Niether are similar because it has nothing to do with a solar oven,2
154127,Both have something that acts like the glass. Also both have something being heated up.,2
154128,The glass is like the cardboard because it lets the heat in but not out.,3
154130,it A because it has glass and it heats up.,2
154132,picture a is simular because the house is like an oven heating up from the sun and its giving people heat.,2
154134,"I said they both are similar because it shows in both pictures the sun rays going inside heating up the atmosphere, then coming back out, affecting the temperature.",4
154135,They are both similar because they are both keeping the sun rays inside and not getting out of the Atmosphere and they are giving out the sun rays to what is inside there terrrain,5
154141,Both have a somewhat glass around it. Both let the sun go in and traps it.,4
154143,that it s a solar panel and it is also a heat sencer .And it is a heat magic,2
154145,The sun gives warmth to the plants so they an grow through the top. and also the  it makes the plants grow.,2
154146,Yes they are similar because they both involve the sun but the Earth gets more sun than the glass because so that means that the earth gets more sun than the green house. So the earth gets more sun than the green house.,3
154147,Picture B is like a solar oven because the sun goes in and then it doesnt get out.,3
154148,"First they both show sun rays bouncing off something, and second they show keeping the heat rays.",5
154150,one reason is that they have plants and the last reason is that sun is going to the plants,2
154152,because it looks like one and the heat is going in the greenhouse like the heat goes in the oven,2
154153,Because in the solar oven the heat goes away.,2
154157,I think  both because the heat is inside and it sometimes gets out on picture B and on picture A it stays in.,4
154160,"One reason is that both the sun is going inside of the greenhouse and the earth,the other reason is it stays in.",4
154162,they both reflect the sun and then it leaves,3
154193,"1. The green house acts like the atmosphere like it keeps the sun inside
2. The amosphere keeps the heat inide.",3
154194,"In the solar oven you would need the same effect, letting energy in but not letting it escape. The solar oven is also made of man made materials and is working very similar to the green house.",4
154195,One reason to show why they are similar is that they both use the Greenhouse Effect takes place in both of them. Another reason is that they both have the correct enviornment for the Greenhouse Effect to take place.,3
154196,Because the solar ovens use the sun to cook food.,2
154197,The heat is bouncing of the plants and Earth and a solar oven has heat bounce of the sides.,2
154198,the atmosphere traps the heat and tries to get out. the atmosphere traps the heat to power up the oven,3
154199,Picture A is similar because it is giving heat to the plants inside and the heat is coming in and then it leaves.,2
154200,A it more like the solar oven because it hits something in order to heat up another thing also the heat does escape.,2
154201,B is the sun and the oven is related to the sun in heat,2
154202,They both show light coming to an area and less escaping.,5
154205,The pictures A and B because both of them involve sunlight hitting the surface of the object.,4
154206,"1- heat bounces of both off both of them
2-both the earth and the plants become warmer",3
154207,"Picture A is similar because it shows how the heat gets inside the greenhouse, and it also shows that the heat cant get out.",3
154208,Solar ovens keep in heat from the sun and Infared Radiation to create heat to warm up food.,4
154210,"One Reason is that the heat gets trapped inside the box, the greenhouse, and the atmosphere. My Second reason is that once trapped inside it bounces around freely.",4
154211,"They both trap heat in the space. Second, they both get very hot.",4
154212,i think this because the heat is going to be bouncing from the card board box. It also will be projecting of the sides.,2
154214,picture a is similar because the suns rays hit the solar oven like it hits the green house. another way its similar is it heats up the inside of the object and provides the amount of heat.,3
154215,because it has a planet earth,2
154216,B because it shows the atmosphere. The atmosphere gets the air.,2
154218,well picture b helps show how the sun earth and evaporation form a solar oven. And the sun helps the solar oven heat up.,2
154220,i dont know,1
154221,they are both similar because the sun and heat both effect the change of a and b.,3
154224,Neither are because they do not look similar.,2
154226,In picture A it shows it getting sun from the sun. In picture B it shows the sun giving energy to earth.,3
154228,because it gives examples of solar oven.,2
154307,I think B because in the picture it shows that the sun is making the plants evaporating so it will grow.,2
154318,i think they are similar because they both have sun,3
154319,One reason is that the glass heats up the box and greenhouse the same and for the second reason is that both the solar over and greenhouse are meant to keep the hot air inside.,4
154321,Picture A is similar because a solar oven keeps in the heat but some will go out and the most of the heat will stay in the solar oven just like the greenhouse.,3
154322,my 2 reasons are that they are both elated to the sun and that they both have something to do with plants and sun getting absorbed into them.,3
154323,they both generate heat. the bot take light energyy,4
154324,They both are trying to heat something up and they involve the sun or solar power.,3
154325,A solar oven keeps in heat and also is kept warm by the sun.,3
154326,the ovens will have tin foil the earth has the Atmosphere and the green house has the glass panels.,2
154327,the hot air goes in but never comes out,3
154329,a is simalar because it looks more of an solar oven by the house reflcting with the sun,2
154330,"because , it looks like its heating the plants. Like a solar over would heat up with sunlight.",3
154335,The heat is trapped in the house like and oven.,3
154336,becues they both have soliar stymes they both hve sun,2
154337,Which one of the structures are heat up the most. You are comparing the differences of the to objects that are being observed,2
154342,I think picture a because solar ovens are closed and have a top so does the small greenhouse.Another reason is the greenhouse can build u heat easy with just a insuated outside,2
154343,i think its A because 1 the rays hit the plantss and go inside the little hut thing,3
154345,One reason is that the arrows show how the hat gets in. And a greenhouse keeps heat in,3
154353,"the sun is foing into thr erth 
the sun is shineing on the green house",2
154371,Becouse they need heat and that needs heat to.,2
154514,we are the tomatoes and are atmosphere is here protecting us from the sun's rays untill we grow bigger. The panel,3
154155,"the heat goes through, and how it saves the heat",2
154151,no,1
153824,One reason why they are similar to each other is that they both keep in heat. The atmosphere and glass keep in heat like the plastic wrap does in the solar oven. They are also similar because both take in heat and don't let much out.,4
153822,Picture b is similar because the sun is going onto or into the earth and producing heat. This is what a solar oven does because light goes into the oven and heats u the oven.,3
153844,Both of them seem similar because in picture A it showed the glass trapping the heat and it being closed and exposed to the heat and in picture B because it shows when the heat is hitting the oven.,4
153852,"They are both similar because if a light hits them, the light will bounce off. And another reason is that Earth needs light and a solar oven needs light too.",4
153838,There both simlar because it shows the same piture but in just differt areas an place,3
155053,They are both similar  because they both trap and contain heat like a solar oven.,4
153831,The atmosphere and the roof of the greenhouse both reflect the heat. Second they both use radiation just like the ovens will.,4
153816,Solar oven uses greenhouse effect,2
153823,Both are not similar because the earth collects the suns energy and so does the green house not like a solar oven.,4
153837,It's similar because for the solar oven some radiation goes into the oven and some bounce off. Another reason is that they both are close to the source of heat.,4
153864,they are similar because the both are using solar power and both have something that is transferring light into heat.,4
153923,I chose both because the plastic wrap i like the atmosphere an the glass.,3
153928,"They are both similar because like the solar oven they use the suns as the radiation. They both have some type of greenhouse effect with the glass, atmosphere or even plastic wrap. They also have the suns radiation either absorbed or reflected when it come n the barrier like glass, atmosphere and plastics wrap or plexiglass.",4
153909,They are both similar because they are both pretty much doing the same thing except on a bigger and smaller scale.The solar oven traps in the sun radiation without letting most sun rays reflect back the pictures A and B do this too.,5
153913,Because the both reflect to another.,3
153917,these are the same thing,2
153916,"A solar oven would have some type of clear cover over it to let sun rays in and out. In picture B, the clear cover is the atmosphere. Also, in both a solar oven and the earth, some of the light reflects back.",3
153935,Both re similar because each of them show were the light is coming from and were it's hitting.,4
153922,the greenhouse is like a oven and it shows that heat is coming i and it is getting trapped,3
153921,"1. Heat is coming in and getting trapped.
2. The heat is heating up the pants just like the heat was heating up the inside of the solar oven.",3
153911,"1:The Light sometimes goes inside the Solar oven and some bounces off
2:and also the sun rays warm up earth and the light warms up box",3
153930,1.The heat reflects off of both. 2. Cold air goes out off both when the hot air goes in.,3
154112,Picture B has the atmosphere sorta as the cover then the sun which acts like the light. Picture A has the glass panels as the cover then he sun shines and goes through.,3
153926,Yes they are like a solar oven because the sun goes through the plastic rap (you put it on your oven to keep the heat in) and then it stays inside because the atmosphere keeps the heat inside and then when the heat comes through the glass it stays inside.,4
153908,Both are similar because they are showing how the light reflects inside the space. Another reason is that both spaces like a solar oven have electricity bouncing in the space/area.,4
153905,"It shows how the heat will rise the oven's temperature and how the heat will exit. It also models the roles that some of the materials will play, like the plastic wrap compared to the glass for a greenhouse of the atmosphere.",2
153918,no because it depends on what materials you use and if you get something that can reflect light,3
153906,"Its like the same idea of an oven.
We used something to cover the box/oven",2
153919,I think they are a little similar because the glass and atmosphere are acting like the plastic wrap or plexiglass and letting radiation in. Another reason I think it is similar is because the sun is being the radiation for both of the pictres like a solar oven would use radiation.,4
153914,"One reason that both picyurs are similar to a solar oven is they are using the sun for the energy. Another reason is when the light shines throught, it heats up the space inside, just like a soar oven",4
153927,they are similar because they atratca heat,2
154135,they are both simaler because they are both reflecting the heat back at what is below them and everyything in it,3
154124,"Both pictures are similar because the atmosphere in the Earth picture could be the covering of the box in our solar oven. In the greenhouse, the glass is the covering.",3
154132,Because they both are trapping heat and they both have a source of heat.,4
154162,"they both reflect sun rays, they also both collect the suns heat.",4
154134,"They are both like solar ovens because they both use the sun's natural heat energy to affect the inside temperature, and the both use radiation, convection, and conduction to affect the inside temperature.",4
154153,"They don't look like
And they don't work the same.",2
154118,they both let sun come through and keep heat in. they both heat up whats inside them.,4
154155,"both are similar because they both retain like a solar oven
also , radiaton goes in and turns inito heat.",4
154119,The sunlight is coming into the inside of either the Earth or the garden and the top traps the heat. They both use the sun as their energy source.,5
154130,they are both similar beause it using the atmospere,3
154150,one reason is that the green house would absorb the heat and the heat of the sun wouldn't  leave the green house. the second reason is that it would cause radiation so the green house has sunlight for the plants to grow.,4
154122,In the Picture at Part B. it shows the heat from the sun entering the atmosphere like a solar oven and at Part A. it shows the heat entering the greenhouse.,2
154127,They are similar because in both the pictures and the solar ovens there is something that lets in the energy and something that gets heated.,4
154143,one reason is that A has solar pannel and second reason is that it is kinda like a box,2
154128,They are both similar to a solar oven because a solar oven should have a clear cover that traps heat in and both pictures have and show that.,4
154141,Both of them are like a solar oven because they are both using a system of light and there is a way to trap the energy from the sun inside. The solar ovens are the same because you have  light and you can have Plexiglas on the box just like the panels and atmosphere.,5
154145,They are both similar because they are both showing the atmosphere surrounding the earth and the radiation going into the greenhouse. Another fact could be the radiation reflects on the earth and plants.,4
154208,They both tap radiation to create heat. They both have a type of cover.,5
154202,The solar oven is meant to trap heat. A greenhouse and the atmosphere work the same way.,4
154193,The two pictures keep the heat in but it doset let it out. Now the second reason is that the plants or earth always get the heat.,3
154200,Picture a is more similar to the solar oven because has different materials and picture b is naturally there,2
154206,"In the solar oven if you use plastic wrap it will act the same as the atmosphere and glass. Both pictures include conduction, radiation, ad convection like a solar oven",3
154212,because they both have something to keep all the air in and they are both trying to keep air in something.,2
154214,"because all have the reflection items like the atmosphere, glass, and plastic wrap. and all use conduction, convection and radiation to heat up whats ever inside.",3
154218,well they both have the same reasons and it shows how it works and like maybe an example of something.,2
154221,"One reason they're alike is because they both have an opening for the inside.
Another reason they're similar is because the pictures both have the same sunlight purpose.",4
154226,picture A because the sun's light goes to the green house and the plants get the energy.,3
154217,the sun is sunny,2
154199,One reason is that the green house is like a solar oven because the glass like in a solar oven goes through and heats up what is inside.Reason two is because the atmosphere is like the plastic wrap to it and it heats up the earth and like in a solar oven it heats up what ever is inside.,3
154198,The a picture shows no reflection and heat wont stay in.,2
154215,"First beacause it doesnt have to do with a box or plexiglas , or aluminal flap, plastic wrap, construction paper , or tinfoil.
Second because your not using plants.",2
154196,A similiar because the heat goes in and creates heat also it is similiar because they both use heat to heat up something.,2
154201,They get heat from the sun and has something that will cover the inside.,3
154205,When we tested are solar ovens are ovens did not absorb all of the heat because it depended about everything you put inside and outside.,2
154197,Yes because the heat is being reflected and the earth and plants are being hit by the light.,3
154204,Picture A and B are like because you are still using the sun for both things.,3
154195,The sun's heat enters a space and can not leave in all three pictures. The heat energy reacts by heating up the area its contained in.,4
154311,the eart looks like the glass or plastic wrape and the atmaphear look like th tin foil.,2
154322,"One reason is that the glass of the greenhouse is like the cardboard of the box and the plants are the food that is cooking, and the atmosphere of picture B is like the cardboard and the earth is the food that is cooking. The second reason is that the glass in pic A and the atmosphere of pic B is surrounding whatever is in the inside just like a oven.",2
154310,It show how both pictures show how it simalur to a solar oven because it shows how the heat goes in the solor oven and how it absorves and some reflect.,4
154327,B because it shows the hot air going in ad having trouble going out.,3
154326,the plastic wrap or Plexiglas acts like the glass panel and atmosphere.,3
154324,"Picture A is cooking/incubating something and it uses radiation, convention, and conduction.",2
154319,"My first reason is that the protection layer (Glass and Atmosphere) is keeing heat inside heating up the earth and my second reason is that they both have convection, conduction, and radiation.",4
154343,the solar oven needs to keep heat inside but if it dosnt it really cant be called a oven if it cant heat any thing up,2
154307,They are both similar because part A shows that the light is going in the plant and that happens in a solar oven. Part B is because that shows that the light is reflecting off of the plant and that also happens in a solar oven.,4
154371,because they both let in ligth and both dont let it out.,5
154353,they are  different  because the  sun is in different placess,3
154336,becuse how the sun hits the roof or beacus how the heats goes in,2
154325,"Two reasons they both are similar to a solar oven is because, a solar oven traps heat inside the oven, not letting it out, just like a greenhouse and Earth's greenhouse effect. It also works like a real oven only it uses the Sun's or other items that include light, the greenhouses and Earth's greenhouse effect, which use the Sun's energy as well.",5
154329,B because it looks like the heat that was transferred from the sun to earth.,2
154323,"both atract heat, both have to have a clear roof",3
154345,Some heat is going and staying in,3
154703,the plants inside are like the food,2
155334,"1: the heat goes in and makes the ovens; houses temperture go up. 
2: it makes the temperture of the food go hotter and hotter until the food get s to the right heat.",2
153836,"Both have an atmosphere"" like an oven would  letting in heat and reflecting out solar radiation. Both also I can see are letting out some heat  like a piece of plexiglas or plastic wrap would on a solar oven.""",4
153834,"Both are similar because the glass as as an atmosphere on the solar oven as shown on both pictures. They are also similar because the glass atmosphere"" reflects into the box as shown in the pictures.""",3
153863,"They are similar to a solar oven because they both show radiation, conduction, and convection.",2
153843,because the heat comes in but it is not coming out of throw the top of the box/greenhouse,3
153826,Picture A shows the sunlight passing through the glass and hitting the plants. In picture B it shows the sunlight hitting the earth.,3
153848,"In my solar oven I used the plexiglas so, the glass and the atmosphere is the plexiglas. The plants and the Earth is the item inside our solar oven.",2
153835,"Picture A and B are similar to a solar oven because the heat can reflect off the oven ,but still get trapped in. A solar oven is also similar to Picure A and B because when you are using a solar oven, you can use materials to make the heat reflect into the oven just like how the heat reflects off of the earth and green house , but still stays on earth or the greenhouse.",4
153860,Two reasons are that it has panels to attract the sunlight and solar ovens have black paper to attract sunlight. Another reason would be that it is sealed so that only the radiation from the sun comes in and a solar oven uses plastic wrap to trap the energy.,4
153830,"The solar oven would have a cover like the glass and atmosphere. Some cover materials could be either Plexiglas or plastic wrap. If we used plastic wrap as an example, the heat will pass through the plastic wrap and keep bouncing off the plastic wrap so the heat can stay inside the solar oven just like heat stays inside the Earth and the greenhouse.",4
154514,because they both have shields like the plexiglass the earth Atmosphere and the gardens green house glass and the plexiglass of a solar oven.,3
153859,because it traps heat and it worms  thins up,3
153832,The one in a is liike a solar ovn becuse it uses glass and dark interior. B is like a solar oven because he earth is the thermonitor the sun is the light and the Atmoshere is the plexiglass,3
153854,It shows how the earth acts like the plexiglass by collecting all of the heat. Also the heat shows how some of the heat bounces out but the heat bounces off of the   atmosphere and black it the box just like our solar ovens do.,2
153839,They are both similar because they both give off heat and keep everything warm inside the greenhouse just like the sun traps in the heat inside the solar oven. Also it helps heat up the oven and the sun helps heat both up.,4
153818,"They are both like a solar oven because they both heat up using energy from the sun.
They both contain all the parts: A closed container, a clear roof, etc.",4
153915,because it has glass,2
153925,one is the sun bounses off the earth and the secoud reason is it is heating up by the sun.,2
153912,Because picture A is like a box and it conserves heat.,2
153924,well it is the same because the both keep heat in like the soler oven,4
153936,A is similar because is in the house,2
154148,"Because they are both using radiation to heat something  up.
And they both have similar things with it bouncing off.",4
154152,Because it looks like they both get a lot of heat,2
154160,Picture A is similar because the heat is going inside the greenhouse and it has glass so it can be like plexyglass.,2
154157,Picture B looks like a solar oven because if you use tin foil it will reflect to the sun,2
154147,They both work the same because both of them trap energy.,5
154159,"1.it attacts sun light.
2.and keeps it there",3
154161,"The 1st reason is that the picture A. shows that the greenhouse is getting sun from windows. 
The and reason is that if so you look at the picture A. it shows that the window is letting the sun is getting transparent so the plant can get sun and live.",2
154146,well yes kinda because they are reflecing to the oven so ya I think they are similar because of that.,2
154211,"First, it's similar by having the inside heat up and doesn't get out and secondly, they are similar because they are both a way of heating something up.",3
154210,One reason is the glass of the greenhouse and the atmosphere both absorb and reflect. The second is that both the green house and the atmosphere warm up a thing like the earth or the plants.,3
154318,yes because the greenhouse is like a solar oven because it is like a box and it has glass on top of it,2
149950,The picture is the same as a solar oven because it gets heat and it takes out the cold air.,2
149966,"Both are similar because as I saw in the solar oven simulator before, it kept in most of the heat.",4
149972,"It is easier for heat to enter in the figures, and a solar oven.  It is also harder for heat to escape in the pictures and a solar oven than it is to enter",3
149953,I gave that answer because in the picture it shows The heat going in and leaving. Also because it shows the atmosphere keeping the heat inside.,3
149970,the energy is trapped inside like an oven.,4
149590,it is the solar oven because they both have sun,3
149956,Your heating it so it would get hot both in the green house and and for the solar oven.,2
149961,they are bigger,2
,,1
149588,"One reason is that on picture B, if reflects off and goes up and down. Another reason is that picture A is reflecting and it will change overtime depending on the weather.",2
149955,I think this because heat is inside and it is big.,2
149967,it has efect to the glass also it pushes through and it is a big glass ball,2
150648,The are similair because the both bring heat to the area and because they all are like a shell.,3
149965,Sunlight is coming through glass and the heat is coming.,3
149954,it just doesnt seem the same but it does heat properly like it did with ovens,2
149962,they all use the sun,3
149969,The heat that went into the box stayed there and the heat bounces off the box like the other to pictures show us.,3
149971,i chose it,1
150065,They both let sun rays in and trap the hat inside.,5
150066,Well... I don't really know what a solar oven is. So maybe the heat from the sun is going through the glass and giving the plants heat. So that might be a solar oven.,2
150074,The are both like the earth and are both transferring heat waves.,3
150076,I think the pictures for both A and B are alike to a solar oven because they both have heat coming in. Another reason would be that that both heat awre trying to escape.,3
150073,A solar oven traps in heat like the pictures and they are all powered by the sun,4
150078,Picture B reminds me of an oven because when it get hot the heat gets trapped inside,3
150070,because they both have something to keep the heat in,3
150072,I chose Yes So in Picture A  in picture B the same thing is happening but without the shelter or the plants.,3
150075,They are similar to a solar oven because they both let heat in but not out.,4
150077,Pictures A and B are similar to a solar oven because the heat goes inside and some heat goes out like a convection current.,4
150069,"picture B is similar because in the solar oven, it showed yellow thing raining from the sky and",2
151162,"Yes.Because the sun was giving energy to the plants,there were also a lot of electrical lights attached to the plants, that is how the plants are getting there energy.",3
150052,My first reason is because they both grow plants and my second reason is that they both need sun light.,3
150067,because it has yellow arrows,2
150063,Both A and B both show the heat not being able to escape and both pictures only show the light entering.,5
150056,Picture B is similar because in a solar oven the heat gets trapped inside it then when you open it the heat goes out. In picture B it looks like the sun's heat goes into the earth then it gets released.,3
150061,I chose picture A because the picture shows how the greenhouse traps in the heat just like the solar oven. Also the greenhouse lets out some heat like the oven.,3
150059,one it is like a solar oven.second it looks like one to.,2
150062,They are both similar because they have sunlight going into the greenhouse and earth. Also they both have sunlight reflecting back out from the glass.,4
150064,In picture B all the things go everywhere so its like an oven.,2
150079,Is because picture B is realize the hat back in to the atmosphere and the heat is coming back because it gets cold. Another reason why is because the eath is like a big giant greenhouse.,2
150053,because they all keep the heat in side.,4
150054,They are both similar because from the solar oven simulation all the heat was bouncing around.,2
150055,yes the picture A is similar because it almost have some of the thing that the picture B haves .,2
150058,similar beceoue b have the sun,3
150060,Both diagrams remind me of a solar oven and their descriptions.,3
150071,"Picture B because it shows how the sun flashes onto the earth, and it shows what it is like around the earth.",2
150057,It is showing heat and energy coming in and out of the atmosphere. Also cold air seems to be going up.,3
150085,"Pictures A"" and ""B"" are similar because they both show the sunlight/radiation entering the air or atmosphere. They also both show heat bouncing back of the object the sunlight is hitting.""",4
150087,One reason I picked Yes,2
150104,in picture a the heat is being captured because the glass prevents the heat from escaping in picture b the same is happening as in picture a,3
150101,Picture A is similar because in a solar oven the heat inside the greenhouse is similar to a solar oven inside.,2
150105,"I think they are both similar because it heats up inside by the sunlight.  Another reason is because the sunlight is aloud to go in, changing the temperature.",4
150109,The reason why I choose letter A because it looks the same. It works the same way like how a solar oven works it goes in through the windows and stays there for a period of time.,2
150086,because it is right,1
150097,A is similar to b because heat is going trough and reaching the tomatoes. A is also similar to be because its both atrackting heat.,2
150114,1. ti macks the sun that is the energy,3
150094,matt,1
150082,They are similar because they both have heat going in them.,3
150090,because they both keep air in and dont let it out.,3
150092,because that is solar energy.,3
150113,because what i told you,1
150111,because they are both the same,3
150112,IT acts like a giant oven and it has a window.,2
150096,B because the picturt show the sun heating the earth andthe air releing,2
150132,I picked Yes so that is why they are related. They also use the sun for all three of them.,2
150133,Picture A is similar because it shows the sun beaming down on a window or solar panel which makes it heat up.,2
150130,1. The atmosphere is like  pane of glass the stops the heat from escaping,3
,,1
,,1
150127,"Picture A is similar to the solar oven because both have heat going into the a certain space, and the heat spreads throughout the space.",2
150117,"Yes, picture A is similar to a solar oven because the sun goes through the glass then the heat stays inside of it. It would not escape. that is why they are similar to each other.",3
150115,Sun and moon,1
150124,They are similar because they  both trap heat in them a solar oven traps heat and the atmosphere and greenhouses trap heat inside of them. Another reason is that they both use the sun for warmth>.,4
150131,"First, picture A is a box like container with transparent panels to let the heat come through, like a solar oven. Second, picture B is contained by the atmosphere and the Earth is what is inside collecting all the heat, like a solar oven.",2
150134,Picture a is similar because it is in a small box.,2
150145,the sun is heating up the earth and it can't get out to space. Also the sun is heating the plants up and its the same.Another thing is that its ios not only hitting the plants but other stuff around it.,3
150137,I said that A is more like an oven because it has glass and also keeps the heat in like the green house.,3
150149,"Solar ovens are closed up just like a greenhouse so heat gets trapped inside and can't get out. Also, the heat that doesn't get inside the greenhouse or solar oven, it reflects off the outer surface.",3
150140,It shows an example of plants in a greenhouse that collect solar radiation to grow. Picture B only shows the infrared radiation and the solar radiation from the Sun to Earth and back.,3
150122,"I chose that both are similar to a solar over because, first of all both of the pictures are both an example of the greenhouse effect so that make them similar, and finally they are both similar to a solar over because they both have to dpo with trapping heat and they change whatever is inside of it warm or hot.",4
150123,"Yes, they are both similar because the solar oven traps heat in, like the glass or the atmosphere and they all attract heat.",4
150138,In B the sun is hiting the earth.,2
,,1
150136,The sun is beating down into the greenhouse and being transferred back.,2
150142,one reason is that they can is the plants grow,2
150125,They are similar because the energy is both coming from the sun and both trap the energy in a space around them.,4
150116,It uses a greenhouse for the example whitch is like a solar oven. It does not let sun light escape.,4
150148,because they both attract heat,3
150128,b is similar because the atmosphere acts like heat absorbant material. a is similar because the greenhouse roof acts like heat absorbant material.,2
150144,"A is a greenhouse, the atmosphere is a solar oven, and the atmosphere traps heat",3
150516,They are both similar because heat is going into them.,3
150143,This is because something hot is shinning on the greenhouse making it hotter and something hot is shinning on the earth making it hotter.,2
150146,A and B are similar to the solar oven because they both collect heat.Also they are similar because they store the heat inside.,3
150195,I chose this answer because in a greenhouse the plants get mostie from the trapped in heat. And because the solar oven traps in heat just like a greenhouse.,3
150200,My 1st reason is that it show how they get trapped and my 2nd reason is how they are bouncing everywhere.,3
150198,The reason I think that si beacuse both work yet one is slower that the other.,2
150158,Because they used the sun and,2
150159,They both are similar to a solar oven. It both has the sun shining on it. They also have the glass to keep heat in.,4
150153,the heat goes in through the glass roof heating up the inside,2
150162,?,1
150173,They are kind of similar because there is both sunlight and light is bouncing of thing.,3
150164,They both keep energy in something. They both help greenery.,4
150178,I choose this answer because the arrows go out and in the box.,2
150176,"One, the heat is shown to get in the greenhouse and atmosphere, and two, it also shown to bounce back or escape.",2
150166,Picture a is simallar becuse its closed like the oven.,2
150160,"I chose that both are similar because all 3 [Greenhouse,Earth and Solar Oven]keep heat inside of them.",3
150155,picture  A because it literally has a greenhouse sunroof,2
150172,I think this because they both show where the radition is happing,3
150163,they are similar because they both don't let go of heat,3
150157,they are both getting lots of heat help it grow,2
150174,It looks like a solar oven because it is very light and bright.,2
150154,They are both similar to the solar oven because the sun just goes right through the glass and the solar oven.,3
150167,Picture A uses the sun to heat up and make heat in the house.,2
150194,They are because they are trapping heat inside themselves. Another reason is that they both are kind of mad to trap,4
150168,Two reasons why I chose the answer Yes,2
150170,i think the greenhouse because it traps heat and the earth does not trap heat it blows off by the wind.,3
150199,I choose B because the oven uses the sun for it and so dose the green house.,2
150196,w,1
150156,sajkv,1
150243,"I think it is like a solar oven because they trap hot air, and release cold air.",3
150204,They both are similar because they bothe trap the heat in so it can't escape.Another reason is they both use the heat and light to keep things warm.,5
150244,Picture A is similar because a solar oven has its heat bouncing all around and that's what the picture A is showing.,2
150219,"I chose that both were similar. I chose this because the sun heats up a solar oven, as it does for the earth and a greenhouse. I also chose this because the pictures and a solar oven use sunlight.",4
150231,my two answere are that because i think it is verry simmeler.,2
150236,"Yes both are because they both attract the sun, and keeps it in there.",4
150246,I think both because picture a shows that it projects onto the plants.Picture B shows how it goes in circles like convection currents.,3
150240,"Both are similar because solar ovens trap sunlight. The atmosphere captures sunlight for Earth, and a greenhouse captures sunlight to help plants grow.",5
150242,"Picture B is more like a solar oven because it shows how the sun is shining through the roof. The picture then show the sun going through the roof, and some of it bouncing out.",2
150218,the sun is going in to both of them and both of them let the hot air go,2
150226,Its similar because there is solar and uses sun to heat it up,2
150208,They are similar to a solar oven because the inside is slowly heating up and there are rays going in and out and it is transferring heat.,3
150235,"They are similar because the ovens trap in the heat and don't let it escape. Also, they both use sunlight to do the things they were made for.",5
150220,Both are similar to a solar oven because they all keep the heat from escaping.,4
150228,it is making the place hotter inside so it can be hotter and it is letting the sun go inside the green house,2
150223,One reason is because they both trap heat and don't let it escape like a solar oven.Another reason why they are alike is because they are both meant to keep in heat and not let is go so we don't freeze.,4
150205,1.i pick yes it is the both because the sun is giving sunlight.,3
150230,yes because both of them are heating up an object.,3
150249,The picture shows the sun's light the reflects on the lithosphere.,3
150203,They are both are trapping heat.,4
150248,I think this because they both have the same details.One more reason is that they both are helpful.,3
150237,both have heat coming in and out,3
150241,One reason was because a solar oven needs light like a greenhouse does to make something. The second reason was because I think the greenhouse relates more to the awnser I chose was because the solar oven and the greenhouse both need sun.,3
150221,They are both the same because like a solar oven they collect heat from the sun and they all keep the heat in a certain place.,4
150206,well it is covered ,2
,,1
,,1
150247,because its keeping light and heat inside.,4
150215,1. the sun is ponting to the green house ,2
,,1
150239,both bring in heat into the earth and into the greenhouse.,2
150207,The pictures are similar because the objects are trying to absorb the radiation.,4
150238,"The inside on picture A is showing the heat go in but not going out, same like a solar oven.",3
150214,I think the earth because it dose not let air out.,2
150202,"B is because it is inside, it is protecting it and it is heat and cold resistant.",2
149590,picture a is similar because it has the heat is going through the glass like our solar oven.Also the heat is transfering.,2
150648,they are both simiar because they both get heat from the sun and because they both have some type of shell around them.,3
149953,I think both because the glass or atmosphere could be plastic wrap or plexiglass. Also because the it gets hot inside.,4
150071,"Picture A is a diagram of the house, also picture A shows how the heat goes through the glass.",2
151162,There are sunlight and electricity.,3
150067,because the sun shines through the roof and heats it up and also the sun on the earth is like the lite on the solar oven,3
150134,"Picture a is similar because it is in a room and picture b isn't.Also, it absorbs the heat.",2
150123,The atmosphere and glass is the same as the tin foil because it bounces the heat back to the box. The solar oven and picture a and b are the same because they keep heat in.,4
150128,"They are both similar because they both show heat entering an area but being unable to escape, and they both show how convection can heat an area up.",4
150136,"Because the heat is bouncing back up into the window, although it's trapped. And another reason is because hot air from the sun is being lurched back and forth.",3
150122,They are both similar to a solar oven because it uses the sun's rays for heat and traps them inside. Because of the heat trapped inside it warms up the stuff inside.,5
150135,Picture A is like a soler oven because the picture if the green house is getting all the heat .,2
150231,one because it is showing ul all there is and two beacuse shows there envirment.,2
150247,because instead of heating its lighting up,3
,,1
150215,one thay both reflect two thay invol the sun.,2
149959,because the glass panals are like plexiglass and the sun rays are shining through the glass windows,2
149970,"The radiation gets in, heats up and is trapped.",4
149967,the have sun light in the room and it keeps the heat in the room for the plants,4
149957,"yes,because the glass is basically like the plexiglass(well of course plexi glass is clear plastic and glass is also clear),and the light goes inside and heat the insides up like the oven.",4
149961,it is bigger and it uses the sun.,2
149954,they both heat up something in earth.,2
150073,They both trap the sunlight and they both  use the sun to heat the inside,5
150078,None of them are similar because they don't use the sun power the same way.,2
150077,"Picture B is similar to a solar oven because there are arrows that come from the sun, then bounce off Earth's surface. The dotted line circling the Earth is the radiation going through the dotted line..",3
150062,Both are similar because a solar oven makes the sun go inwards than outwards. And both pictures show that.,2
150076,"I think both pictures are similar to the solar oven because they both absorb heat from the sun and reflects the heat, also.",3
150130,The glass holds in heat and the atmosphere hold in the heat also.,3
150115,Because it shows how the heat goes through the glass which is like plexiglas.,3
150149,Picture B shows that heat is going into earth but trying to come back out but gets trapped by the atmosphere. Picture A shows that heat is going straight through the glass and going into the room. These both occur in a solar oven.,4
150125,"I think a solar oven is similar to these things because one, the glass and atmosphere are like plexiglass or plastic wrap. Two, these things all use the sun.",4
150124,They both are similar because the trap the gases and heat it up.,3
150177,It is more detailed and helps understand more,2
150178,"Yes, the two pictures are like the solar oven because the sunlight goes through the box like the green house and the heat goes in the box.",4
150198,"In some ways they are simualar to a solar oven.One way would be that with picture A"" it shows that sun is going into the greenhouse like a solar oven would to.""",2
150175,well picture a is like an solar oven because the room is like the inside of the box and the glass is what was heating it up and its like the tinfoil and stuff in solar oven.,3
150161,It shows how it kind of works like a real solar oven.,2
150196,it a aracks heat,2
150202,Both because they can be different and the same.,2
150172,I think this because the earth is doing the same thing the house did,2
150226,One reason is that the greenhouse uses sun to keep the plants growing. Another reason is that the greenhouse doesn't get that hot.,2
150204,"I think both are similar because all three things heat something up and show conduction,convection, and radiation.Another reason is all three things let heat in but then it can't get out so it is trapped.",4
150223,They are both similar because they both take in heat and lets the sun go so it heats up whatever's inside of /on earth or the greenhouse.One other reason why they are like a solar oven is because they both heat something up on the inside like how for earth it haets up the water and the people living on the earth and the greenhouse takes in the heat to heat up some plants and the solar oven heats up whatever is inside the oven.Those ar4e my two reasons why I think they are alike.,3
150145,the both dont want to let the heat from going anywhere.,3
,,1
149968,They are both similar because the sun is heating up the in side of the layers. Another reason is because they both have something in side.,3
149966,"1. One of the reasons is that the atmosphere bounces the sunrays back like a solar oven bounces the heat back inside.
2. The greenhouse is trying to stay the right temperature, or hotter, for the plants, like the solar oven tries to stay hot for a long period of time.",3
149963,"Yes, both A and B are similar to a solar oven because a solar oven conducts heat from the sun, also like A and B. Also, A and B and the solar oven all trap some of the heat coming from the sun, and that heats up whatever is inside.",4
149586,Its because the green is catching the heat and putting it into the plants.,2
149958,They are all similar because they all have something to heat inside such as food and the all have something such as an atmosphere keeping the heat in.,4
149589,"Yes the sun enters through plexiglass, (the atmosphere) and is reflected off tin foil. (Earth)",3
149951,it shows in the picture and they both make heat,2
149588,"They are similar to a solar oven by the radiation, conduction, and convection are all in each one and on each one, something is heating up.",4
149956,The relfection from the sun is keeping it hot like the solar oven if something is going to melt you need heat. It also reflects from the greenhouse to the astompre which is still going to be hot.,2
149587,"Picture a and picture b are alike because they are both showing the greenhouse effect. This is like a solar oven because in a solar oven the heat comes in and then it is reflected from the aluminum foil onto the black paper When the heat comes in in the beginning, some of it is reflected and some stays.
Another reason is that they are all alike is because they all show radiation, convection, and conduction.",4
149962,"The sun/ lamp made the greenhouse hot, and the solar oven hot but not as hot.",2
149972,"The glass on a greenhouse, and the Earth's atmosphere trap heat like a solar oven would.  The Earth, and the things in the greenhouse absorb heat like the bottom of a solar oven.",4
149960,they both  act the same like a solar oven because they let in air and don't let it out.,4
150217,Both answers remind me of an solar oven because both are reflecting heat.,2
150065,They both let heat in and keep it in.,3
150079,One reason is because they both trap the heat.Another reason why is because  thety both are like a green house.,3
150061,I said they are both smilar because they show how some heat goes in and comes out like a solar oven.,2
150060,"A solar oven is similar to picture A because the greenhouse glass is letting sunlight into the greenhouse and trapping it inside. A solar oven is similar to picture B because, the atmosphere protects Earth's air and traps warmth inside of it. As you can see, they are both similar to a solar oven because they both have a outer layer that let's heat in and traps it inside.",5
150053,I said yes both are similar because with the solar oven if you had a tin foil flap it kept the heat in and that's what picture A and picture B do,3
150063,Picture A and B are like solar ovens because they both show light entering something and then some light not being able to escape.,4
150052,one reason is because they both let the light shine  to make it hot and because they both do the samething.,4
150074,"They both have a way of trapping heat to give heat to something, and the second reasons is that both have a heat source like the sun.",4
150055,yes they are because there both using the sun and there both using the same thing as the outside things .,2
150064,there is radiation ,3
,,1
150057,Both are similar because they both have things that have heat bouncing off it.  Both the Earth and the plants would be like the food in the solar oven.,3
150056,One reason that both pictures are similar to a solar oven is that the suns heat comes in then it gets let out. Another reason why both pictures are like a solar oven is they get heated inside from the sun.,3
150070,2 reasons why they are both simalar is because number one they both have a layer that acts as a barrier so the sunlight does not escape. And reason number two is because they both have something inside that is heating up because of the sun,5
150075,"Both are similar because they both warm up, and they heat up things that are inside of them.",3
150054,"Both are similar because in an oven something is cooking inside while heat is also bouncing around in it, the plants and the Earth are like the objects you are heating up, and the radiation gets trapped and bounces",5
150058,The soler oven sows the  heat in the haus giting hoter.,2
150111,because it reflects,2
150108,the secn  tima we got82,1
150082,"They are both like reflectors, and they both are attracting sun.",2
150083,I think that picture A is similar because the sun is shining on the greenhouse which is radiation and it it use's conduction  because the plants are touching the green house and it use's convection because the air in the greenhouse.,3
150127,"The greenhouse is like a solar oven because it has a top, clear roof and the sun reaching into the box. The greenhouse is also like a solar oven because it has the sun to heat up the inside.",3
150117,"I think they are both similar because in the greenhouse, the sun is reflecting into the glass to make it warm in there. B is also similar because the atmosphere is acting like glass, so the sun's reflection is bouncing off of it but the heat is going inside. Which makes Earth warm just like a solar oven.",4
150516,"Both a and b are similar to the solar oven because all of them are heating up and a,b and the solar oven have radiation conduction and convection.",3
150137,Well they are both similar because. Like on question 1 the earths atmosphere represents the glass of the green house which is similar to the solar oven because it has some sort of see through covering such as plastic wrap. Another reason is there goal is to get heat inside and  not let to much out.,5
150133,One reason why picture A is similar is because the heat is getting trapped in the glass which is like how heat gets trapped in a solar oven and allows it to heat up. Another reason why is because the air is heating up in the greenhouse just like how it would in a solar oven.,3
150118,the solar oven will be able to trap heat from the sun and will get at a hi tempurture.,3
150121,yes beacuse it shows the sun rays beaming down on the earth like a box. and the second reason is the atmosphere is like the plexi glass and the plastic wrap see through but protecting the earth or box.,4
150116,They both are like a oven because they keep the sun rays in. They also trap in heat.,5
150141,One reason is that you could use plastic wrap as the atmosphere  and the second reason is that it realises heat but all so traps some,4
150120,the green house keeps in sunlight like a solar oven,4
150132,"1. They both use some sort of material that prevents heat from escaping.
2. They both have a resemblance to one, and there is also glass and solar panels on the Earth.",4
150167,Both use the heat from the sun to heat the inside of both barriers.,3
150168,Why both of the pictures are both similar is because they both have the greenhouse effect and they work like a normal greenhouse would.,3
150158,Because you are heating The plant just like what is happenning To the mashmellow and they both are heating something,2
150173,Both is have sunlight go into them then some light bounce off.The solar oven is the same the light goes in and some bounces off.,4
150162,"Ill experiment with a box and picture A is a bilding. I also was talking about my struckture and not the radiation, convecton, or conduction.",2
150155,"they are both heating something up or helping something grow and they all use conduction,convection,and radiation.",4
150174,Because the heat is bouncing off the ground.,2
150156,because a uses the sun,2
150199,"Picture b is similer because when the sun goes down into your solar oven, some heat bounces off just like the sun beating down on our atmosphere.",2
150176,"In both pictures it is shown some sunlight gets in, some gets out, and some neither touch the earth or the greenhouse, in conclusion, both are very similar to a solar oven.",5
150235,"they are both somewhat like boxes or containers that:
1. trap sunlight with something that lets heat in, but not out.
2. use the heat they trap to heat things up.",5
150241,"The first reason is that a solar oven has radiation to make something heat up or grow. The second reason is that a solar oven is alike to a greenhouse because they both use the same elements radiation, conduction ,and convection.",3
150207,The pictures are both similar because they both are having sun reflect on them making it hotter.,3
150206,well it is like a box and it is covered and has a porpused.,2
150221,"Yes they both are similar to a solar oven because both pictures show something that is keeping the heat inside something and that is what happens in solar ovens.They are also similar because like a solar oven the heat bounces of something like the glass or the atmosphere and gets trapped in the box,greenhouse, or Earth.",4
150208,"They are both similar to a solar oven because they both have conduction, convection, and radiation heating up the earth and the greenhouse. Another reason why they are like a solar oven is because they both have something that is on the outside of the solar oven  acting like plastic wrap or plexi glass to heat the subjects up.",4
150246,No because there is not the came materials and theres no way for it to cook.,2
150244,One reason is that the heat is getting trapped in the house and gives heat.,3
150249,"They both are the same but look different, and The both have the sun.",3
150205,1 yes because they both getting heat as together.,2
,,1
155700,The reason I think picture A is similar to a solar oven is because the glass draw in heat and trap it. I don't think picture B is like a solar oven because the Atmosphere doesn't draw in the sun.,3
150228,they work the same but they just look different,2
150218,A is similar because it is supposed to trap the heat.,3
150242,"Picture a is similar because picture b only shows the,greenhouse effect that happens on earth."" While Picture A shows a real greenhouse where light passes through the house",3
150203,it enovoles heat being trapped and heat coming in.,3
150240,Both use sunlight to heat something up.,3
150248,They both have conduction.They both have plants.,2
150237,the first one is because it shows radiation and the fact that the glass keeps it out,3
150219,Both are similar to a solar oven because they both are heating up something. They are also both similar because they involve the sun.,3
150220,"The greenhouse and the earth both have radiation, conduction, and convection.
They also both have something that keeps the radiation.",5
150243,"They are both similar because one, they try to heat up something and two, because it traps like a solar oven is supposed to do so it heats up.",4
150230,The greenhouse is similar because the heat is being kept in and also because both are bouncing off something.,3
150222,In picture b it is simalar because the atmosphereis holding,2
150238,they both get heat inside of them and heat up everything.,2
,,1
150245,"A is similar to a solar oven because it is basically a bigger version of one, and B is like a solar oven except humongous and in space.",2
150214,They both are doing the same thing.,2
150239,They both have a top like plexiglass or plastic wrap but just the atmosphere and glass.,3
,,1
150236,Yes because they both are attracted by the sun and the heat bounces off and travels.,3
150201,I think they are the same because the heat is going threw the glass.,2
150197,They are both similar because the both trap heat in like plexi glass and they both catch heat and keep it there.,5
150163,because the solar oven was soppoes to get hot and the green house and the earths atmoshere,2
150159,They both heat up like solar ovens and warm up things like plants or earth.,3
150160,both act like a solar oven because when heat gets inside it cant leave,4
150165,Neither of them are because they don't have conduction or convection the two pictures only have radiation because the sun is beating on it.,3
150154,They are both similar because the both are reflecting off of the sun and also they both use the sun.,3
150166,I think this because a solar oven is like picture a and picture b is closed up so it wont heat up like picture a would.,2
150131,"One reason it is like a solar oven is that it has convection currents, some type of radiation and conduction. The radiation is the sun or a lamp. The convection/ convection current is inside the container, staying in one place.",3
150139,I chose both are simaller because because the heat is trying to get out and the atomsphere and the glass just reflects the heat to the plants and the sun and the heat is making the plants and earth hotter.,3
150140,Radiation goes through the glass of the greenhouse to the plants so they could grow faster.,3
150144,"Picture A shows convection and conduction, and picture A shows the plants heating up in the sun.",2
150143,This is because the sun shines on it like the sun shines on the solar oven,2
150129,they both have the glass. and the sun,2
150148,they both are absorbing heat ,3
,,1
150142,they are the same because they act like a solar oven,2
150138,the glass is traping the heat. Also the heat is making the plants grow.,3
150090,one is that it lets heat in to heat it up,2
,,1
150089,Picture A is similar because it has glass same as the solar oven we made did. Also it has plants that are kinda like the food in our solar oven.,2
150098,This is because picture A shows a greenhouse and the it shows the sun coming in to the greenhouse. Another reason is because picture B shows people standing on earth and the sun beaming on them.,2
150093,"B because we had to use the sun fro the second try, and i choose B because it shows that if you use something to cover the top then that would be the atmosphere.",3
150114,it is bad,1
150086,?,1
150106,the erth in the sun reflect                       the sun of the radiotion,3
150069,Picture a is similar because it gets heat and makes the plant grow just like it make the chocolate and marshmallows melt.,2
150066,I picked a because it is heating up the plants to make the plants grow and on my solar oven it did the same thing but with food.,2
150072,They are both similar because the sun is reflecting on them and helping them to grow.,3
150059,"It is similar because it is sourd of like a box heating  something up inside.Also they both have Convection , Radiation and Conduction.",3
149964,"Picture A because the greenhouse is like a solar oven, like an outside layer.",2
149950,The pictures are the same as a solar oven because they all reflect heat and they let go of heat waves.,3
149955,I think this because it is like a box. Another reason is that heat is going in and not out.,3
149947,They are both warm and are surrounded.,2
149965,Both heat pictures heat is being observed by the sun. Both are getting heat.,3
149969,The green house is like a big box and it gets heat and keeps it.,3
150650,"Because (1).the atmosphere is like glass so the heat can not be let free,(2) it has a glass top like the oven.",3
149971,no,1
150153,the glass lets the heat get in but not go out. the inside of the greenhouse is being heated up,3
150195,One reason that they are both similar is because a solar oven does the same thing as the greenhouse and atmosphere it lets heat in but not out. The second reason they are both similar to a solar oven is because they both also heat up inside.,4
150194,Both are similar because they both trap heat from radiation. They also just generally trap heat.,5
150164,The atmosphere works like glass. Heat goes in and not out.,3
150200,They are both similar because they have plants and they are absorbing heat.,3
150169,the sun goes in then it goes out,2
150101,Picture B is similar to a solar oven because it shows what a solar oven does which is the sun rays deflecting the solar oven or turning into heat to go inside the solar oven. Also the atmosphere and the earth are like solar ovens because in between the atmosphere and the earth is the inside of the box collecting heat from the sunlight.,3
150105,"Both are similar because they both hold heat in, and they both only let a certain amount of heat go in.",4
150112,The glass aks like the atmosphere and the atmosphere akks like the glass.,2
150085,"I chose Yes  it reflects heat.""",2
150094,the earth is a big green house,2
150109,"Both A and B are similar  to the solar oven because they both trap heat and when I go outside in a sunny day it is hot, ans when I go into a greenhouse it is hot too.",4
150080,the earth yous the sun to power evting,2
150097,one reason is heat goes right throught the window the second reason is is that it goes it to the plants.,2
150095,Two reasons are that A has hot air coming out and cold air coming in and B is that the atmosphere only captures hot air and turned them into cold air,2
150087,One reason why A is similar is because the building looks like a box.Another reason why A is similar is because the sun id like the light you would heat the food up with.,2
150096,The answer is A because like a solar oven because the sun is refacing to the the glass.,2
150104,pic a isalike because the  a picture has a sheet of plastic and it is short and long just like a box,2
150092,is simual it heats by sun to,2
150897,i dont knowthe answer is conduction,2
150919,?,1
150924,theres arrows,2
151186,I dont now,1
151195,because the green hoouse has glass so the sunlight gose though it and earths water is like glass so it gose though,3
151182,they both trap heat and both,3
151180,A and b are the same as solar oven because they,2
150923,yes because they are similar earth takes heat energy and a green house also takes heat energy,3
151193,i dont know,1
151230,i think b,2
151228,"yes, picture A is similar
yes, both are similar
yes, picture B is similar",2
151217,i do not know,1
151227,i think  its b,2
151218,I don't  know,1
151209,i dot no,1
151213,The heat like in the oven does the same thing to earth. The heat hits the Earth and the comes back up again.,2
151219,They look noting alike.One has a green house and a other has a green house affect.,2
150900,They both get sunlight,3
150908,i choose this answer because the water is reflect the heat just like the foil does.,2
150910,because the answer is the sun will hit space,2
150902,One reason is the sunlight and plants grow within growing.,3
150909,One reason is that they are similar and that b is.,2
150904,i dont know,1
150906,it need sun for its purpose,2
150907,"I chose C because they all use radiation, convection, and conduction.",3
150905,"1. Pictures A and B show heat being trapped inside the building and the atmosphere as the heat may be trapped inside the stove.
2. Pictures A and B show heat getting into the building and the atmosphere as the heat has to have a way to get into the stove.",4
151224,A solar oven lets heat enter and traps it. The solar oven and both pictures A&B are the same because  they both do the same thing,4
151204,"1.the first one shows the sun hitting the greenhouse 
2.the second one shows the sun hitting the earth",2
151222,im so sorry i dont get it,1
151212,"I chose that both B and A are similar because it shows that when the energy gets inside of the greenhouse, it's trapped inside. For the earth, the blue arrows try to escape to space but they bounce back when they try to escape. the same shows with the greenhouse. It bounces back and can't escape.",5
151205,picture a is similar because the radiation goes through the glass and also the blue lines reflect off each other like a solar oven.,3
151216,"picture a transfers, shows energy, and has a smaller space to give the plants more energy.",3
151203,both pictures show energy not escaping,4
151215,They are similar because there is a lot of light coming in on the picture. There also is in real life,3
151223,a solar oven is absorbing the solar energy while pictures a and b have the light passing through.,3
151208,I don't know,1
151202,one reasons is because the sun goes in it. The second reason is because the sun gets trap in it,3
151206,The atmosphere is the glass for the Earth.,3
151210,nos,1
151226,Because picture A is absorbing the energy from the sun.  Picture B is show the sun giving the energy to the greenhouse.,3
151211,I think that because they both contain heat .Also because both have the same radatoin,3
151220,Picture B. and A. has captured the heat and keeps it there.,3
151231,sun reflects to make it hotter,2
151207,it looks like it because it looks like the heat is bouncing of it cant get out and the heat is getting trapped there.,3
151229,idk,1
151192,Wild guess.,1
151188,They are both similar because they both have something to do with heat.,3
151178,"I chose my answer because both try to attract heat to rise the temperature. Also, they absorb it with trying to lose the least amount of heat as possible.",3
150915,They're both similar because they're gathering solar radiation.,4
151199,the two reasons  are  that they are reflecting the answer which is,2
151191,the oven is like the glass for the plants and food. also it keeps the heat inside.,3
151196,idk,1
151200,I think this because it is heating up the plants in side a room,2
151165,"first reason  the sun is like energy  
second reason the sun in reflecting on the desk is energy
last reason because  when you leave something outside for a long time   it is really hot the sun.",3
150921,"In the solar oven, the glass is keeping the heat in, just like in picture A and B.",4
151194,because they are similar,2
150922,because all three take in heat and absorb it and they all put heat up stuff,3
150917,The heat bounces off the heat oven and so does Picture 1 and 2.,2
151176,The glass makes the sun reflect and makes the sunlight hotter.,3
151198,b is similar because the glass makes the sun reflect because it makes the suns light hotter.,3
151174,the red arrow is going to the the floor of the green house,2
150918,"One reason is that a greenhouse looks similar to a solar oven, and another reason is because heat is trapped inside both a greenhouse and a solar oven.",3
151190,i do not think they are simialiar because,2
151181,I chose neither because the solar oven gives its self heat.,2
151201,both temertures decrease,2
150916,because they are both sun transfer and the sun ray are coming and leaving.,3
151179,I said both because they both have a picture of the sun heating the world/greenhouse and they both have the heat leaving the place,3
151225,i don't now,1
150909,Neither are similar because the heat has to go inside not outside.,2
150902,One reason is that the picture B is the sun is hitting the equator and picture A is showing everything.,2
150900,"1.A greenhouse has traits that work like a solar oven.
2.The world let's out heat",2
150910,"Because the sun attracts to the class, and the oven will do the samething",2
150919,i do not know,1
150899,"Picture A is similar to a solar oven because the greenhouse is trapping the heat in. Also I choose picture B because the Atmosphere will trap the heat in, so it will heat the Earth up.",4
150905,"The atmosphere, the glass in a greenhouse, and a clear covering on a solar oven all let heat into something and heat can bounce of of them all",4
151216,"Picture b is similar because the heat source atracting up toward the earth and then going up. Also, because there is a heat source heating up something.",2
151208,"One reason is that the walls are like the plastic wrap.
The other reason is the roof is like the tin foil.",2
151225,the sun goes threw the glass,2
151229,they isorb heat and shin at something like our solar oven,2
150917,"A solar oven would let heat come in and make the oven hotter, like picture A and B. As well as, the heat would stay in the in the place.",4
151190,picture A is similar to a solar oven because when you are building a solar oven you want it to attract heat and that is what its doing in the picture.,2
150921,All 3 have a heat source and something to keep the heat in.,4
151176,They each have the sun heating up. And they both become hotter.,2
150918,"One reason why I chose this answer is because a greenhouse attracts heat and allows heat inside, similar to a solar oven.  Another reason why I chose this answer is because in picture B, when the greenhouse effect is happening on Earth, the sun shines down on Earth and bounces off of it, or reflects, similar to a solar oven.",2
151179,Because both of them are getting hit by the sun and becoming hotter.,3
151177,Because like in picture A it shows how the sun is going to the plants and in picture B it shows how the sun is going to the earth.,2
151174,i think its the same because they share the same amount of light,3
151200,"They are both similar because they are both using the sunlight for heat. Another reason they are similar to the solar is that they all have examples of radiation, conduction, and convection.",4
151196,Because they are similar.,2
150907,The pictures are similar because they the sunlight comes in and the plants/people absorb the heat and the glass/Atmosphere is letting out the sunlight that isn't wanted and keeping the rest of the sunlight inside the earth/ greenhouse.,4
150908,B because the water is like a tin foil it reflects the sun and the land is staying there and absorbing the sun.,3
150906,Just like a solar oven the earth and the greenhouse are counducting the sun and for both of them the sun is giving of radiation.,4
150903,They are similar because they both are getting heat from the sun.,2
151220,"They both use sunÝ rays, and the rays can escape.",4
151231,because glass and tinfoil are simular.,2
151209,i dot no,1
151223,Solar ovens keep heat trapped in it while the pictures show the heat trapped in the house/atmosphere.,3
151210,nose,1
151181,I chose yes they are both similar because they both have heat travel.,3
151182,Yes because the greenhouse is like a bigger version of a solar oven but instead of cooking its supposed to keep plants warm all winter.The atmosphere is like a larger version of a greenhouse and a solar oven because it captures heat like a greenhouse and solar oven.,4
151192,Picture A shows the radiation happening. It has the heat rays creating warmth in the green house. Picture B does not display this.,3
151199,beacause it is so yeah,1
151186,They both look the sam and both use the sun,2
150915,They both show how green houses attract heat,2
151193,they are simalar because they both reflect heat.,2
150916,In the picture the sun rays can't leave the glass and in picture b the sun ray can't leave the force field.,3
151205,they both have the sun and blue arrows coming from the sky and one leaving.,3
151206,They are both similar because a solar oven gets hot and those picture are getting hotter.,3
151203,they both show radiation and they show the radiation escaping,3
151214,no because on picture b the sun is reflecting. neither are because it's so difrent.,2
151212,Picture A and B are similar to a solar oven because they both show that the sun is transferring energy to the earth and the greenhouse and for a solar oven the sun transfers energy to the box. Another reason why A and B are alike to a solar oven is because they both use saran-wrap-like materials. The greenhouse uses the solar panel as saran wrap fro the sun to get into the greenhouse and the energy can't escape. The same with picture B. The sun transfers energy to earth and the energy tries to escape but the atmosphere of earth is like a saran wrap.,5
151202,the sun makes heat with each pitcture,2
151204,one reason is the both get sun and the second reason is the both hit the green house .,2
151207,it looks like a box shape and it shows how it trapps it,3
151211,because it gets hot and because it is under the sun,2
151188,They are similar because they both involve the sun and heating up.,2
151201,A shows the heat coming through  the glass attracting heat. B shows the sun not attracting the earths heat,2
151228,i pick picture A because it is similar.,2
151215,The sun is in both pictures,2
151219,IT does not look like a greenhouse and because it is not hitting to the sun,2
