153977.0,the solar oven will let the heat get in and then it will not let them get out as easily as the green house does or the atmosphere does,3
139842.0,the glass increase the heat of the sun rays because of the glass also that the inside of the house keep it warmer because of inside of the house is warmer than the inside,3
139543.0,since picture a and b works similarly a solar oven also has this type of process the solar oven traps heat in and try to keep as much of it inside and not let it out just like a green house,4
139506.0,they are similar because they trap heat inside and allow it to rise temperatures another reason is having this glass type of surface that allows it to be similar to ovens,4
154193.0,the green house acts like the atmosphere like it keeps the sun inside the amosphere keeps the heat inide,3
150065.0,they both let sun rays in and trap the hat inside,5
136391.0,i chose what i did was look at the picture and it had the glass part looking like the earth i chose this also because of the it was setup i also chose this awnser becasue the plants would act a little like the marshmellow,2
150066.0,well i don t really know what a solar oven is so maybe the heat from the sun is going through the glass and giving the plants heat so that might be a solar oven,2
150156.0,sajkv,1
118585.0,both are similar because the heat enters the solar oven and gets trapped,3
136468.0,in think they re the same because they both keep air in and they both get reflection from the sun,4
139819.0,they both let in and retain heat,4
118538.0,for question a the energy wont be able to escape for question b the energy is going but some of the energy is ascapeing,2
154343.0,the solar oven needs to keep heat inside but if it dosnt it really cant be called a oven if it cant heat any thing up,2
136408.0,in picture a the energy is entering the greenhouse but is not able to exit that is what happened with the solar oven in picture b energy is going down from the sun and when it hits the earth it reflects back up in the solar oven when the energy hit the aluminum flap it reflected wherever it was tilted,5
136419.0,they both are because a solar oven uses solar energy to heat things so do greenhouses and the earth s atmosphere,4
118398.0,only part a because it shows how it is like a soleronven and the other resone is that it keeps the house clen,2
118297.0,they bot are absorbing heat and they are both heating something up with heat,2
139491.0,both picture a and picture b are similar to solar oven because they all demonstration the same concept of heat entering and trapping heat and keep a area warm,4
154157.0,i think both because the heat is inside and it sometimes gets out on picture b and on picture a it stays in,4
150114.0,it is bad,1
136367.0,i think they are both similar to the solar oven because in picture a and b they were showing the heat getting trapped in the atmosphere and the green house when we were working on our solar ovens we were trying to trap the heat in side the oven so it can cook the marshmallow,4
150077.0,pictures a and b are similar to a solar oven because the heat goes inside and some heat goes out like a convection current,4
150230.0,the greenhouse is similar because the heat is being kept in and also because both are bouncing off something,3
136424.0,it is like a solar oven because it is a confined space that keeps the heat in it also uses heat from the sun to heat it,2
136549.0,the light is absorbs into the green house earth and the oven the it heats up the release light,4
136423.0,the plastic on the solar oven traps the solar radiation from the sun inside the box the box releases inferad from the heat,4
150130.0,the atmosphere is like pane of glass the stops the heat from escaping,3
139495.0,the pictures are similar because the sun s radiation is trapped and used as a source of energy the solar oven also has a glass like material that takes the light from the sun,5
139544.0,both pictures trap heat like solar ovens do both have a source of energy that enters through a glass and that energy in the form of heat cannot escape,5
154107.0,there similar because it shows the sun reflecting of the earth and arrows are reflecting off the earth,3
149965.0,both heat pictures heat is being observed by the sun both are getting heat,3
118304.0,they all trap heat inside and they all are powered by sr,5
153991.0,both have something keeping heat in and both are heating object s,4
118391.0,it captures solar energy and turns it into heat energy and releases infrared radiation it also relies on the sun to do things without the sun there it can t capture solar energy and turn it into heat energy,4
150061.0,i said they are both smilar because they show how some heat goes in and comes out like a solar oven,2
118542.0,yes they are both similar because the solar energy helps the plants grow in the green house and the solar oven cooked the food with solar energy,4
118577.0,because solar ovens work the same way because as the solar oven the greenhouse reflects light too,2
136398.0,first off picture b and a are similar to a solar oven because the sun s rays keep bouncing up and down like how you cook something in a solar oven another reason they are all alike is because they all collect the sun s rays and energy and they don t let it escape,5
139787.0,similar cause the both take in the heat and absorbs the heat,3
149589.0,yes the sun enters through plexiglass the atmosphere and is reflected off tin foil earth,3
139534.0,a solar oven has a plexiglass that traps heat inside just like the glass in picture a and the atmosphere in picture b the light coming from the box gets reflected back into the box just like how the light from the earth gets reflected back into the earth and how the light inside the house gets reflected back,5
153826.0,picture a shows the sunlight passing through the glass and hitting the plants in picture b it shows the sunlight hitting the earth,3
139855.0,name,3
136414.0,i think both are similar because they reflect and absorb light heat,4
136378.0,they both come in and gets reflected so it can t escape like how the solar oven will hold the heat then to cook whatever that is inside the solar oven,4
139482.0,they both let in radiation turns the light into heat and traps a lot if it in,5
139832.0,they are both similar because they both accept light and the inside heats up,4
139834.0,they both take in heat and trap it a solar oven has properties that does not allow heat to leave,4
149590.0,picture a is similar because it has the heat is going through the glass like our solar oven also the heat is transfering,2
118522.0,its like the greenhouse because it keeps heat in it also reflects heat,3
150207.0,the pictures are similar because the objects are trying to absorb the radiation,4
139845.0,these two pictures are similar to each other they have conduction coneiction and radiation,3
136477.0,reflecting off some thing both need the sun to heat both have conduction,3
154327.0,b because it shows the hot air going in ad having trouble going out,3
118348.0,they are both because it reflects,2
136482.0,picture a and picture b they both have solar radiation coming through the top of the project they also both keep the heat inside and don t let it out,5
118628.0,first they both absorb and collect the solar radiation and turn it into heat secondly they both reflect some of the solar radiation,4
139876.0,a and b traps heat inside a and b has something to do with energy,5
136549.0,light comes down and hits the solar oven then it reflects that is exactly what is happening in bot of the image light also goes threw the roof of the green house and the atmosphere just like the plastic wrap on the box i know this from are lab when we did the box s with albito and green hose gasses,4
151209.0,i dot no,1
150915.0,they re both similar because they re gathering solar radiation,4
118533.0,picture b is most similar because the green house is like a solar oven box,2
136372.0,picture b is similar because in the picture the heat bounces off the earth like a solar oven it is also similar because the sun heats up the earth like a solar oven,2
136387.0,when you build a solar oven you want it to get warm inside like the greenhouse you also want the heat to stay in the oven just like the atmosphere does for the earth,3
118568.0,si porque son,2
136518.0,in picture a the house is absorbing and using heat also in picture a the house is containing heat in an area i even think picture a is like a solar oven because a solar oven absorbs sunlight and traps the heat inside,4
139818.0,they are both similar because there is conduction and convection happening,3
136494.0,the greenhouse is similar to a solar oven because the heat stays in the oven and doesn t go out also because the heat is keeping something inside or on the greenhouse warm like a solar oven does,3
136398.0,these pictures are both similar to a solar oven because they both absorb the heat from the sun and they don t let it escape plus in the pictures the heat spreads through out the atmosphere and the greenhouse just like a solar oven,3
118352.0,the reason both are similar to the solar oven we created is that the solar oven like the pictures a and b reflect light but absorbs light as well,3
154345.0,one reason is that the arrows show how the hat gets in and a greenhouse keeps heat in,3
139806.0,yes they both are similar because they both absorb the heat energy from the sun and keep the heat energy from escaping and solar oven has the sun purpose absorb the heat from the sun and save the heat energy for the other purposes,5
139831.0,both are similar to a solar oven because a solar oven is able to let heat energy in and retain most of that energy,5
150097.0,a is similar to b because heat is going trough and reaching the tomatoes a is also similar to be because its both atrackting heat,2
118521.0,the atmosphere acts like our plexiglass,3
151225.0,i don t now,1
153924.0,because they both give heat they both get heat,2
154304.0,they are similar because picture a and b and a solar oven all use the sun to heat up the inside of the structure they are also all alike because the atmosphere and the glass and the cover for the solar oven all trap heat inside the structure,4
136355.0,i say yes because they both are light that can t escape so is a solar oven,4
151228.0,yes picture a is similar yes both are similar yes picture b is similar,2
150128.0,they are both similar because they both show heat entering an area but being unable to escape and they both show how convection can heat an area up,4
118320.0,there both similar because the sun is shining in both of the pictures,2
118583.0,because the plastic rap is the atmoshere and when the solar radiation and heat go into the box it takes two or three trys to escape,4
151220.0,they both use sun rays and the rays can escape,4
154156.0,the green houses at the earth and earths atmosphere traps the energy,4
150118.0,the solar oven will be able to trap heat from the sun and will get at a hi tempurture,3
136404.0,i think picture a is similar to a solar oven because a oven needs heat to heat up and the solar energy heat is passing through the greenhouse heating the place up,3
139816.0,our goal of the solar ovens was to trap heat as much as possible to see the build of temperature overtime the design and flow of light energy is what we were aiming for,3
139535.0,picture a shows a green house which its purpose is to attract more heat just like a solar oven the sun s light waves are able to penetrate the glass but are not as able to escape easily which is necessary for the solar oven in order to heat up food,2
150203.0,they are both are trapping heat,4
154317.0,they both look similar because its shooting beams in and shooting beams out my other reason is because it keeps heat in,4
139864.0,they are both similar because they use the sun s natural energy to heat up things inside of its barrier,4
118405.0,i think its like mty solar oven because the hot air stays inside and is bing odsever by the plants same with our solar oven the heat heats the food it is also the same because the sun heat the glass same with our solar oven,3
154314.0,picture a is more like a solar oven because it has glass on the top like a solar oven would,2
136392.0,picture a is the most similar because it shows heat getting absorbed in and trapped in there like an oven for example an oven needs to get heated up so it absorbs the energy it gets from sun radiation then it gets trapped in there to heat something up,4
136499.0,they are both simalar because they both show the greenhouse effect absorbing heat and reflecting heat and it shows the solar radiation passing through the glass panels or the atmoshphere keeping some heat from escaping,5
150218.0,the sun is going in to both of them and both of them let the hot air go,2
154310.0,it show how both pictures show how it simalur to a solar oven because it shows how the heat goes in the solor oven and how it absorves and some reflect,4
150089.0,picture a is similar because it has glass same as the solar oven we made did also it has plants that are kinda like the food in our solar oven,2
150231.0,one because it is showing ul all there is and two beacuse shows there envirment,2
118353.0,because the reflection is like the foil also the black paper holds in the heat,2
118536.0,the glass or plastic will trap the sunlight and the tinfoil will reflect the sunlight into the item in the solar oven,3
118597.0,they are both similar because they both are getting heated like the solar oven and they are both observing sun light,3
139882.0,picture a is similar to a solar oven because they both need the sun in order for it to work and produce heat picture b is just the sun giving off light to earth which is also similar but not the best example for a solar oven,3
151186.0,they both look the sam and both use the sun,2
118414.0,they both take in heat both trap heat,3
136426.0,cause they both attract rays like the solar oven,2
139812.0,yes they are similar because it absorbs heat and traps it inside,4
150101.0,picture b is similar to a solar oven because it shows what a solar oven does which is the sun rays deflecting the solar oven or turning into heat to go inside the solar oven also the atmosphere and the earth are like solar ovens because in between the atmosphere and the earth is the inside of the box collecting heat from the sunlight,3
136559.0,the heat is trapped inside for the most part on both of them,4
118592.0,my first reason is that is that both pictuers are simalar to the solar oven because the green house kept the hot and the atmosphere lets the hot air in seacond reason is that the hot from the atmosphere will let the hot air in and it goes to the solar oven,2
119017.0,they both are doing the same thing but in a different diagram for solar ovens heat goes in heats what is inside then goes out like in the diagrams,2
136369.0,my first reason is because it traps the suns heat just like a solar oven would my second reason is after the suns rays are trapped they are used in away for the plants,2
150919.0,i do not know,1
153916.0,a solar oven would have some type of clear cover over it to let sun rays in and out in picture b the clear cover is the atmosphere also in both a solar oven and the earth some of the light reflects back,3
154133.0,why is b similar to a because the both get sun and the sun comes out to like tomatoes when they grow they get sun to grow or sunlight that s why b similar to a,3
136352.0,they both can trap light and heat from escaping and also makes it warmer on earth and in the greenhouse like a solar oven,5
150922.0,because all three take in heat and absorb it and they all put heat up stuff,3
154108.0,one reason why both pictures are similar to solar ovens is because they both show something trapping heat in a second reason is because they get their heat from the sun,4
136519.0,it could get some heat and get the heat and trap it inside getting it hot,3
139487.0,both picture a and b show examples of hot heat from the sun is transferred onto a glass panel or the atmosphere which will heat up the inside components this will be similar to a solar oven because the outside will make the inside warmer to cook things with,2
139856.0,i don t know any about a solar oven i just guessed,2
153908.0,both are similar because they are showing how the light reflects inside the space another reason is that both spaces like a solar oven have electricity bouncing in the space area,4
136506.0,first of all they both are similar because they both trap in heat second of all they both conduct heat from the sun like a solar oven,2
150198.0,in some ways they are simualar to a solar oven one way would be that with picture a it shows that sun is going into the greenhouse like a solar oven would to,2
136419.0,all three of them trap heat to make something warmer all of them reflect some heat back,4
118450.0,i think the both are similar because the solar radiation shines through the solar oven the brightness reflects off the foil creating more heat the black paper around the sides of the solar oven help absorb more heat,3
154127.0,both have something that acts like the glass also both have something being heated up,2
118308.0,they are both using the sun and they are both using heat to help the plants grow,2
136580.0,picture a is similar to a solar oven because they both need silver stuff at the top of them they both need the sun for energy,2
118368.0,heat can reflect through plastic wrap the same way it goes through glass,2
150918.0,one reason is that a greenhouse looks similar to a solar oven and another reason is because heat is trapped inside both a greenhouse and a solar oven,3
118458.0,the solar radiation is transfering into the green house like the sun comes into the box the heat is staying in the green house like the heat usually stays into the solar oven,4
118600.0,they both heat the ground or floor,2
154210.0,one reason is the glass of the greenhouse and the atmosphere both absorb and reflect the second is that both the green house and the atmosphere warm up a thing like the earth or the plants,3
140326.0,they both have the same aspects of how they let in heat they both have different types of insulators that keep heat in,3
118602.0,i said a is similar because the green house is like a box and the green house is traping the heat into the box,3
136546.0,they are both similiar becasue they have different materials or layers to trap or reflect the sunlight they also work like a solar oven keep in heat make the thing inside hot or cold,5
139505.0,similar to a solar oven both pictures portray heat being trapped by a layer of certain material in addition both pictures gain their heat energy from the sun which is also where the solar oven gains its heat energy from,5
150059.0,it is similar because it is sourd of like a box heating something up inside also they both have convection radiation and conduction,3
154309.0,yes they re both similar to our solar oven the first reason why i think the two pictures are similar to a solar oven are that they both show conduction convection and radiation just like a solar oven the second reason why they are both similar to a solar oven are they both show the heat leaving and entering the atmosphere greenhouse this will happen to our solar oven even though we can t see it like we can in the pictures,3
154123.0,because like the glass palstic is like it it traps the heat,3
136461.0,i think a because the oven absorbs light just like the green house does and uses it to power things,3
118469.0,in a the heat goes in in a the heat doesn t come out,3
150128.0,b is similar because the atmosphere acts like heat absorbant material a is similar because the greenhouse roof acts like heat absorbant material,2
136505.0,picture a is because for one thing the suns rays are going down into the greenhouse just like the suns rays would go down on the solar oven and two once the suns rays go into the greenhouse the heat from the sun is trapped in the greenhouse just like the heat gets trapped in the solar oven,2
136567.0,it heats the oven and keeps the stuff hot,2
139739.0,they are similar because both worth in a process of heating up an object objects with the source of the sun which makes them warmer,2
153822.0,picture b is similar because the sun is going onto or into the earth and producing heat this is what a solar oven does because light goes into the oven and heats u the oven,3
139525.0,both of the pictures have ways to trap heat in in a way we are also in a solar oven and are being cooked alive,4
150070.0,because they both have something to keep the heat in,3
136416.0,yes because it traps some of the heat but not all of that heat,3
150122.0,i chose that both are similar to a solar over because first of all both of the pictures are both an example of the greenhouse effect so that make them similar and finally they are both similar to a solar over because they both have to dpo with trapping heat and they change whatever is inside of it warm or hot,4
153863.0,because it shows that it iss heating up,2
154336.0,becues they both have soliar stymes they both hve sun,2
150144.0,a is a greenhouse the atmosphere is a solar oven and the atmosphere traps heat,3
118612.0,the oven is like the earth and the greenhouse because it lets the heat in but not out untill a while,3
136572.0,the atmosphere traps the heat just like the plastic rap of the solar oven,3
154155.0,both are similar because they both retain like a solar oven also radiaton goes in and turns inito heat,4
136450.0,it will let heat in and will not let most of it escape,3
154304.0,i think that they are both simaller to the sollar oven because all three have the sun involved and they all trap heat,4
136504.0,i think both are similar because one of them is reflecting from the light also the other one is absolving the heat,4
153924.0,well it is the same because the both keep heat in like the soler oven,4
154114.0,the first reason is that the atmosphere can trap heat so it reflects it back to trap it the second reason is that a solar oven traps heat by reflecting it,3
153905.0,it shows how the heat will rise the oven s temperature and how the heat will exit it also models the roles that some of the materials will play like the plastic wrap compared to the glass for a greenhouse of the atmosphere,2
153929.0,both are similar because they let in energy and let out cool air,4
153830.0,the solar oven would have a cover like the glass and atmosphere some cover materials could be either plexiglas or plastic wrap if we used plastic wrap as an example the heat will pass through the plastic wrap and keep bouncing off the plastic wrap so the heat can stay inside the solar oven just like heat stays inside the earth and the greenhouse,4
154000.0,the heat is most likely going to get trapped in so it heats up,3
139543.0,they both trap heat and have a convection,4
136361.0,picture a is like a solar oven because the heat is going through the windows and it can t escape so it gets hot in there there is also the windows that acts like plastic rap so the heat dose not escape,3
136555.0,the green house panels bring in the heat and it traps it so it can heat up the room,3
118410.0,yes becas it is right,2
150219.0,i chose that both were similar i chose this because the sun heats up a solar oven as it does for the earth and a greenhouse i also chose this because the pictures and a solar oven use sunlight,4
154160.0,picture a is similar because the heat is going inside the greenhouse and it has glass so it can be like plexyglass,2
153860.0,two reasons are that it has panels to attract the sunlight and solar ovens have black paper to attract sunlight another reason would be that it is sealed so that only the radiation from the sun comes in and a solar oven uses plastic wrap to trap the energy,4
153837.0,a is similar because it s a greenhouse and the greenhouse can relate to a solar oven also because the radiation can go inside and effect the plants growth,3
136459.0,they both are reflecting and attracting heat and they both produce heat fixture in both solar radiation and the solar oven resemblance,2
150056.0,picture b is similar because in a solar oven the heat gets trapped inside it then when you open it the heat goes out in picture b it looks like the sun s heat goes into the earth then it gets released,3
150160.0,i chose that both are similar because all greenhouse earth and solar oven keep heat inside of them,3
118348.0,yes both because some heat obsorbeds and reflects,2
118349.0,first they both need sun second they both need heat,2
153856.0,because they both get energy from the sun in my opinion,4
136502.0,heat gets traped n the green house which is heating up things,3
136501.0,these are similar because for one they are both drawing collecting heat from the sun and the both let heat in and do not let some heat out much like a solar oven does,2
118372.0,it is alike beacouse the green house lets heat in,2
118311.0,because the heat is hiting whatever is inside and there is glass like the plexi glass in our solar oven project,2
153838.0,i chose both of then because they both are the same thing the only difference is the piture,3
139841.0,name,3
149962.0,they all use the sun,3
136373.0,b because once i put the timfoil and the light hits the timfoil its would go back up and once it hits it it woud heat up,2
154128.0,the glass is like the cardboard because it lets the heat in but not out,3
139822.0,heat is given from the top and acts like radiation,3
139545.0,yes both are similar because they both trap heat and store that energy inside,5
154126.0,my reasons that picture b is like the solar oven because the heat stays in and the heat warms up the food or drink,3
153926.0,yes they are like a solar oven because the sun goes through the plastic rap you put it on your oven to keep the heat in and then it stays inside because the atmosphere keeps the heat inside and then when the heat comes through the glass it stays inside,4
136387.0,in a solar oven you want to keep the heat in but allow it into the oven just like the glass or the atmosphere do they also use rays from the sun to warm the area you cause more heat by hving the particles bounce around resulting as heat,4
118307.0,one my solar oven has some material to keep my heat in plexi glass two it has reflectors tin foil,3
139778.0,they are both similar to a solar oven because they both allow sunlight to travel in but then trapping it while also heating the area up,5
118583.0,because the solar oven holds in the heat and the amplifises the heat,3
153911.0,one both sun rays bounce off a solid object and back into space two both solid objects have something growing in the place,4
154320.0,a the solar ovens have a boundry that is the cardboard that acts like either the glass or it acts like the atmosphere in the case of the picture showing earths greenhouse effect b the sun heats up both kind of like an oven and the point of the boxes is toohave the greenhouse effect which is kind of like an oven and all three mimik an oven and or greenhouse effect,3
118556.0,it is similar because the plastic rap keeps the heat in the box and it is similar because the tin foil reflects the heat,2
139869.0,i said yes because the radiation showed and because it showed more than picture b,3
136462.0,pic a is the same becasue the greenhouse abosorbs heat and the plants use it also the not used heat leaves the greenhouse same thing with pic b pic b shows the sun rays going into the atmosphere warming it up the energy that was not used is going to space,4
154196.0,a similiar because the heat goes in and creates heat also it is similiar because they both use heat to heat up something,2
136551.0,a solar oven traps the sun so it can bake it,2
118454.0,a greenhouse is a giant glass box that keeps heat from escaping once it gets inside because apparently plants like heat because logic sound familiar this is just an excuse for the directions for this questionnaire all my reasons are in reason above,3
118597.0,i think it is picture b because it also is observing light,3
139509.0,picture a is similar because the solar oven consists a plastic wrap which is similar to both atmosphere and the glass panel and the heat is trapped in solar oven is similar to heat trapped in the house and the earth surface,3
118486.0,i said picture a because the heat has to inside the oven and it can t escape or else it won t heat up also the heat can t escape from the oven,3
154206.0,heat bounces of both off both of them both the earth and the plants become warmer,3
150907.0,i chose c because they all use radiation convection and conduction,3
154195.0,the sun s heat enters a space and can not leave in all three pictures the heat energy reacts by heating up the area its contained in,4
154141.0,both of them are like a solar oven because they are both using a system of light and there is a way to trap the energy from the sun inside the solar ovens are the same because you have light and you can have plexiglas on the box just like the panels and atmosphere,5
154317.0,there both similar because its shooting out sun ray and bring back more sun rays,3
154152.0,because it looks like one and the heat is going in the greenhouse like the heat goes in the oven,2
118618.0,one reason is that the heat light will bounce off of the shiny reflectors another reason is that most greenhouses are humid and hot the solar oven also reflects the light which creates heat to heat up the food,3
139508.0,both pictures are like a solar oven because the sun s rays are able to penetrate through and they each have some sort of container that does not allow all of the heat energy to leave once they enter also the light that reflects back also heats up the interior like a solar oven does to heat something up,4
136494.0,picture a is similar because the greenhouse is giving its heat to what s inside of it picture b is similar because it is holding some of the heat but also reflecting some of the heat,3
154330.0,because it looks like its heating the plants like a solar over would heat up with sunlight,3
154914.0,picture a is because it brings energy in but does not let it out picture b is because it keeps the sun s rays temporarily in,4
118442.0,because light and heat can get in easily but cant get out as easily because heat builds up faster than it can escape,4
118321.0,yes because both of them are absorbing solar radiation and you can see the solar radiation bouncing of both of the pictures,3
150237.0,the first one is because it shows radiation and the fact that the glass keeps it out,3
118440.0,the sun comes from atmosphere the atmosphere is where the heat is,2
118615.0,picture a cause we put plastic wrapper on top of the solar oven to heat up the oven to reflect and when you put a food inside the solar oven then the food will be heated,2
153935.0,both re similar because each of them show were the light is coming from and were it s hitting,4
6971.0,the heat that is reflecting is staying inside the earths atmosphere the sun reflects it bounces also because it is hot like an oven,3
118351.0,the picture of a is almost like twins the both absorb sun light,3
136685.0,it shows the light and energy coming in while heating up the area it also shows the way the energy moves like a solar oven,3
139882.0,it is similar because the greenhouse is absorbing heat just like how a solar oven does they both use solar energy in order for the experiment to work,4
153915.0,they both need sun,3
154315.0,they both are because the sunrays hit off the bottom of the box and the sunrays also get held in the box,5
136372.0,i think picture a is similar to a solar oven because the greenhouse is like the box and the glass on the greenhouse is like the cover of the solar oven,2
136375.0,because the greenhouse is made to make things really hot for the way that the plants grow also they are alike because they trap heat inside of the house,3
139787.0,they are similar cause they both trap in heat and reflect heat,4
153997.0,the both are because picture a shows how the height will stay in the box and b shows how the trapes it in the box,4
118456.0,it s similar like picture a because the solar oven also kept the heat inside and also it s like picture a because just like the solar oven the sun s heat shoots through,2
153994.0,the green house is a box sun rays are getting in and heating it,3
154120.0,one reason is that a solar oven collects heat and so does green houses in picture a second reason is that earth collects heat just like picture a like solar oven,2
136485.0,i picked yes it s similar to picture a because when i did my solar panel we put on a glass and the glass made it heat up plus the foil to and the black paper also because the sun will first trap inside the increasing temperature and make it heat up more because in picture a it s in a room with plants and the roof is glass so the sun reflects the glass and the glass will absorb the heat and trap it inside,3
136465.0,yes because the solar ovens absorbs the heat and doesn t let it out,3
136507.0,picture a is similar to a solar oven because the greenhouse reflects light and traps heat in the same way that a solar oven would picture b is similar to a solar oven because the atmosphere acts as the greenhouse glass when letting light through but trapping heat inside,4
139643.0,both are trapping heat using the greenhouse effect to heat the interior up and both require only solar radiation and no other source of energy,5
139477.0,i think both are similar because they both have the same concept to trap light and heat inside sunlight comes in and heat stays in and they both use the same energy source,5
150137.0,well they are both similar because like on question the earths atmosphere represents the glass of the green house which is similar to the solar oven because it has some sort of see through covering such as plastic wrap another reason is there goal is to get heat inside and not let to much out,5
151213.0,the heat like in the oven does the same thing to earth the heat hits the earth and the comes back up again,2
151226.0,because picture a is absorbing the energy from the sun picture b is show the sun giving the energy to the greenhouse,3
153983.0,i say both because the first picture is a house and heat is coming through the glass and giving heat to the plants to help them grow and the second picture pretend the atmosphere is a box and the heat is coming in through the box and gets trapped inside the atmosphere box,4
150127.0,the greenhouse is like a solar oven because it has a top clear roof and the sun reaching into the box the greenhouse is also like a solar oven because it has the sun to heat up the inside,3
154371.0,because they both let in ligth and both dont let it out,5
153864.0,they are similar because the both are using solar power and both have something that is transferring light into heat,4
118486.0,picture a because it absorbs the heat like the oven and it traps the heat and energy as the green house,4
150136.0,because the heat is bouncing back up into the window although it s trapped and another reason is because hot air from the sun is being lurched back and forth,3
154315.0,a is similar to solar ovens because it is using hot air a is also similar because it is making something you can eat when it is done growing,2
136489.0,i say that because the sunlight is being trapped inside of the greenhouse making the heat rise,4
150170.0,i think the greenhouse because it traps heat and the earth does not trap heat it blows off by the wind,3
151212.0,i chose that both b and a are similar because it shows that when the energy gets inside of the greenhouse it s trapped inside for the earth the blue arrows try to escape to space but they bounce back when they try to escape the same shows with the greenhouse it bounces back and can t escape,5
118463.0,because the black paper kept the heat in side the oven the plastic raping acted like a atmosphere and contain the heat from escaping,4
118437.0,in b the sun reflects like a solar oven in picture a the sun does not reflect,2
118400.0,i think they are both similar because in one picture there is reflection and in the other one there is heat coming out,2
153999.0,they both keep the heat to heat up what you need and both have the sun rays,5
149966.0,one of the reasons is that the atmosphere bounces the sunrays back like a solar oven bounces the heat back inside the greenhouse is trying to stay the right temperature or hotter for the plants like the solar oven tries to stay hot for a long period of time,3
154208.0,solar ovens keep in heat from the sun and infared radiation to create heat to warm up food,4
136514.0,i chose picture a because just like the solar oven the glass acts like the plastic wrap my group used when assembling the solar oven heat comes in as the glass panels are trying to keep some of it in and some of it comes out while some of the heat reflects out and that s why i chose picture because that s why picture b is similar to our solar ovens,2
150174.0,it looks like a solar oven because it is very light and bright,2
136514.0,picture b is similar to the solar oven because like a regular oven there needs to be stored heat in the oven so something could be cooked and it is the same thing with the solar oven the heat from the sun comes toward the solar oven getting trapped inside the oven so that something should be cooked on the solar oven just like a real oven exceot a real oven is used with electricity,2
