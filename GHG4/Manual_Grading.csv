136378.0,both pictures get reflected for example pic a is being reflected by the glass at the top of the green house like a solar oven like a solar oven pic a and b are heating something up in pic a it is the plants in pic b it is the earth so in a solar oven the food inside is being cooked,3
136363.0,picture a is like a solar oven because the glass panels are keeping the heat inside the room and picture b is like a solar oven because the atmosphere is keeping the heat down to earth,4
118524.0,both a and b are similar to my solar oven because they both are absorbing heat,2
136476.0,i chose a because the green room keeps the heat in the room also the other reason is that picture b is reflecting the suns raise,3
154313.0,because they both trap in heat and get heat from a light source,5
150176.0,in both pictures it is shown some sunlight gets in some gets out and some neither touch the earth or the greenhouse in conclusion both are very similar to a solar oven,5
154113.0,because a green house by its self its a big solar oven also because with a when warm air comes into a green house all of the air stays in there,2
139521.0,both picture absorb solar radiation and convert it to heat at the surface of the earth or the green house they also prevent infrared radiation from escaping by reflecting the infrared radiation back to the system and convert them to heat,5
136388.0,in a solar oven the heat waves are bouncing off the walls just like the heat in the atmosphere and the green house making the room earth or oven hot,2
150916.0,because they are both sun transfer and the sun ray are coming and leaving,3
154331.0,my answer is yes picture a is similar because in picture a the heat stays in and in picture b it reflects off the earth and another reasons is that picture a has a clear roof to have the sun go threw it,3
154318.0,yes because the greenhouse is like a solar oven because it is like a box and it has glass on top of it,2
118593.0,first on picture b it reflects the heat just like the solar oven secondly in picture a its heats the greenhouse just like it will heat the solar oven,2
118597.0,they are both similar because they both are getting heated like the solar oven and they are both observing sun light,3
118569.0,part a is similar because the sun is radiating on the plants,3
139517.0,a solar oven uses solar light to keep heat inside the oven in order to cook and both the greenhouse and earth keep heat inside also they all use solar energy,5
140326.0,they both have the same aspects of how they let in heat they both have different types of insulators that keep heat in,3
154159.0,it attacts sun light and keeps it there,3
118576.0,first it is simalar because the sun is reflecting off it and heating something second it is simalar because the sun is heating the green house and putting sunlight on the plants,3
154162.0,they both reflect sun rays they also both collect the suns heat,4
118393.0,i said both are similar to my solar oven because we had plastic over my solar oven and plastic acts like the same to glass another reason why i think my solar oven was the same because it still absoured heat,2
154218.0,well they both have the same reasons and it shows how it works and like maybe an example of something,2
139869.0,i said it was similar because it was set up equally and it shows how everything is in relation to convection conduction and radiation,2
150101.0,picture a is similar because in a solar oven the heat inside the greenhouse is similar to a solar oven inside,2
154846.0,both are similar because they have light heat coming through going into something like the plants in picture a and the ground in picture b and a solar oven has something in it that needs light heat they also have some kind of shield protecting it from getting too much light,4
150131.0,one reason it is like a solar oven is that it has convection currents some type of radiation and conduction the radiation is the sun or a lamp the convection convection current is inside the container staying in one place,3
154324.0,they both are trying to heat something up and they involve the sun or solar power,3
150111.0,because they are both the same,3
136457.0,once the sunlight shines through the glass panels atmosphere depending on scenario the heat gets trapped within them warming up or keeping warm what ever is inside,4
136464.0,my reason it that a solar oven covers the thing it is cooking and applies heat and solar rays and the two pictures show that the green house and the atmosphere is covering the earth and giving it solar rays at well and that is my reasoning,4
136465.0,yes because it is collecting heat then the heat is stuck in the earth,3
154193.0,the two pictures keep the heat in but it doset let it out now the second reason is that the plants or earth always get the heat,3
118615.0,because it is similar to picture a picture a shows a house with heat energy,2
118538.0,the heat is being absorbed but it is not getting out the green house is trying to keep energy from coming out,3
118514.0,in picture a and b heat is coming into the greenhouse also the heat is reaching the surface and staying in the picture finally the heat is either heating the plants or the surface of the earth,2
136569.0,both are similar to a solar oven because the heat is building up,2
139839.0,a solar oven will either absorb or reflect the heat from the sun to cook the food,2
118545.0,the light is heating the solar oven and the light is getting heated by the green house gasses,3
153838.0,there both simlar because it shows the same piture but in just differt areas an place,3
118402.0,it is absorbing the heat it keeps the heat energy from ecscaping,4
139855.0,name,3
150176.0,one the heat is shown to get in the greenhouse and atmosphere and two it also shown to bounce back or escape,2
154343.0,i think its a because the rays hit the plantss and go inside the little hut thing,3
118536.0,the glass or plastic will trap the sunlight and the tinfoil will reflect the sunlight into the item in the solar oven,3
136505.0,picture a is because for one thing the suns rays are going down into the greenhouse just like the suns rays would go down on the solar oven and two once the suns rays go into the greenhouse the heat from the sun is trapped in the greenhouse just like the heat gets trapped in the solar oven,2
154304.0,they are similar because picture a and b and a solar oven all use the sun to heat up the inside of the structure they are also all alike because the atmosphere and the glass and the cover for the solar oven all trap heat inside the structure,4
153983.0,i say both because the first picture is a house and heat is coming through the glass and giving heat to the plants to help them grow and the second picture pretend the atmosphere is a box and the heat is coming in through the box and gets trapped inside the atmosphere box,4
118309.0,solar ovens trap heat and they get lots of heat,2
118601.0,one reason they are the same because they use reflectors they are also they same because the reflector let heat come in and escape,2
118615.0,picture a cause we put plastic wrapper on top of the solar oven to heat up the oven to reflect and when you put a food inside the solar oven then the food will be heated,2
154135.0,they are both similar because they are both keeping the sun rays inside and not getting out of the atmosphere and they are giving out the sun rays to what is inside there terrrain,5
118401.0,they both act like a oven they keep the energy from getting out they use the energy to warm up the earth and plants and an oven for warming up food,4
118361.0,it is similar because i think picture a and b are similar because in are solar oven the box was really hot so in like picture a it did not let the heat go it so i think are solar oven did it to but picture b shows that the heat goes out so i think ares goes out to the heat goes out so i think are to,3
136495.0,they are both like a solar oven because they let in heat and keep most of it in also because they heat what is in the inside,4
139865.0,a solar oven takes in light a solar oven also lets in the light but traps it,4
153836.0,both have an atmosphere like an oven would letting in heat and reflecting out solar radiation both also i can see are letting out some heat like a piece of plexiglas or plastic wrap would on a solar oven,4
154322.0,my reasons are that they are both elated to the sun and that they both have something to do with plants and sun getting absorbed into them,3
150070.0,reasons why they are both simalar is because number one they both have a layer that acts as a barrier so the sunlight does not escape and reason number two is because they both have something inside that is heating up because of the sun,5
150132.0,i picked yes so that is why they are related they also use the sun for all three of them,2
136362.0,they are both similar they are similar because they use convection radiation and conduction just like a solar oven does they are also similar because heat is being put into an object in both pictures and being reflected but picture a has glass surrounding it and picture b has the atmosphere like the glass,3
136497.0,im guessing because ovens trap heat inside of the ovean to cook so like a green house it is traping the heat and the other one is the same,4
154133.0,my to reasons are that the suns heat is in both pictures and they both have the sun pointing in the earth,3
139516.0,they all have a way to take in energy and then a way to keep heat inside,5
153835.0,i think the greenhouse is lik a olar oven because the air comes in and then it stys in like a olar oven it is also lik a solar oven becaue the air is always hot in both a solar oven and a greenhouse,3
153836.0,picture b is similar because i saw some energy leave the box with the computer program and the picture here shows that some of the energy leaves the box and here the picture shows how some energy leaves the earth,3
136501.0,these are similar because for one they are both drawing collecting heat from the sun and the both let heat in and do not let some heat out much like a solar oven does,2
150154.0,they are both similar to the solar oven because the sun just goes right through the glass and the solar oven,3
139513.0,yes they both are because they all trap in heat they all uses conduction convection and radiation,4
154221.0,they are both similar because the sun and heat both effect the change of a and b,3
118580.0,one reason is the suns solar energy is going in then going out my second reason is it looks like the one from the video,3
154113.0,because both are like solar ovens because both of them keep the heat in and don t let any heat out,4
118512.0,a is similar because the heat only goes in and not out like the first picture also the green house and my solar oven both are using heat to provide it for the objects inside,3
139874.0,because they both have objects that represent the same thing or the same greenhouse effect,3
149588.0,they are similar to a solar oven by the radiation conduction and convection are all in each one and on each one something is heating up,4
118444.0,they both have atmosphere and glass just like plastic wrap and they both keep some of the heat in but let some of it out,4
136380.0,the plastic wrap on our solar oven is like the glass in a greenhouse and the atmosphere around the earth it keeps the heat inside a cooks or heating up the inside just like the glass and the atmosphere,4
136580.0,they are both similar to solar ovens because the sun radiates through the greenhouse the same way another reason they are similar is because they both use conduction convection and radiation the same way,4
150065.0,they both let heat in and keep it in,3
150052.0,one reason is because they both let the light shine to make it hot and because they both do the samething,4
154145.0,they are both similar because they are both showing the atmosphere surrounding the earth and the radiation going into the greenhouse another fact could be the radiation reflects on the earth and plants,4
118479.0,the heat affects the oven it bounces off the oven the heat goes into the atmosphere,2
136368.0,it is in a trapped space like the heat will be for the solar oven also the suns heat is helping the greenhouse work like for the oven,2
150239.0,they both have a top like plexiglass or plastic wrap but just the atmosphere and glass,3
136426.0,cause they both attract rays like the solar oven,2
150122.0,they are both similar to a solar oven because it uses the sun s rays for heat and traps them inside because of the heat trapped inside it warms up the stuff inside,5
136583.0,they both trap heat they make things warmer when in direct sunlight,4
118535.0,i think picture a is similar to the ovens because in picture b it shows that the heat is bouncing off of the earth and in the greenhouse it just shows that the heat is entering the house our didnt have heat bouncing off of it we had our oven soaking up all the heat instead,2
153999.0,they both keep the heat to heat up what you need and both have the sun rays,5
150197.0,they are both similar because the both trap heat in like plexi glass and they both catch heat and keep it there,5
154118.0,they both let sun come through and keep heat in they both heat up whats inside them,4
150919.0,i do not know,1
153834.0,one reason it is similar is that solar ovens keep the heat in like the picture another reason it is simiar is that the radiation does not go in just like the greenhouse,4
153834.0,both are similar because the glass as as an atmosphere on the solar oven as shown on both pictures they are also similar because the glass atmosphere reflects into the box as shown in the pictures,3
139539.0,both are similar because all reflect uv rays and covert them to infrared waves conduction happens when the uv rays hit the ground,3
150104.0,in picture a the heat is being captured because the glass prevents the heat from escaping in picture b the same is happening as in picture a,3
154118.0,they both keep in heat,3
118487.0,we are letting energy come in but we are not letting out and we are covering it with something,3
139831.0,both are similar to a solar oven because a solar oven is able to let heat energy in and retain most of that energy,5
150207.0,the pictures are both similar because they both are having sun reflect on them making it hotter,3
118415.0,one reason is that both my oven an picture a have glass to let the solar radiation pass through another reason is that they both are shaped like prisms,3
150114.0,ti macks the sun that is the energy,3
154109.0,picture a is similar because the house is like the box and the glass is like plexiglas,3
139876.0,both the greenhouse and the atmosphere of the earth are receiving heat energy from something and so as the solar oven both the atmosphere and the greenhouse are stores heat and so as the solar oven,4
154914.0,picture a is because it brings energy in but does not let it out picture b is because it keeps the sun s rays temporarily in,4
136561.0,the glass keeps the heat inside and the heat is used for power to help the plant grow and the oven used the heat for power too,2
136492.0,i think picture a is the like a solar oven because it s hitting the plants also picture b because the solar radiation is hitting the earth and is heating it up,3
153978.0,they both are bringing sunlight in without using electricity they both are using the sun to do something,4
149589.0,yes the sun enters through plexiglass the atmosphere and is reflected off tin foil earth,3
139811.0,name,4
118410.0,yes becas it is right,2
154160.0,one reason is that both the sun is going inside of the greenhouse and the earth the other reason is it stays in,4
150235.0,they are similar because the ovens trap in the heat and don t let it escape also they both use sunlight to do the things they were made for,5
139739.0,they are similar because both worth in a process of heating up an object objects with the source of the sun which makes them warmer,2
150156.0,sajkv,1
136372.0,i think picture a is similar to a solar oven because the greenhouse is like the box and the glass on the greenhouse is like the cover of the solar oven,2
153923.0,my first reason is that it keeps the earth warm and my next reason is that kind of sucks in the heat and doesn t release it so it keeps the earth warm,3
139775.0,because it uses natural energy which is the sun because heat is being trapped,4
139510.0,solar ovens can trap heat and keep objects warm reflect light much like both pictures,5
150121.0,yes beacuse it shows the sun rays beaming down on the earth like a box and the second reason is the atmosphere is like the plexi glass and the plastic wrap see through but protecting the earth or box,4
154214.0,because all have the reflection items like the atmosphere glass and plastic wrap and all use conduction convection and radiation to heat up whats ever inside,3
153816.0,a solar oven is actually most effective if it is designed like a greenhouse solar ovens utilize the greenhouse effect where solar radiation heats up gas,3
139832.0,they are both similar because they both accept light and the inside heats up,4
139496.0,in both pictures sun energy is being used additionally heat is being trapped as a result both the plants and the earth are being warmed,5
118549.0,i think that pictures are similar because my teacher side that the soler over will run on the power of the sun just like the green house the plants grow and the helps so they are both similar because they represent the same thing,2
150208.0,they are similar to a solar oven because the inside is slowly heating up and there are rays going in and out and it is transferring heat,3
153854.0,it shows how the earth acts like the plexiglass by collecting all of the heat also the heat shows how some of the heat bounces out but the heat bounces off of the atmosphere and black it the box just like our solar ovens do,2
118358.0,because the sun is reflecting off and because we did not use greenhouse gases and finally we did not need a greenhouse,2
154148.0,because they are both using radiation to heat something up and they both have similar things with it bouncing off,4
153977.0,the solar oven will let the heat get in and then it will not let them get out as easily as the green house does or the atmosphere does,3
118608.0,fist of all like the green house the heat is stayed in so it could cook the food second they are both hot when heated the greenhouse takes in the heat and so does the solar oven it takes heat to cook the food,2
139841.0,name,3
150200.0,they are both similar because they have plants and they are absorbing heat,3
154514.0,we are the tomatoes and are atmosphere is here protecting us from the sun s rays untill we grow bigger the panel,3
154199.0,one reason is that the green house is like a solar oven because the glass like in a solar oven goes through and heats up what is inside reason two is because the atmosphere is like the plastic wrap to it and it heats up the earth and like in a solar oven it heats up what ever is inside,3
151205.0,they both have the sun and blue arrows coming from the sky and one leaving,3
136392.0,one reason is that picture a is like a solar oven because it s conducting the sun s radiation and trapping that energy or heat in the greenhouse and then it s heating up the inside it s pretty much goes the same for picture b but it s just a different picture so picture a is like picture b and picture b is like picture a and like i just said it s the same just different pictures,5
150137.0,i said that a is more like an oven because it has glass and also keeps the heat in like the green house,3
150918.0,one reason is that a greenhouse looks similar to a solar oven and another reason is because heat is trapped inside both a greenhouse and a solar oven,3
150242.0,picture a is similar because picture b only shows the greenhouse effect that happens on earth while picture a shows a real greenhouse where light passes through the house,3
139495.0,the pictures are similar because the sun s radiation is trapped and used as a source of energy the solar oven also has a glass like material that takes the light from the sun,5
118358.0,they both trap solar energy and they both are used the same way kinda,3
118525.0,picture a is similar because all of the solar energy went in and stayed in the solar energy came from everywere,4
139491.0,both picture a and picture b are similar to solar oven because they all demonstration the same concept of heat entering and trapping heat and keep a area warm,4
139498.0,they all are trying to prevent heat from escaping they all prevent heat from escaping by using something to reflect it back to where it came from,4
139878.0,the glass panels block the heat from going outside also the heat is trap inside,3
150160.0,both act like a solar oven because when heat gets inside it cant leave,4
136399.0,the green house glass is giving the plants all they need to grow,2
153909.0,both picture trap the waem inside just like a solar oven another reason is tinfoil is kind of like glass and they both atract the sun,4
139522.0,yes because both trap heat and because both increase temperature,4
150093.0,b because we had to use the sun fro the second try and i choose b because it shows that if you use something to cover the top then that would be the atmosphere,3
151225.0,i don t now,1
153818.0,they both trap light to heat up something the light from the sun is used in all three,5
136492.0,the light is both being trapped in also the light looks like it is going in circles,4
118300.0,yes because the greenhouse is reflecting the heat from the greenhouse garden and my solar oven reflects with tinfoil to we put dark construction paper at the bottom that heats up the food,2
118530.0,because the sun light goes into the panels box the greenhouse box absorbed the light that goes into it,3
149969.0,the green house is like a big box and it gets heat and keeps it,3
139823.0,both contain heat energy both allow rays of light into itself,4
150245.0,a is similar to a solar oven because it is basically a bigger version of one and b is like a solar oven except humongous and in space,2
155053.0,they are both similar because they both trap and contain heat like a solar oven,4
150131.0,first picture a is a box like container with transparent panels to let the heat come through like a solar oven second picture b is contained by the atmosphere and the earth is what is inside collecting all the heat like a solar oven,2
118451.0,the sun bonce off the reflted surface warming up the black surface,2
118578.0,they are both similar reason the cover of the solar oven is absorbing the heat just like picture a and b reason the inside walls of the solar oven have the heat bouncing off each wall trying to help cook the food and in picture a the sun is trying to heat the room in picture b the sun is trying to heat the earth,2
118535.0,yes both are similar to the solar oven because they both attract heat just like the solar oven will also they both are used for making something turn into something else a seed into a plant a raw hot dog into a cooked hot dog,2
118537.0,first it is similar because the picture shows the sun absorbing into the object second of all because it shows that after it absorbs the heat it reflects off the object in this case it is reflecting off the food inside the box,2
150133.0,one reason why picture a is similar is because the heat is getting trapped in the glass which is like how heat gets trapped in a solar oven and allows it to heat up another reason why is because the air is heating up in the greenhouse just like how it would in a solar oven,3
153816.0,solar oven uses greenhouse effect,2
136372.0,picture b is similar because in the picture the heat bounces off the earth like a solar oven it is also similar because the sun heats up the earth like a solar oven,2
139819.0,they both let in and retain heat,4
118343.0,i think they re both the same because heat passes through the windows just like how heat passes through the solar ovens another reason why i picked that answer is because the atmosphere acts like the solar panels in the solar oven and the greenhouse windows are the same thing it acts like the panels in the solar oven,2
154127.0,they are similar because in both the pictures and the solar ovens there is something that lets in the energy and something that gets heated,4
136457.0,they re both heating up something within them a being the plants and b being whatever is living on earth also the solar oven being food they all involve heating things up with light and solar radiation,4
154154.0,they are both similar because they are both getting sun and light,4
150101.0,picture b is similar to a solar oven because it shows what a solar oven does which is the sun rays deflecting the solar oven or turning into heat to go inside the solar oven also the atmosphere and the earth are like solar ovens because in between the atmosphere and the earth is the inside of the box collecting heat from the sunlight,3
136368.0,they both have heat come in and keep the heat like you would want for a solar oven they both also have the heat staying inside of the atmosphere and the greenhouse gasses,4
154344.0,one reason why they are both similar is because they both are trapping in some heat like the solar oven another reason why they both are similar is because the first picture is radiation to trap heat in from space and the second picture traps some heat in and lets some heat escape,5
118439.0,both are similar because it lets light in and traps it,4
150109.0,both a and b are similar to the solar oven because they both trap heat and when i go outside in a sunny day it is hot ans when i go into a greenhouse it is hot too,4
136683.0,be case they have humedoty there hot and all three of them het something up,2
118579.0,the reason neither are similar is because both show sun going in and gas coming out solar ovens reflect the sun s energy and turn it into heat,3
118610.0,the light gets trapped in the solar oven heating the oven and the light bounces around and off our reflective sheet,4
118345.0,because ours lets it in but doesn t let it out,2
136563.0,you would use a green house effect to keep the heat in ant to help raise the temperature faster,3
153837.0,a is similar because it s a greenhouse and the greenhouse can relate to a solar oven also because the radiation can go inside and effect the plants growth,3
154323.0,they both generate heat the bot take light energyy,4
139853.0,they are both similar to solar oven because they both trapped heat,4
136546.0,the oven heats up things inside just like the atmosphere or greenhouse,2
118525.0,both because they both collect sun they both reflect sun,2
118442.0,because light and heat can get in easily but cant get out as easily because heat builds up faster than it can escape,4
153933.0,they are both similar because they have sunlight and panels and they help the plants,4
154319.0,my first reason is that the protection layer glass and atmosphere is keeing heat inside heating up the earth and my second reason is that they both have convection conduction and radiation,4
118603.0,cause it like the solar oven with the heat coming in and out,2
118400.0,two reasons both pictures are like my solar oven is because the sun is reflecting of of some thing and because something absorbs energy in both of the pictures,3
150062.0,both are similar because a solar oven makes the sun go inwards than outwards and both pictures show that,2
150078.0,none of them are similar because they don t use the sun power the same way,2
150248.0,i think this because they both have the same details one more reason is that they both are helpful,3
118465.0,the solar oven s plastic wrap let solar radiation in also it trapped the solar radiation in it worked like the glass atmosphere,4
139778.0,they are both similar to a solar oven because they both allow sunlight to travel in but then trapping it while also heating the area up,5
139529.0,name,3
154307.0,they are both similar because part a shows that the light is going in the plant and that happens in a solar oven part b is because that shows that the light is reflecting off of the plant and that also happens in a solar oven,4
154138.0,because a is geting heat and not letting in go out also b keeps the air from leaving so it is like the same thing,3
136380.0,they both are like a solar oven because the glass from the greenhouse and the troposphere are keeping the warmth heat in so it makes in hotter an oven keeps the heat in it while something is cooking inside to actually cook it they don t look like an oven but they act like one to keep us and those plant warm hot,4
150198.0,in some ways they are simualar to a solar oven one way would be that with picture a it shows that sun is going into the greenhouse like a solar oven would to,2
118518.0,the first reason is because the way a solar oven cooks the food is by heat the second reason is becaause the box needs to trap the air like a green house and the atmosphere,2
154000.0,the heat is most likely going to get trapped in so it heats up,3
153982.0,picture a is like a solar oven because some of the heat bounces off and some of the heat goes in like a solar oven,2
150178.0,yes the two pictures are like the solar oven because the sunlight goes through the box like the green house and the heat goes in the box,4
154129.0,one reason is it will reflect back to the sky in this case outer space two is the sun s heat or solar energy will come back as heat,3
139543.0,they both trap heat and have a convection,4
136574.0,one reason is that both of them can keep the energy and also because both can let the energy pass,3
118469.0,in a the heat goes in in a the heat doesn t come out,3
118459.0,the both are similar because the both don t let the heat escape and it from the earth radation,4
136408.0,in picture a it looks like the sun is being absorbed and is heating up the green house in the description it says picture a shows a real greenhouse where light form the sun passes through the glass panels and heats the inside the glass panels of the greenhouse keep the heat energy from escaping,4
150059.0,it is similar because it is sourd of like a box heating something up inside also they both have convection radiation and conduction,3
149953.0,i gave that answer because in the picture it shows the heat going in and leaving also because it shows the atmosphere keeping the heat inside,3
136359.0,they are similar because the sun goes straight through the plexiglas or plastic wrap depending on what you used it makes whatever is inside the oven heat up,2
139520.0,both pictures are similar to the solar oven in picture a the glass panel is similar to a solar oven because in a solar oven the solar panel takes in energy which serves as heat in picture b the atmosphere takes in the energy from sun onto earth like the energy from the sun to the solar panel to heat up an oven,4
139529.0,both gets heat and keeps heat,4
150241.0,one reason was because a solar oven needs light like a greenhouse does to make something the second reason was because i think the greenhouse relates more to the awnser i chose was because the solar oven and the greenhouse both need sun,3
118398.0,only part a because it shows how it is like a soleronven and the other resone is that it keeps the house clen,2
151228.0,yes picture a is similar yes both are similar yes picture b is similar,2
118471.0,the solar panels use the suns rays to generate power and the panels get heat into the oven and that heats up what is in the oven,3
151209.0,i dot no,1
154320.0,a the solar ovens have a boundry that is the cardboard that acts like either the glass or it acts like the atmosphere in the case of the picture showing earths greenhouse effect b the sun heats up both kind of like an oven and the point of the boxes is toohave the greenhouse effect which is kind of like an oven and all three mimik an oven and or greenhouse effect,3
118546.0,both are similar because one both let heat energy in but not out like the plastic wrap on my solar oven two all do that to keep the thing inside warm earth keeps us warm the greenhouse keep the plants warm and my solar oven cooks my food,4
149962.0,they all use the sun,3
150246.0,i think both because picture a shows that it projects onto the plants picture b shows how it goes in circles like convection currents,3
139481.0,picture b is the same as picture a because of why picture b is named the greenhouse effect and a solar oven is the same because a solar oven is absorbing heat energy while trapping it in the oven to not escape,4
118594.0,no neither are similar because ours is like an l and we used tinfoil,2
118947.0,both try to keep the energy to pass through it then keep it,4
118296.0,i think they are simalar because the solar ovens will let in heat but not let out heat katie,4
118614.0,one reason is they both absorb heat another is that they are both hand made,2
136393.0,the solar oven will let in the heat but will trap the energy it will bounce around heating the food the oven acts the same way the atmosphere and greenhouse glass does,5
154141.0,both of them are like a solar oven because they are both using a system of light and there is a way to trap the energy from the sun inside the solar ovens are the same because you have light and you can have plexiglas on the box just like the panels and atmosphere,5
118474.0,im in a rush so im guesing b,1
150231.0,one because it is showing ul all there is and two beacuse shows there envirment,2
139812.0,yes they are similar because it absorbs heat and traps it inside,4
154129.0,i think this because it allows heat to come in another is in will heat the core,2
139843.0,because the oven heats up through an opening and stays in there until closed,2
154111.0,one reason is the solar oven heats up the inside of the box like the pictures in a and b,3
151179.0,i said both because they both have a picture of the sun heating the world greenhouse and they both have the heat leaving the place,3
139834.0,they both take in heat and trap it a solar oven has properties that does not allow heat to leave,4
118575.0,first the unique glass keeps the sunlight flowing through the box or green house second the sun and the atmosphere keeps in all the gasses and keeps sunlight flowing in and out of the earth constantly third a solar oven has the suns rays hitting what ever your cooking on the solar oven,3
150204.0,i think both are similar because all three things heat something up and show conduction convection and radiation another reason is all three things let heat in but then it can t get out so it is trapped,4
154315.0,they both are because the sunrays hit off the bottom of the box and the sunrays also get held in the box,5
136483.0,i chose yes picture a is similar because the solar panels are something you can use for a solar oven another reason is because it reflects the power beams away so the solar panel can do that but shine the power beams on the food instead of reflecting them in or out,2
118319.0,both examples trap heat and do not let it out so anything inside will heat up,4
118367.0,because they both have glass,2
150235.0,they are both somewhat like boxes or containers that trap sunlight with something that lets heat in but not out use the heat they trap to heat things up,5
118446.0,the pictures are both similar to my solar oven because they both reflect sunlight onto something to heat it up or in my case bake it they also all use only solar energy to complete the task being shown in their pictures,3
118557.0,picture a and picture b are both similar to my solar oven because my solar oven also reflects heat and absorbs heat just like the glass and the earth,2
118527.0,i guessed,1
118315.0,one is that our solar oven has plexi glass which acts like a green house second our box keeps heat in the box like how the atmosphere keeps the earth warm,3
