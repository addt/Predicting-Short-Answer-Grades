118459.0,picture a is simalar by the green keeps the atmasphere inside like a solar oven,2
153995.0,picture a and b,2
118315.0,because the sun light will reflect onto the food and it will not close it will just use the sunlight it already has,3
153925.0,one is the sun bounses off the earth and the secoud reason is it is heating up by the sun,2
118347.0,it is the same because we used plexiglass and the heat stayed inside but did not go outside,3
118306.0,the sun makes the green house warmer than the air outside,2
136491.0,a solar oven absorbs heat and reflects it just like the pictures,2
154155.0,the heat goes through and how it saves the heat,2
154121.0,because the solor overn heats the plants up,2
139528.0,nan,1
140326.0,i think they are similar because maybe this is how the solar oven works,3
136475.0,they are similar because the earth is like the house on the other picture,3
150153.0,the heat goes in through the glass roof heating up the inside,2
118552.0,i don t know,1
118294.0,,1
149586.0,its because the green is catching the heat and putting it into the plants,2
118357.0,because the soler ufin is ceping the heat in and cooking the food,2
118366.0,the solar oven reacts like the glass of the green house or the atmosphere,2
118634.0,,1
154353.0,the sun is foing into thr erth the sun is shineing on the green house,2
154216.0,b because it shows the atmosphere the atmosphere gets the air,2
136480.0,picture a is going into the greenhouse and picture b is reflecting out of the greenhouse,2
153918.0,no because it depends on what materials you use and if you get something that can reflect light,3
118396.0,,1
154198.0,the a picture shows no reflection and heat wont stay in,2
118563.0,in my solar oven once the heat goes in it can t come out because i put plastic covering on the top and foil inside,3
118414.0,the could air would be gone the heat will stay in the box the box has to be filed with heat,2
149955.0,i think this because heat is inside and it is big,2
153927.0,they are similar because they atratca heat,2
139797.0,nan,1
150902.0,one reason is that the picture b is the sun is hitting the equator and picture a is showing everything,2
154316.0,it is similar because it heats up the green house and traps heat,3
154124.0,niether are similar because it has nothing to do with a solar oven,2
154337.0,which one of the structures are heat up the most you are comparing the differences of the to objects that are being observed,2
139881.0,nan,1
118527.0,because it has something that looks like plexie glass,2
154157.0,picture b looks like a solar oven because if you use tin foil it will reflect to the sun,2
118405.0,one is because the sun passes there the glass so the the plantes get the sun and they can grow one more is that the sun is has to hit the glass before getting to the plants so the sun has to hit the solar before getting to whats getting heated,2
118534.0,none are simillar because they are diffrent meanings,2
118526.0,i know this because the earth is the heat to are solar oven,2
150917.0,the heat bounces off the heat oven and so does picture and,2
150158.0,because they used the sun and,2
150079.0,is because picture b is realize the hat back in to the atmosphere and the heat is coming back because it gets cold another reason why is because the eath is like a big giant greenhouse,2
118416.0,,1
,nan,1
139879.0,nan,1
118624.0,,1
118637.0,,1
118554.0,the plastic is absorbing and the insidious is reflicting,2
151199.0,the two reasons are that they are reflecting the answer which is,2
118586.0,because you want the heat to be in the box,2
150218.0,a is similar because it is supposed to trap the heat,3
139496.0,in both pictures sun energy is being used additionally heat is being trapped as a result both the plants and the earth are being warmed,5
118534.0,because you have to have things like plastic rap tin foil,2
118517.0,thay are just doing the same thing basically,2
139875.0,they re the same because picture a is recieving heat and picture b is recieving and releasing heat,3
150156.0,because a uses the sun,2
150104.0,pic a isalike because the a picture has a sheet of plastic and it is short and long just like a box,2
150072.0,i chose yes so in picture a in picture b the same thing is happening but without the shelter or the plants,3
151229.0,idk,1
118560.0,because the sun is involed,2
150112.0,it acts like a giant oven and it has a window,2
154147.0,picture b is like a solar oven because the sun goes in and then it doesnt get out,3
118589.0,,1
139790.0,the heat is coming from the sun that heat is also trapped inside the car,3
118455.0,the plastic and tinfoil in the oven act like glass to magnify heat to use it too cook food,2
118543.0,i think neatheir because the green houses heat is obsorving and picture b some heat is reflecting another one is they are comparing the greenhouses and the earth,2
118616.0,,1
154703.0,the plants inside are like the food,2
151190.0,i do not think they are simialiar because,2
118318.0,on both pictures a and b they are both the same because the sun is going through earth and the house,3
118412.0,because the house is like the food and the sun is heating it up,2
150909.0,one reason is that they are similar and that b is,2
118417.0,,1
136417.0,i think picture a is similar because it has to deal with reflection,2
150136.0,the sun is beating down into the greenhouse and being transferred back,2
,nan,1
118457.0,a is similar because the glass will make the heat go through it so it can get hot,3
154329.0,b because it looks like the heat that was transferred from the sun to earth,2
118588.0,yes,1
139542.0,the solar oven is man made and uses reflective materials to absorb as much sunlight as possible the earth does not use any reflective material to absorb sunlight,3
118482.0,,1
118634.0,nan,1
154220.0,i dont know,1
150172.0,i think this because the earth is doing the same thing the house did,2
154311.0,the eart looks like the glass or plastic wrape and the atmaphear look like th tin foil,2
118463.0,because the solar oven has reflective sides so the suns heat will hit the object,2
150196.0,w,1
151174.0,the red arrow is going to the the floor of the green house,2
154215.0,first beacause it doesnt have to do with a box or plexiglas or aluminal flap plastic wrap construction paper or tinfoil second because your not using plants,2
139871.0,it has limited space and the heat bounces off,2
149967.0,the have sun light in the room and it keeps the heat in the room for the plants,4
150111.0,because it reflects,2
,nan,1
118406.0,they are both similar to solar oven because they both do act like a giant window the makes the heat more powerful,2
150109.0,the reason why i choose letter a because it looks the same it works the same way like how a solar oven works it goes in through the windows and stays there for a period of time,2
150242.0,picture b is more like a solar oven because it shows how the sun is shining through the roof the picture then show the sun going through the roof and some of it bouncing out,2
118484.0,,1
118475.0,it reflects heat like the solar oven and contains the heat,3
151196.0,because they are similar,2
154353.0,they are different because the sun is in different placess,3
150168.0,two reasons why i chose the answer yes,2
151227.0,i think its b,2
118465.0,neither are designed to get really hot,2
118555.0,picture b is simaler because that is how the solar oven works,2
139768.0,nan,1
139485.0,nan,1
151218.0,i don t know,1
139881.0,the heat will bounce around and,2
118308.0,we are making a solar oven and the pictures are related to a green house,2
150142.0,one reason is that they can is the plants grow,2
141560.0,nan,1
154200.0,picture a is more similar to the solar oven because has different materials and picture b is naturally there,2
153984.0,a is correct because the oven will suck in the heat and because it has a green house with plants,2
