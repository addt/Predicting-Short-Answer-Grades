WISEID,Answer,KIScore
154340.0,because it can cook something by the sun and the sun shining at the plants,2
118316.0,it is similar because it is kind of like a box,2
136412.0,the greenhouse looks like a box and how the green hose gadsses never escape it also shows the glass rough witch reminds me of the plastic wrap i used on my solar oven,2
150109.0,the reason why i choose letter a because it looks the same it works the same way like how a solar oven works it goes in through the windows and stays there for a period of time,2
118404.0,i said that a because the heat go in,2
151174.0,the red arrow is going to the the floor of the green house,2
150174.0,because the heat is bouncing off the ground,2
136556.0,i chose a because like a solar over the sun is shining down on the items within it,2
150648.0,they are both simiar because they both get heat from the sun and because they both have some type of shell around them,3
118534.0,because you have to have things like plastic rap tin foil,2
154215.0,first beacause it doesnt have to do with a box or plexiglas or aluminal flap plastic wrap construction paper or tinfoil second because your not using plants,2
150196.0,it a aracks heat,2
150897.0,i dont knowthe answer is conduction,2
150067.0,because the sun shines through the roof and heats it up and also the sun on the earth is like the lite on the solar oven,3
136399.0,they heat making them grow the crops,2
150133.0,picture a is similar because it shows the sun beaming down on a window or solar panel which makes it heat up,2
150919.0,,1
150163.0,because the solar oven was soppoes to get hot and the green house and the earths atmoshere,2
118485.0,,1
118621.0,because we added glass and it was similar to part b because it reflected off,2
139769.0,the lid on the greenhouse keeps in the heat like the lid on top of a solar oven,3
154341.0,you can cook something and the sun shinning at the plants,2
150060.0,both diagrams remind me of a solar oven and their descriptions,3
118349.0,a is simaler cause it does the same thing as a solar oven and it show you how it work and also how a solar oven works to,2
118577.0,because solar ovens work the same way because as the solar oven the greenhouse reflects light too,2
150130.0,the glass holds in heat and the atmosphere hold in the heat also,3
154153.0,because in the solar oven the heat goes away,2
118586.0,because you want the heat to be in the box,2
118451.0,because the the plastic wrap is like the glass also we have refeckte suface,2
118622.0,yes they are both similar because they attract heat,2
150157.0,they are both getting lots of heat help it grow,2
118527.0,because it has something that looks like plexie glass,2
150917.0,the heat bounces off the heat oven and so does picture and,2
118490.0,because it is nothing like the solar oven because it grows the plant what we are doing is experementing if the foils and the other objects we have,2
150089.0,picture a is similar because it has glass same as the solar oven we made did also it has plants that are kinda like the food in our solar oven,2
150069.0,picture a is similar because it gets heat and makes the plant grow just like it make the chocolate and marshmallows melt,2
118440.0,it is similar because it is solar and uses the sun the box is using the sun to make the plants grow,2
118612.0,the solar oven reflexts the sun to the object inside the box not into space,2
118354.0,because the green house has the solar oven like it but the b picture the sun jumps of the earth,2
136414.0,i think both are similar because they reflect and absorb light heat,4
150092.0,because that is solar energy,3
,nan,1
150098.0,this is because picture a shows a greenhouse and the it shows the sun coming in to the greenhouse another reason is because picture b shows people standing on earth and the sun beaming on them,2
141560.0,nan,1
154149.0,because the apnosphere and the glass are almost the same,2
118594.0,because the glass is in the roof and the heat come in it has the same effects,2
136422.0,i think that its a because some of the sun s heat comes inside the greenhouse and some reflects out of the greenhouse also the heat gets absorbs in the greenhouse,2
118366.0,the solar oven reacts like the glass of the green house or the atmosphere,2
149955.0,i think this because heat is inside and it is big,2
136520.0,nan,1
150203.0,it enovoles heat being trapped and heat coming in,3
154151.0,no,1
118562.0,k,1
118544.0,yes because the heat goes through the surface and hits whats inside it just like the solar oven,2
118309.0,because is a green house that absorbs heat,2
118611.0,,1
118511.0,because the heat in are second one wont get as must heat,2
,nan,1
151181.0,i chose neither because the solar oven gives its self heat,2
136354.0,its is similar because the moister give water to the plants and the atmosphere is not giving us to much light,2
139871.0,it has limited space and the heat bounces off,2
118634.0,nan,1
154204.0,picture a and b are like because you are still using the sun for both things,3
139796.0,nan,1
149972.0,the glass on a greenhouse and the earth s atmosphere trap heat like a solar oven would the earth and the things in the greenhouse absorb heat like the bottom of a solar oven,4
151214.0,no because on picture b the sun is reflecting neither are because it s so difrent,2
153917.0,these are the same thing,2
151180.0,a and b are the same as solar oven because they,2
118558.0,,1
118367.0,because they look diffrent from each other,2
153915.0,because it has glass,2
151204.0,the first one shows the sun hitting the greenhouse the second one shows the sun hitting the earth,2
136462.0,so the green house trapps the heat in the house like a oven heating food up just like that when you open the oven door the heat leaves to oven just like the green house,3
118483.0,,1
118408.0,because it is the same thing as the soler oven because it gets hoter and hoter,2
139873.0,nan,1
150222.0,in picture b it is simalar because the atmosphereis holding,2
154149.0,picture a has the glass to ceep it in picture b is like the glass in pic a,2
150149.0,solar ovens are closed up just like a greenhouse so heat gets trapped inside and can t get out also the heat that doesn t get inside the greenhouse or solar oven it reflects off the outer surface,3
118351.0,the glass absorbs the heat just like the plastic wrap absorbs the heat and cold air goes out also there is something easy to heat up,2
118624.0,,1
118609.0,nan,1
118577.0,nan,1
150129.0,they both have the glass and the sun,2
118533.0,because they both show the gasses and heath getting trapped and they both show heat reflecting,3
118520.0,nan,1
150086.0,,1
118346.0,because the green house in a close space and glass is like a plastic warp,2
118318.0,on both pictures a and b they are both the same because the sun is going through earth and the house,3
154196.0,because the solar ovens use the sun to cook food,2
118515.0,,1
150177.0,it is more detailed and helps understand more,2
154215.0,because it has a planet earth,2
136558.0,because heat is going right through the glass just like when it goes through plastic wrap and it needs the suns heat to cook,2
119017.0,reason one is that we get heated up but the sun reason is that we have ovens,2
154130.0,they are both similar beause it using the atmospere,3
118392.0,nan,1
136459.0,the both look like they are contracting towards something,2
139880.0,nan,1
,nan,1
150142.0,one reason is that they can is the plants grow,2
139542.0,the solar oven is man made and uses reflective materials to absorb as much sunlight as possible the earth does not use any reflective material to absorb sunlight,3
139808.0,nan,1
150071.0,picture a is a diagram of the house also picture a shows how the heat goes through the glass,2
154122.0,in the picture at part b it shows the heat from the sun entering the atmosphere like a solar oven and at part a it shows the heat entering the greenhouse,2
154335.0,the heat is trapped in the house like and oven,3
149961.0,it is bigger and it uses the sun,2
118455.0,we used plastic wrap on top of the lid of the box,2
153985.0,isaidso ithinkso,1
150231.0,my two answere are that because i think it is verry simmeler,2
150166.0,picture a is simallar becuse its closed like the oven,2
118481.0,it is just representing it in two different ways,2
136489.0,my two reasons are that both pictures show the area absorbing heat but it is reflecting a bit of the heat so it doesn t become too hot,3
118472.0,,1
118619.0,they both get radation and send off infered,3
154915.0,it is similar becaues it stop radeaion from coming in,3
118622.0,,1
118554.0,the plastic is absorbing and the insidious is reflicting,2
139881.0,the heat will bounce around and,2
,nan,1
151196.0,because they are similar,2
136566.0,the reason why is because they are doing the same thing and they are not letting any heat out,3
118418.0,if one is the same the other has to be the same every thing is the same except the solar oven is smaller,2
118368.0,they are the same,2
150094.0,the earth is a big green house,2
150080.0,the earth yous the sun to power evting,2
118419.0,yes it works like a greenhouse because shine to the sun,2
150144.0,picture a shows convection and conduction and picture a shows the plants heating up in the sun,2
118397.0,i think b first because in picture b we would be outside on earth while the sun would be shining down on our solar oven i also think b because in picture a we wouldn t be in a greenhouse testing our solar ovens,2
153987.0,i think by the air,2
