136382,"David's claim is wrong because his box heated up much slower than the short box. The heat in his box raised slower because the solar radiation and heat had a smaller target making it gain heat a bit slower. Since the other box was wide it caught more heat and radiation, plus the window to catch solar radiation was bigger making it absorb much more light giving it a high albedo. ",3

After 2 minutes the short and wide box heated up to 45.3 while the  skinny and tall box only heated up to 34.7. The short and wide box was just over 10 degrees warmer than the tall and skinny box. Not as much solar radiation was able to enter the skinny and tall box so it was not able to heat up as fast. The short and wide box had a bigger opening for the solar radiation to enter. This is why the short and wide box was warmer and David's claim was incorrect.,5

When energy is moving faster in one object than another, it is most likely that the object that has more energy will be hotter. David's claim is also incorrect because the wide short box trapped more heat than the skinny tall box. This is because the bigger the box opening, the more heat the box can absorb and release.  ",4
136381,"David's claim is wrong because because the window was so small, it let less heat in. ",3
136359,David's claim is wrong because the wide and short box is hotter because the heat has room to move around and the temperature got hotter than the skinny and tall box.,3
136372,David's claim is incorrect because the wide and short box was hotter by 8.2 degrees celsius.,3
136382,"David's claim is wrong because since the window is smaller, less heat can get in and warm the box. Also since it's tall and skinny less solar radiation will hit it, making it heat up very slowly. And probably getting it a lower final temp. The infrared radiation does get trapped in and has a less chance of it escaping, but not enough of it is getting in the box. On the wide and short box more heat is able to get the box heating it up to a higher temperature at a much faster rate.",4
136683,David's claim is incorrect because when i tested the wid and short it go much faster in the spam of time ,3
136390,David's claim is not correct. David's claim is not correct because he picked that the skinny and tall box would have the best temperature than the short and wide box And would heat up faster than the wide and short box. Some evidence to support that the fact that the wide and short box has the best temperature is that right when I turned the speed up the temperature inside the oven went straight up.   ,3
136388,"David's claim is incorrect because he said the skinny and tall box would get warmer faster, but the wide and short box got warmer faster. There is more space for the heat to enter even though there is more space to escape.",3
136362,David's claim is wrong because he said the tall and skinny would be warmer but the wide and short was actually hotter. The graph showed that the tall and skinny box when up but it took longer to go up than the wide and short. The wider box had more room to move the heat than the akinny one  so it got hotter.,3
136374,David's claim is wrong because the final temp for wide and short was 47.6 while the other hit a 32.9.,3
136380,"David's claim is not correct because the tall and skinny box got up to 34.2 in 2 minutes, the wide and short box got up to in 45.4 2 minutes. ",3
136378,David's claim is wrong because the wide box went straight up really fast so David is wrong.,3
136367,David's claim is not correct because the tall and skinny box got less heat and dropped to a lower temperature  than it was the first time when it was warmer.,3
136352,David's claim is partially correct because the skinny/tall box as a faster heat up time but was much cooler then the wide and short box.,2
136360,David's claim is partly because it doesn't take much heat in but doesn't let much out.,2
136379,David's claim is wrong because the wide and short one was wide so it took in more solar radiation than the   long and skinny.,4
6971,David's claim is ... because ...he said it would be a high graoh and i got a highgraph,2
136368,David's claim is wrong because the box he chose didn't have much heat come through to the inside of his box but the wide and short box was hotter because it had more heat come through.,3
136364,David's claim is wrong because the skinny and long one could not het that much heat into it so the tepuratre did not go up rapidly like the wide and short one.,4
136384,"David's claim is incorrect because he said the tall and skinny box would he more warm, but the tall and skinny box was a lot lower in temp. than the short and wide box. I think that the short and wide box got higher because there was more room for the heat rays to go in the box.",3
136393,"David's claim is partly correct because he said the skinny and tall box would heat up faster, as it would let out less heat, but it also didn't let in as much heat as the short and wide box. ",4
136413,"David's claim is wrong because the wide and short box was getting way more heat because the its bigger window also trapped more heat, so the more heat it traps the more hot it gets.",4
136394,David's claim is incorrect because the taller box seemed to trap less heat and took longer to heat up.,4
136405,David's claim is incorrect because it taking way longer to heat up. Also at the same time when being put in the sun the wide and short absorb a lot more heat than the other one.,3
136423,David's claim is incorrect because the skinny and tall box was barley heating up. it took a long time. and stayed about the same temperature all through.,3
136398,"David's claim is incorrect because on the graph at two minutes the tall and skinny box was at 34.1 deg. In two minutes the wide and short box was 44.9 deg. So, David's claim was incorrect.",3
136414,"David's claim is correct because when the box was wide and skinny it was faster, and when the box was wide a short, it was slower, and it reflected more. ",3
136408,"David's claim is partly correct because even if there is a small opening so it can't get out easily, it has to be easy to get in to get out.",4
136420,David's claim is partly correct because the tall and skinny box did let less heat out but it also let less heat in.,3
136419,David's claim is wrong because the wide and short collected more heat because of the opening and most of it stayed in because of the cover,3
136424,David's claim is wrong because it took longer for the tall and skinny box to heat up than it did for the wide and short.,3
136392,David's claim is incorrect because the skinny and tall one didn't collect as much energy as the wide and short one and it got to 35 degrees in 2 minutes and on the other hand the wide and short got to 45 degrees in 2 minutes and it collected more energy than the skinny and tall one. In the tall and skinny box the energy got into it faster but it didn't collect as much energy and in the wide and short box it collected a little bit slower but it collected a lot more energy and what really matters is how much energy and heat it could get.,4
136426,"David's claim is incorrect, because the wide and long box would contain the most heat.",3
136685,David's claim is wrong because the short and wide box got to a higher temp.,3

136425,,1
136395,David's claim is incorrect because the wide and short box got a lot hotter than the tall and skinny box in the same time frame. The wide and short box got hotter because it has a bigger opening so it absorbs more sunlight.,4
136474,David's claim is incorrect because the Wide and Short box heated up more in the same amount of time. ,3
136467,"David's claim is .incorrect.. because ... he thought that less energy would leave the oven, but  barely any got in.",3
136463,David's claim is wrong because the short and wide box heats up a lot faster in a shorter time period then the tall and skinny box does.,3
136483,David's claim is wrong because the skinny and tall took a long time for it to heat up when the short and wide heated up 2 times faster.,3
136461,David's claim is wrong because the wide and short was so much hotter evan at a shorter time spand and it also doubled the heat.,3
136465,David's claim is not correct  because the skinny and tall box only got to 25.4 and the wide and short box got to 42.1 at the same exact time which was 1.81 minutes. ,3
136459,David's claim is wrong because Skinny and tall actually took longer to heat up and wide and short was faster and it showed more energy than he thought it would.,4
136485,David's claim is ... long box and skinny box was better because ... it had more solar radiation and partly some of the heat souronded around . But i say no because the long box has more heat and infrarred radiation  and th etime was 2:25 minutes and it was alot more then the skinney box .,4

136496,David's claim is wrong because the wide and short heated up way faster than the tall and skinny,3
136489,"David's claim is incorrect because with the big box with the big window, the sun was absorbed quickly and kept rising. With the tall box with a skinny top, barely any sun gets in, compared to the big box.",4
136511,David's claim is correct  because the heat gets trapped in the skinny and tall one and the other not so much,2
136499,"David's claim is incorrect because he said that the skinnier one would heat up faster because it would trap more heat, but since the wider box is out flat, it contains more heat.",2
136506,"David's claim is not correct because when I watched both the skinny and wide box, the wide box ended up having a hotter temp. because it had a bigger opening for light waves and heat radiation to go through. So, this results in the wide and short box being hotter.",4

141563,David's claim is incorect because The wide and shorter is better.,3
136501,"David's claim is partly correct because, he was right in saying that less heat will be released, but less heat is being absorbed, as well. The short and wide box was a much higher temperature, than the other box, as approximately the same time passed by.",3
136493,David's claim is wrong because the wide and short oven got hotter in the same amount of time.,3
136512,David's claim is wrong because the wide and short box let more heat into thebox because it has a bigger opening.,3
136503,David's claim is partly right because the tall and skinny box did let out less heat but it let in less so the wide and short box worked better.,3
136498,"David's claim is incorrect because in the wider, smaller box, more heat is collected in the box because it has more mass. ",2
136520,,1
136494,David's claim is incorrect because the wide and short box heated up faster then the skinny and tall box because it has more mass.,2
136514,David's claim is incorrect because David said that he thought that the tall and skinny box was going to get more heat but actually the wide and short box was able to get more heat than the tall and skinny box because the tall and skinny box was able to get more heat than the tall and skinny box faster.,3
136522,"David's claim is incorrect because the wide and short box could take in more solar radiation because since the opening was bigger, more could get through.",4
136558,David's claim is wrong because the skinny and tall one has a smaller opening and heat can't get in.,3
136567,David's claim is partly right because the both heated at the same rate.,2
136555,David's claim is wrong because the tall and skinny one has a small path way for heat to come in and heat up but the wide and short one has a bigger path way for more heat to come in so the wide and short one will get more heat.,3
136571,David's claim is wrong because not as much heat is getting inside the oven but the wide and short one is getting lots of heat.,3
136551,David's claim is partly  because he is getting some heat but not a lot but with the wide one is sky rocketing,2
136566,"David's claim is incorrect because in the wider, smaller box, more heat is collected in the box because it has more mass.

C. in one minute. Even though the boxes are the same length, they a placed differently, so the heat will get out easier on the skinny & tall box.",3
136492,David's claim is wrong because when I put the skinny one it took a couple of minutes it got pretty hot.  But when I put the wide and short it got hotter in the same amount because all the energy has more room to move and that creates heat faster.,3
136361,David's claim is ..wrong. because ...the wide and short box has more area for radiation to get to.,4
136354,David's claim is incorrect because The sort and skinny box did heat up but not as fast and it didnt get as mutch heat as the wide a sort box did.,3

136482,,1
136457,,1
136456,David's claim is incorrect because the skinny and tall box heated up slower. I think the reason it went slower was because the mouth of the box wasn't wide enough for the sun to go into.,4
136454,"David's claim is wrong  because in 2 minutes skinny and tall only got to 33.8, and wide and short got to 44.4 at 2 minutes so that means David's claim is wrong. ",3

136475,David's claim is wrong because on the skinny and tall all of the heat came out of the box,2
141559,David's claim is rong because the wide and short one heated up faster then the skinney and tall one ,3
136481,David's claim is wrong because the heat was lower than the wide and short box. The tall and skinny box didn't collect that much heat because the window is smaller. ,3
136469,,1
136507,"David's claim is incorrect because the box he had predicted would have the higher temperature overall, turned out to be the colder one in the long run. This is probably because the tall and skinny box had less of a surface area to heat up than the wide one, which had plenty on open space.",3
136502,David's claim is incorrect because the wide and short got about 11 degrees more higher than skinny and tall.,3
136515,David's claim is wrong because the wider box can collect more heat ant a time and a lot fast.  ,3

136556,David's claim is correct because the tall and skinny box took a shorter time to heat up whereas the short and wide box took longer.,3
136560,,1
139536,David's claim is incorrect because the wider and shorter oven allowed more light to come in during a short period of time which turned into more generated heat. More generated heat increased the temperature at a faster rate than the tall and skinny oven. More light allowed more heat which caused a fast rate of temperature increase.,5
139541,David's claim is incorrect because the short and wide oven took a shorter period of time to acquire the same amount of heat as the tall and wide oven. The short and wide oven has a greater surface area so more molecules are able to hit the surface and transfer heat inside.,4
139545,"David's claim is partly correct because the tall and narrow box will release less heat, but the short and wide box will heat up faster which means he is half correct. This makes sense because the larger surface area means more of the box is exposed to sun which will mean that the box warms up faster, but since the surface area exposed is larger, the short box will lose heat more often, and the tall box will be able to retain its heat easier, but have a long time heating up,",3
139542,"David's claim is incorrect because the graph shows the wide and short oven heating up much faster. When sunlight is absorbed, it bounces around and leaves the system as infrared radiation. A tall and skinny oven forces the sunlight to stay inside longer, but it does not heat up more quickly. In the short and wide oven heat is not kept inside as long as the other oven, but it heats up extremely quickly.",3
139540,"David's claim is wrong because the data has proved that a short and wide oven would absorb more energy than the skinny and tall oven. The short and wide oven has a bigger window, that provide a larger space for the movement of particles.",4
139866,David's claim is incorrect because the box that was wide and short heat up faster. There was alot of movement going on in the wide and short box so this made it heat up faster.,3
139544,"David's claim is incorrect because according to the model, the wide and short box seemed to heat up much faster than the box that was tall and skinny. Based on the graph, the wide and short box had a steeper slope than the tall and skinny box meaning it heated up faster. Based on the model, the movement of the energy was happening much faster since it had such a wide window, it is able to let more of the solar radiation and the infrared radiation in compared to the skinny window which only allowed half of what the wide window allowed. The wider window gives more space for the radiation to be passed through and being trapped.",5
139864,David's claim is incorrect ... because ... since the wide and short box has a bigger opening it can take in more heat ,3
139863,"David's claim is ... partly correct because ... even though skinny and tall had a hard time heating up, its better at maintaining heat since its more skinny. The wide and short heats up quicker but isnt able to maintain heat as well. ",3
139495,"David's claim is incorrect because the wide and short oven heats up faster not through the window but through the cardboard and the bigger the window, the more heat it can trap.",3
139494,"David's claim is incorrect because the wide and short box's temperature increased faster after 2 minutes. The movement of energy causes one solar oven to heat up faster than the other because their is a wider space for the heat to enter and be trapped, thus letting less energy leave the oven. ",4
139492,David's claim is incorrect because sunlight energy can only travel through glass. The tall and skinny box has such a small window that not enough sunlight can travel through causing it to heat up slower. ,5
139824,"David's claim is incorrect because according to the model, the wide and short box heated up much faster in the first two minutes than the skinny and tall box. More heat gets absorbed faster in the wide and short box because it is shorter. Heat had to travel further into the box in the skinny and tall box making it harder and slower to heat up.",3
139482,David's claim is incorrect because a wide box will allow more radiation to come in making the oven hotter,3
139493,"David's claim is false because based off of the data recorded, we can clearly see that the wide and thin box was a better solar oven. This happens because there is more surface area, allowing for more sunlight to enter in and create heat within the box.",5
139483,"David's claim is incorrect because as we saw in the graph of our experiment, the short and tall box heated up faster which is due to the movement of the energy. The short box was - shorter, so the energy did not have to travel as high to heat up the given area it was trapped in vs. the tall box where it had more distance to travel in terms of latitude wise. ",4
139834,"The radiation moves downwards into the solar panel, so the wide and short one does better, since it has more surface area to allow radiation to happen, heating it up faster than the tall one, since it doesn't have space to heat up.",4
139515,"David's claim is incorrect because the wide and short oven heated up much faster than the skinny and tall oven. Because the wide and short oven had a bigger opening for sunlight to enter, it received more heat energy through radiation than did the skinny and tall oven. ",5
139831,"David's claim is incorrect because while he was correct that less heat energy will leave from the top of the smaller opening from the tall and skinny box, the wide and short box absorbed more solar radiation, allowing it to heat up faster. ",4
139525,David is incorrect because the skinny box did not attain a higher temperature than the wide box.,3
139514,"David's claim is incorrect because his claim was that the Skinny and Tall oven will heat up faster because it will let less energy leave the oven. The oven did not have enough energy going in, thus not heating up fast enough while the Wide and Short oven has lots of energy going into it, heating it faster. More energy is also stored at the bottom of the oven.",4
139520,David's claim is incorrect because a skinny and tall oven does have a smaller window but it does not let less energy leave the oven. A wide and short oven has a bigger opening so more energy enters the oven and less energy will leave it.,4
139518,"David's claim is incorrect because the wide and short box increased to a higher temperature faster than the skinny and tall box.  The surface area of the skinny and tall box was less than that of the wide and short box so less of the sun's energy was actually received by the box.  Unlike in the wide and short box, there was less of the heat energy present in the skinny and tall box.   ",4
139527,David's claim is incorrect because the wide and short box has a wider surface area allowing more sunlight radiation to hit the box and warm it up whereas the tall and skinny box captures less sunlight.,3
139506,"David's claim is not correct because the wide and short box heats up faster because the heat particles have an easier time to get in, and have a hard time getting out. This is seen by looking at the diagram within 2 minutes. Another piece of evidence is the graph for the wide and short box, the temperature of that box was 43.1 degrees in the span of 2 minutes. While the skinny and tall box only got to 33 in the span of 2 minutes.",3
139832,"David's claim is incorrect because in the models, it was shown that more heat entered the wide and short box compared to the skinny and tall box. Because the wide and short box allowed more light and heat to enter at one time, the movement of energy was faster, generating more heat and resulting in a higher temperature compared to the skinny and tall box.",4
139833,"David's claim is not correct because the wide and short box was able to have more light energy reach the inside and that allowed for more heat molecules to be formed. The tall and skinny box couldn't take in light energy as fast and therefore, the oven wasn't able to heat up as fast. ",4
139505,"David's claim is incorrect because the evidence from the graphs show that the short and wide box heats up about two times faster than the skinny and tall box. This is due to the larger surface area of the window on the short and wide box. The windows on each box allows more radiation from the sun to enter the box, but the heat energy trapped inside cannot escape because the glass acts as a barrier to prevent heat from escaping. Therefore, with more heat entering and the short and wide box compared to the skinny and tall box, the short box will heat up faster.",5
139508,"David's claim is incorrect because the wide box has a larger surface area, allowing more space for the radiation to hit the surface of the box and transfer the heat energy inside the box. Since there is more radiation entering the box, then that means that there is also more heat energy entering. The thinner and taller box has less surface area and allows less radiation to enter and the tallness of the box aso makes it harder to transfer heat energy to the bottom of the box because the molecules and waves have to travel a longer distance.",5
139507,"David's claim is ... partly correct because ... while less heat was able to escape from the tall and skinny box since the window was smaller, that also meant less heat was able to get inside due to the small surface. In the end, the short and wide box actually heated up faster than the tall and skinny one.",3
139836,David claim is incorrect because using a tall and skinny box does not really allow heat to penetrate through the box it also does not keep heat as good as the wide and short one. Having A wide and Short box will make it easy for the light rays to penetrate the box which will heat it faster.,4
139526,David's claim is not correct because the wide and short box heated up faster due to the fact that the surface are facing the sun is greater which means that there is more area being exposed to the sun.,4
139528,David's claim is incorrect because when tested in the model above the short and wide box proved to be able to collect more sun rays. Although it had a bigger opening the amount of heat that escaped was little compared the heat that was collected.,4
139521,"David's claim is incorrect because the wide and short ovens has more surface area for the glass, which more heat from radiation pass in to the oven. The graph shows that the wide and short oven have a bigger instantaneous rate of change in increasing the temperature. Skinny and tall went from 0 degree Celsius to 35 degree Celsius in 2 minutes. Wide and short went from 0 degree Celsius to 45 degree Celsius in 2 minutes. This means, the wide and short one heat up faster.",4
139517,"David's claim is incorrect because the wide and short oven although can let more heat escape, can let more heat in. The wide and short oven also has a smaller space from where the heat comes in to the bottom compared to the tall and skinny solar oven which allows it to collect energy faster.",4
139861,"David's claim is incorrect because the skinny one took longer to heat up all the way through, the heat had to travel a lot to get to the bottom while the wide one had more surface area exposed to the solar radiation, allowing it to heat up faster.",4
140326,"David's claim is incorrect because the wide and short solar oven got hot faster due to easy access to get light inside, the tall and skinny oven was harder to get energy inside. ",3
139543,David's claim is incorrect because the long and wide oven has more sunlight reaching it compared to the long and skinny one. This makes the solar oven heat up faster then the skinny oven.,4
139865,David's claim was wrong because the wide and short collected more sun rays and was able to build up more heat quicker than the tall and skinny solar oven.,3
139538,David's claim is incorrect because the graph shows that the wide and short model has a higher temperature after the same amount of time.,3
139533,"David's claim is ... 
incorrect 
because ...
the wide and short box has more space for sunlight to enter through and increases the temperature of the oven more quickly. ",4
139539,David's claim is skinny and tall will heat up faster because the window is smaller so the heat will stay in. I think this is true because glass lets the heat in and out but other materials will let heat stay much longer because of its heat capacity and its conductivity.,2
139537,David's claim is incorrect because the wide short oven has more surface area that will absorb more heat the tall skinny oven because there are more solar radiation that is hitting the short wide oven which is converted to heat and the more solar radiation that is being converted as heat the faster the oven heats up.,4
139862,David's claim is partially correct because the tall and skinny structure traps heat better than the short and wide structure due to the fact that it is taller and has less area for the heat to leave the structure,2
139535,"David's claim is wrong because it was the short and wide box that was able to heat up more quickly. The Sun's energy is able to be transformed into heat more quickly, as there is more room for it to travel around. ",3
139534,David's claim is incorrect because the wide box's temperature was higher at 4 minutes than that of the skinny box. This means than the wide box heats up faster by absorbing more heat and trapping it. The wide box gets more heat since its surface area is wider. ,4
139487,David's claim is incorrect because the design of a solar oven can impact the heat energy flowing within the insides to heat it faster or slower.,3
139826,"David's claim is incorrect because the wide and short oven allowed more sunlight to come into the oven. The more sunlight in the oven, the more infrared radiation was being acquired and transferred to heat. ",5
139481,"David's claim is incorrect because the wide and short box is not only a bigger ""net"" of catching all the sunlight and turning it into heat energy it is trapping it as well.",3
139485,"David's claim is incorrect because according to the data, the short and wide box absorbed more heat than the tall and skinny box. The window of the short and wide box allowed more sun ray to come in which means that there are more kinetic energy that is happening inside the box which causes the temperature of the box to increase faster than the tall and skinny box that has a smaller window.",4
139497,David's claim is incorrect because because after one minute the thin and tall model rose 9.9 degree compared to the short and wide model rose 12.3 degrees. The short and wide model was able to absorb more heat because it has a wider opening therefore more sun rays were able to heat the model.,4
139479,"David's claim is incorrect because the wider box heated up at a quicker rate compared to the thinner box. In the wider box, solar radiation enters the box at a quicker rate. Less solar radiation enters the thinner box, resulting in less movement of energy in the box.",3
139480,"David's claim is incorrect because the graph of the wide and short box had a greater slope than that of the tall and skinny. Because the window in the wide and short box is wider, there is more surface area for the energy to enter through, allowing it to heat up faster. ",5
139496,David's claim is incorrect because a solar oven that is skinny and tall create shadows and increase heat loss. The most successful solar oven is wide and short because they intercept more sunlight; therefore it will heat up faster.,4
139488,"David's claim is incorrect because ...when graphing the temperature vs time graph on both boxes, the wide and short box heats up faster than the tall and skinny box because at 2 minutes, the tall and skinny box is at 32.6 degrees Celsius and the wide and short box is at 45.5 degrees Celsius.",3
139477,"David's claim is incorrect because the sun rays goes in all directions and has a higher chance of hitting the wider box and more heat will be trapped inside, increasing the temperature of it quicker than a skinny box with less chances of sun rays hitting it, therefore not trapping as much heat nor increasing in temperature as much.",4
139486,"David's claim is wrong because the skinny and tall boxed didn't allow much heat to be pushed in, is was mostly just rejected. While the short and wide box allowed more heat inside because it had a larger opening which doubled the greenhouse effect.",2
139830,"David's claim is incorrect because based off the graph, in a matter of 1 minute and 30 seconds, the wide short box heated up faster because of the movement of energy from inside the box was faster than that of the tall and skinny box. The sun rays from the sun bounced around a lot faster because there was more space for it to travel and hit another. More heat begins to build up inside the box because of the more space it has.",3
139501,"David's claim is not correct because after checking the graph, the wide and short box was able to heat up a lot quicker than the skinny and tall box because more sunlight was able to enter. Since there was more space for more sunlight to come in, the box was able to heat up faster than the skinny and tall box where sunlight was not able to come in as easily.",4
139829,David's claim is incorrect because the smaller the are the less energy will go in and wont have enough for the sun to heat up something very tall.,3
139489,David's claim is wrong because in the graph the temperature of the wide and short box increased in temperature in a shorter amount of time. The movement of energy causes one solar oven to heat up faster than the other because one allows more energy to go into the box.,3
139490,David's claim is incorrect because the skinny tall oven did not retain as much energy unlike the short wide oven.,3
139491,"David's claim is wrong because the skinny and tall heat up slower because there area small place where the sun ray could enter then box and make it slower to heat up the inside, while the wide and short had a bigger surface area for the sun to enter and warm everything.",4
139478,David's claim is wrong ... because ... the small space the model had to absorb heat was not enough to continue absorbing unlike the wide model which had a larger space to absorb the light rays,3
139827,"David's claim is not correct because the skinny and tall box had less heat than the wide and short box trapped inside, so the wide and short box would be able to warm things up faster",3
139498,"David's claim is ... incorrect because ... if the oven is wider, more heat can enter the oven causing the oven to heat up faster compared to the skinnier one. ",3
139499,David's claim is incorrect because shown in the diagram the wide and short box has more heat particles in the box compared to the long skinny due to not having alot of surface space.,3
139823,"David's claim is incorrect because the tall and skinny box did not have a high of a temperature as the short and wide box. The latter had more surface area for the sun to radiate, while the former has less surface area to be radiated.",3
139509,"David's claim is incorrect because in the model, the temperature raised faster when the oven is shaped as wide and short, this is true because I noticed that more heat is trapped in the oven than the tall and skinny one.",3
139510,"David's claim is partly correct because the amount of energy escaping is less, however, it also meant that the amount that was entering was also less.",3
139513,"David's claim is incorrect because the shorter wider box allowed more solar radiation to enter through the box heating it up more quickly. And with all the solar radiation to enter through, the movement of energy was greater creating more energy.",3
139523,"David's claim is not correct because in the experiment, the short and wide heated up faster because the it had more surface area on the inside for the sun rays to hit the walls of the container, therefore trapping in more heat inside the container of the short and wide one rather than the tall and skinny one.",3
139524,David's claim is incorrect because the shorter and wider oven took a shorter amount of time to heat up compared to the skinny oven. Possibly because the wider surface allows light to be captured more directly than the sides of the skinny box.  ,3
139519,"David's claim is incorrect because despite the energy leaving the box, the temperature of the box was still changing. The sunlight didn't have to travel as far down the wide box as the skinny tall box, and it reflected faster from the bottom of the box heating up the box faster. The skinny box was allowing less energy in than the wide box.",3
139522,David's claim is incorrect because the wide and short one heated a lot faster and more compared to that of the tall and skinny one. There was also more movement on the structure of the wide and short one. ,3
139516,David's claim is incorrect because when the sun rays hit the wide and short one it is easier to collect the energy then the tall and skinny one,3
139511,"David's claim is ... because ... the wider and short box contained more heat than the skinny and tall box, further revealing that if you wan to have more heat inside, you should design a smaller but more area box. ",3
139536,"David's claim is incorrect because the short and wide reached a higher temperature than the tall and skinny setup within the same amount of time. Since the short and wide window allowed more sun to come in, more heat was able to be generated and trapped in than the tall and skinny setup.",5
139541,David's claim is incorrect because the short and wide box heats up faster than the skinny and tall box. The short and wide box attained a temperature of 55 degrees Celsius whereas the skinny and tall box only reached 37 degrees Celsius in 4 minutes. Infrared radiation enters the box at a faster rate because it has a greater surface area so more molecules enter in and transfer heat. ,4
139497,David's claim is incorrect because the small opening for the tall and thin box does not allow as much heat energy in therefore will not heat up as much as the wide and short box.,4
139487,David's claim is incorrect because the wide and short solar oven model increased in temperature more than the skinny and tall model. The movement of energy in the wide and short model is able to move the energy around more compared to the tall model to heat up faster.,3
139826,"David's claim is incorrect because ... the wide and short oven allowed more solar radiation to enter the oven where as the skinny and tall oven allowed only a small amount of solar radiation to enter. The more solar radiation, the more heat was converted and the infrared radiation did not escape that much. With a skinny and tall oven there was less solar radiation, less heat, and overall not a lot of infrared radiation being generated. ",5
139493,"David's claim is incorrect, because the wide and short box was able to increase more in temperature than the tall and skinny box. The larger glass allows for more of the heat to be formed from the heat, thus increasing the average temperature of the box.",4
139513,David's claim is incorrect because he thought the skinny tall box will have smaller windows and the smaller windows will trap the heat more but what he didn't know was that smaller windows means less solar radiation are able to pass through and be absorbed.,4
139834,"David's claim is ...incorrect because ... the wide and short one allowed more radiation in, and because the radiation doesnt go out due to the wrap, it heated up faster.",4
139831,"David's claim is incorrect because the short and wide box heated up faster. The skinny and tall box and wide and short box both lets out infrared radiation from the heat, but not through the opening because of the barrier that retains heat. The skinny and tall box emits infrared radiation at a faster rate anyway, so he is still wrong. ",3
139516,David's claim is wrong because the short one has a wider space for the solar oven to collect the sun rays and then it keeps the heat in while the taller one has a smaller space to collect the energy,3
139836,David claim is incorrect because using a tall and skinny box does not really allow heat to penetrate through the box it also does not keep heat as good as the wide and short one. Having A wide and Short box will make it easy for the light rays to penetrate the box which will heat it faster.,3
139545,David's claim is incorrect because more radiation energy can enter than the tall and skinny box which didn't allow much to enter which meant less heat being able to heat the box.,3
139538,David's claim is incorrect because the short and wide one gained more heat over time compared to the tall and skinny box. More infrared rays get into the short and wide box rather than the tall and skinny. The opening was too small for the rays to get in so the tall and skinny box did not get much heat in.,3
139533,"David's claim is ...
incorrect
because ...
the wide and short box gained more heat than the tall and skinny box and actually released less heat than the tall and skinny box. ",3
140326,David's claim is incorrect because the short and wide box got hotter than the skinny and tall one. The energy in the short and wide box was moving at the bottom of the box as opposed to the tall and skinny box which had the energy moving at the side of the box. ,3
139543,David's claim is incorrect because the tall and long box got less sunlight while the other box got more sunlight thus more heat.,3
139534,"David's claim is incorrect because the temperature of the wide and short increased faster than the skinny and tall's temperature. The reason for this is because less heat is going inside the skinny and tall one since its top is smaller. The wide and short's surface area is bigger, so more heat is going in and  trapped inside. ",4
139861,David's claim is ... incorrect because ... when we tested it out the wide box heated up to 47 degrees after two minutes while the skinny box only heated up to 35 degrees. The wide oven allowed more radiation to come in which allowed the box to heat up faster.,4
139544,"David's claim is incorrect because according to the model, the wide and short box seemed to heat up much faster than the box that was tall and skinny. Based on the graph, the wide and short box had a steeper slope than the tall and skinny box meaning it heated up faster. Based on the model, the movement of the energy was happening much faster since it had such a wide window, it is able to let more of the solar radiation and the infrared radiation in compared to the skinny window which only allowed half of what the wide window allowed. The wider window gives more space for the radiation to be passed through and being trapped.",4
139864,David's claim is ... not correct because ... the short and skinny box only had a delta T of 16 degrees Celsius while the wid and short box had a delta T of 37.9 degrees Celsius so the short boc heated up faster,3
139542,"David's claim is incorrect because according to the graph, a box that is tall and skinny takes a longer amount of time to heat up compared to the box that is wide and short.",3
139479,"David's claim is wrong.
A wider opening means that more solar radiation can enter the box at any given time. Being shorter means that the solar and infrared radiation takes a shorter amount of time to be absorbed by the walls of the box.",4
139477,,1
139501,,1
139485,,1
139515,"David's claim is incorrect because using a short and wide box allows more solar radiation to hit the interior of the box. When more solar radiation hits the interior, more infrared radiation is reflected back into the box due to the film.",3
139514,"David's claim is incorrect because the short and wide oven allows more radiation inside than the tall and skinny oven. Therefore, skinny and tall oven would not heat up faster.",3
139509,"David's claim is no because the solar oven will have more surface area, which allows more light energy to enter the solar oven compared tall and skinny box.",4
139507,"David's claim is partly correct... because ... while he is right that less heat will be able to leave the box due to its small window, that also means that less radiation will be able to get inside since the window is so small. So since more radiation is able to enter the short and wide box, it gets a lot warmer a lot faster than the tall and skinny box.",4
139510,"David's claim is partly true because it does let less energy to leave, but it also lets less energy to enter.",2
139835,"David's claim is incorrect because as shown in the diagram and the graph, it is obvious that the short and wide box increased at a more rapid rate than the tall and skinny box as seen on the graph. Also, there were more solar radiation and infrared particles in the shorter box which can show that it retains heat better than the tall skinny box.",4
139517,"David's claim is incorrect because the wide and short box heated up faster than the tall and skinny box. This is because while the tall and skinny box lets less solar radiation in, it also doesn't let as much solar radiation in, which causes it not to heat up as fast as the wide and short box which lets a lot of solar radiation in.",4
139521,"David's claim is unsupported because the wide and short box contain more surface area for the glass that allow the solar radiation to go through and cover to heat, while the tall and skinny box have small surface area of glass for the solar radiation to go in, which less heat is obtained.",5
139526,David's claim is incorrect because the wide and short box had more surface area where solar radiation can hit. Which is why the temperature of the short and wide box increased at a faster rate. Since the box is wide there is more space for the solar radiation to hit and for heat to be captured. It is a shorter distance as it reflects off the bottom and cover of the oven.,4
139511,"David's claim is incorrect ... because ... he believed that the skinny and tall box would be more effective with the temperature, but the wide and short contained more area space and has more space to pick up the heat from the surface, allowing it to gain more temperature than the tall and skinny box. ",2
139506,David's claim is incorrect because the temperature in the short and wide box raised significantly greater than the tall and skinny box. Since the box is more open and exposed to sunlight it makes the solar radiation enter more easily. While the tall and skinny box has a hard time entering due to the fact that it is less exposed to the light.,4
139863,David's claim is ...incorrect because ... the tall and skinny box could not capture as much sunlight as the wide and short box since it was harder for the sunlight to go into the tall and skinny box.,3
139540,"David's claim is wrong, because the data shows that a wide and short box heats up faster than a skinny and tall box, it has a larger area and opening to absorb the heat.",4
139866,David's claim is incorrect because it is harder for the infrared radiation to reach the box. The sun will hit from an angle but not straight from below.,3
139539,David's claim is the skinny and tall will increase in temperature faster than the wide and short because skinny and tall will cover more in length than the wide and short which will cover more of width of the ground. The movement of energy increased the energy taken inside which will produce a greater outcome in heat.,3
139823,"David's claim is incorrect because the wide and short box have more surface area to collect light and heat, whereas the tall and narrow box have surface areas that won't collect light and heat as much as the former.",3
139535,"David's claim is incorrect because the shorter box was able to heat up faster than the taller box. The shorter box is able to trap radiation in the walls of the box more efficiently, as the radiation travels along the wider bottom length of the box to just beneath the surface of the covering of the oven, and is trapped back into the bottom surface until it is able to travel up the walls of the cardboard.",3
139862,,1
139537,David's claim is incorrect because the Short wide heats up faster because the the short and wide has more surface area where the solar radiation can hit and converted to Infrared radiation which the heat energy is transferred at a higher rate and causes the temperature to increase more rapidly. Than a small tall box which has less surface are that the solar radiation can hit on.,4
139832,David's claim is incorrect because the wide and short allows more light to enter in and traps in more infrared radiation causing the solar oven to heat up faster than the skinny and tall box.,4
139523,David's claim is incorrect because the wide and short temperature was higher than the tall and skinny because the wide and short had more surface area for the solar radiation to enter and thus this means it can trap in more heat thus making the temperature of the wide and short higher than the tall and skinny.,4
139833,David's claim is incorrect because the smaller and wider box allows for more radiation to come in. It also has a smaller surface area to heat up because it's not as tall so it will heat up faster. Energy circulates around the box faster due to convection. ,4
139519,"David's claim is incorrect because the opposite of what he claimed would happen happened. The short wide box heated up faster because in less time, the temperature increased faster. This happened because a larger surface area allows more solar radiation to pass through into the solar oven, meaning there's more heat conversion taking place. Since there's more heat trapped inside the oven, this will result in a great temperature increase versus the smaller surface area letting little solar radiation in.",5
139505,"David's claim is incorrect because skinny and tall box clearly increased less in temperature than the wide and short box. In addition the skinny and tall box has less surface area on the opening of the box which allows less solar radiation inside the box, resulting in a lower temperature increase. The amount of radiation and conduction on the tall and skinny box is lower as a result and the short and wide box gets hotter with more energy from the sun.",4
139483,David's claim is incorrect because we can see that the tall and skinny box increase less in temperature compared to the wide and short box. This is because the short box had more glass which allowed for more solar radiation to enter and heat up the box compared to the skinny one.,4
139496,David's claim is incorrect because a solar oven that is skinny and tall create shadows and increase heat loss. The most successful solar oven is wide and short because they intercept more sunlight; therefore it will heat up faster.,4
139489,David's claim is wrong because the short and wide box's temperature increased more than the skinny and tall's temperature. This happened because the short and wide box has more surface area on the bottom than that of the skinny and tall one causing more heat produced in the short and wide box.,3
139494,"David's claim is incorrect because the wide and short box's temperature increased faster after 2 minutes. The movement of energy causes one solar oven to heat up faster than the other because their is a wider space for the heat to enter and be trapped, thus letting less energy leave the oven. ",3
139518,"David's claim is incorrect because the solar radiation was able to to take more space up in the wide and short box.  More was able to enter.  Therefore, more heat was produced compared to that of the skinny and tall box.",4
139525,David's claim is incorrect because the wide and short box retained more heat.,3
139520,"David's claim is incorrect because the short and wide oven had more solar and infrared radiation from the sun, therefore the skinny and tall oven will not heat up faster.",3
139527,David's claim is incorrect because a tall and skinny box receives less solar radiation than a wide and short box.,3
139508,David's claim is incorrect because there were more infrared particles trapped inside the box in the short and wide box since more infrared radiation is able to enter the box. The short and wide box also heated up faster because of more infrared radiation that is able to enter the box.,4
139524,David's claim is incorrect because the skinny and tall one did not heat up as quickly as the short and wide one. ,3
139528,,1
139522,David's claim is incorrect because he claimed that the tall and skinny one would heat up faster but that is wrong because the short and wide one accepts more radiation which then heats up faster.,3
139824,"David's claim is incorrect because although the window is smaller and energy leaves slower, it's harder for the energy or heat to go into the box because it's so tall and skinny. In the tall and skinny oven, heat took longer to travel into the box.",3
139482,,1
139480,"David's claim is partly correct  because the principle that less heat would leave is some what correct. However, he is incorrect in the sense that the wide and short box would allow more heat in and would leave room for more effective convection within the box, leading to the box heating up faster. ",4
139828,David's claim is incorrect because the wide and short box has more surface area so more heat is trapped in the box. ,3
139492,"David's claim is incorrect because the glass traps heat energy from the sun inside the oven, so the solar oven with the largest window heats up faster than the other. ",4
139829,David's claim is incorrect... because ... he did not test out his claim. The light does not have enough space to enter the tall and skinny box because of the small opening. Compared to the wide box the sun rays easily get captured inside the box making the temperature increase.,4
139481,,1
139827,,1
139800,"David's claim is ... wrong because ... the wide and short oven heated up faster because it allowed more solar radiation to enter, while the other skinny one only allowed some radiation to enter, it had less heat and less infrared radiation. more radiation means that more heat is converted ",5
139488,"David's claim is incorrect because ... in the tall and skinny box, very little uv rays were able to enter the box, which led to his box never heating up as much in the first place. In the wide and short box, more uv rays are able to enter the box, allowing it to heat up faster.",4
139495,David's claim is incorrect because the short and wide model was warmer than the tall and skinny model. The short and wide model also gained a constant temperature growth while the tall and skinny model had a set temperature at its hottest point. The short and wide model has more room and a bigger open area to let the light energy in and the tall and skinny model had little place for the light energy to enter the box.,4
139785,"David's claim is incorrect, because from the data from the graph, the short and wide box is able to rise in temperature faster than the skinny and tall box. From the diagram, more sunlight is able to enter into the wide and short box while for the tall and skinny box, sunlight is having trouble entering into the box.",4
139769,David's claim is partly correct because the wide box reached the same temperature at 2 mins because the movement of energy was the same.,3
139819,"David's claim is wrong because it absorbed less heat, meaning that even if it loses less heat over time, at the same time it doesn't absorb enough heat",3
139796,,1
139803,,1
139643,David's claim is incorrect because the wide and short oven has a greater surface area for the sun's energy to hit causing it to heat up to a higher temperature at a faster rate compared to the tall and skinny oven. The wide and short oven allowed more energy to reach the inside of the oven as the opening was greater so it was able to heat up faster. ,4
139802,,1
139842,,1
139845,"David's claim is incorrect because base on the experiment, I see that the wide and short one is heat up faster because more energy can get into the box. The shinny and tall box use 1.8 mins to heat up to 28 degrees, and the wide and short box used 1.6 mins to heat up to 32 degrees.",3
139846,,1
139561,David's claim is incorrect because there was more energy entered into the short and wide box which means more energy was able to spread out to the system and heat it up faster than short and skinny box because the tall and skinny box allowed less heat to be entered because of its narrow window so it took longer for the system to heat up. ,4
139798,"David's claim is ...incorrect because ... the wide and short one would heat up quicker, because it is wider, so more sun rays would go through, and it is shorter so it will heat up quicker than if it was tall.",4
139870,"David's claim is ...incorrect because ...The more space the box offers for radiation to come into it,the more heat it will receive in a shorter amount of time.",4
139838,David's claim is incorrect because the more space the box offers for radiation to come into it the more heat it will receive in a shorter amount of time.,3
140093,David's claim is incorrect because at 2 minutes for the tall and skinny it was @34.1 and @ the same time for wide and short it was above 47 degrees. Since the movement it was constantly moving in th short and wide it was able to capture the heat causing it to heat up since it did not have to go all the way to the top as much.,3
139840,David's claim is incorrect because based on our data the wide box had more space so that means it was easier for the solar radiation to bounce in and out so that means it'll hold more heat faster.,2
139875,David's claim is incorrect... because ... The taller and skinnier the oven the longer it is going to take to heat it up. For the wider and smaller solar oven it is faster because it is more open and has more space.,3
139806,David's claim is incorrect because the short and wide box has higher temp than the tall and skinny box at 2 min. this is because wide and short box can receive more sunlight.,3

139809,David's claim is incorrect because the skinny box doesnt let as much heat in than the wider one,3
139814,David's claim is incorrect because the wide and short box-shape heated up faster than the skinny and tall box-shape. There was much more solar radiation going and heat staying in the wide and short bow-shape than the skinny and tall box-shape.,3
139795,,1
139816,,1
139812,David's claim is incorrect... because ... the wide and shorter oven heats up faster than the tall and skinny one. Both in two minutes you can see the difference.,3
139782,David's claim is incorrect because the wide and short boxes can take up more of the heat which makes that heat up faster and burn it fast.,2
140712,,1
139529,,1
139801,David's claim is wrong because the wide one had picked up more heat faster than the tall one in my evidence. Also it would seem that the wide one collects more energy than the skinny one then allowing it to heat up faster than the other.,4
139774,David's claim is partly right and correct because for the skinny and tall it increases but it makes a big decrease but for wide and short it all increases.,2
139790,"David's claim is wrong because the wider and shorter one had more opening space for the heat to be absorbed, the heat was easily absorbed. Whereas the skinny and tall one, it's hard for heat to go in because it's not wide enough.",4

139815,"David's claim is incorrect because in the demonstration, the skinny and tall box looses heat energy faster because it does not absorb since it has less space for the rays to enter.",3
139817,David's claim is wrong because in the skinny and tall one the heat is being taken in but because its skinny not as much solar radiation is being taken in. in the short and wide one the oven is taking in more solar radiation because of its wider sides. so as more solar radiation hits it the more it turns into heat and that is why david's claim is wrong.,3
139787,David's claim is wrong because the wide ans short got higher in temp on the graph faster than the skinny and tall ,3
139799,David's claim is incorrect... because ... the wide box heated up faster.,3
139785,"David's claim is incorrect because from the data, the wide and short box increased to 30 degrees within less than a minute whereas the tall and skinny box increased to 30 degrees in over a minute.",4
139845,,1
140093,David's claim is incorrect because the temperature for the short and wide is higher than the skinny and tall by almost 10 degrees which is not that close. ,3
139808,David's claim is was completely wrong because the skinny long box opening was too small not allowing sun light to go inside. That why its better to use the wide box because it has more of a bigger window for the sun light to in.,4
139816,Davids claim is incorrect because the small wide box allows more sunlight to enter to create more heat which helps the whole box heat up faster compared to the skinny tall box.,4
139819,"David's claim is incorrect because it absorbed less heat, meaning that even if it loses less heat over time, at the same time it doesn't absorb enough heat",4
139782,"David's claim is somewhat correct because the smaller box did have more heat being absorbed then the skinny box, but the smaller box was getting heat much faster then the skinny box.",3
139787,David's claim is wrong because the wide and short box got hotter way quicker than the other one,3
139769,David's claim is partly correct because the movement of energy was easier to get into the box than the skinny tall one.,3
139809,David's claim is incorrect because it is harder for heat to enter a skinnier box,3
139556,David's claim is incorrect because the wide and short box increased in heat more rapidly than the skinny and tall box. His claim was proven incorrect because the wide and short box has less to warm up even though it is wide. It is harder for molecules of heat to vibrate and bounce up and down rather than side to side.,3
139812,David's claim is incorrect because its wide and short which increased faster.,3
139529,David's claim is wrong because the solar radiation for skinny and tall didn't enter enought because it ain't wide enough to let it the ovem,4
139815,"David's claim is incorrect, because the small and wide box, allows more radiation to enter the box. WHile the  skinny and tall box does not allow easy access.",3
139817,David's claim is wrong because the short and wide box is getting more heat in because it has a wider space ,3
139806,"David's claim is partly incorrect  because the short and wide box reached the higher temperature than the skinny and tall box, in 2min. Part of his claim is suppose to be correct because smaller opening is disadvantage for convection, which can reduce the convection. But the wide and short box has more area can touch the sunlight, which means it can absorb more heat.",5
139561,"David's claim is incorrect because short and wider box's temper increased more and faster than tall and skinny since short and wider box have bigger surface area, it's easier for heat to enter the system",4
139841,David's claim is ... incorrect because ... the wide and short box heated up faster than the tall and skinny box,3
139775,David's claim is wrong because a wider and shorter box allows more heat for the box to get.,3
139844,David's claim is ... wrong  because ... the wide and short box was quicker to heat up do the space.,3
139856,David's claim is ... incorrect because ... the short and wide box increased more.,3
139840,David's claim is incorrect... because ... the skinny and tall box took longer to heat up. Since the short box had more space it was easier to heat up,3
139875,David's claim is incorrect... because ... the skinny and tall box heated up more slower than the wide and short box. Since the wide and short box had more space it was easier to heat up the oven than the tall and skinny one.,3
139839,David's claim is incorrect because the wide and short box will heat up faster because the energy won't have to travel far down like how it would have to for a skinny and tall box.,4
139768,"David's claim is partly true because both variations ever so slightly heat up faster than the other, the wide/short only heated up slighly faster",3
139855,David's claim is incorrect because wide and short box heats up faster than the skinny and tall box because it can trap more heat and there is less space in a wide and short box so it is secure.,3
139778,"David's claim is incorrect because the wide and short box was able to gain and retain it's heat much more faster and better than the tall and skinny box. The wide and short box was able to allow more sunlight to travel inwards, then converting into heat enery, while less sunlight was able to travel in, creating less energy.

139869,,1
139847,David's claim is incorrect because he did not account for amount of energy gained vs amount lost. Basicly with a larger window you get more energy and the window kept infrared radiation in better.,5
139879,,1
139853,David's claim is . incorrect  because  the graph shows that wide and short heats faster,3
139747,"David's claim is incorrect because Skinny and Tall box can't really harness that much sun light because the opening is very narrow, unlike the  Wide and Short, it has wide opening where it can harness as much sun light it needs.",4
139774,David's claim is incorrect because it heats up faster in a wide and short box because it can trap more heat easily and theres less space in the box.,3
153824,"David's claim is partly correct because he is seaking the truth  when he says that less heat will be leaving the skinny and tall oven, but it is not true that the skinny and tall oven will produce more heat than the wide and short oven. The movement of the solar radiation  is more spread out than close together. Therefore, the skinny and tall oven is not going to collect as much solar radiation as the wide and short oven.",4
153822,David's claim is ... wrong because ... On the graph it showed that the skinny and tall box the temp stayed low but the short and wide one temp went high right away.,3
153844,David's claim is WRONG because in the computer model it showed how much the temp was rising and with the skinny and tall one the temp did not rise but it did with the wide and short one.,3
153852,David's claim is incorrect... because ... the box that's skinny and tall have slower process then the short and wide box.,3
153838,David's answer is partly correct because on  the short an wide box was 49.7 an on skinny an it was an on 2.5 it was 36.5,3
155053,David's claim is wrong because there is less space for sunlight to get in so it would heat up less.,4
153831,David's claim is wrong because he said the skinny and tall would get  hotter than the wide and short.,2
153816,David's claim is incorrect because most of the heat bounces off the sides on a tall and skinny box.,3
153823,David's claim is incorrect because he said that the tall and skinny penis solar oven would collect more energy when the wide and short solar oven collected more energy.,3
153837,David's claim is wrong because he said that the tall and skinny box would heat up faster because it's smaller and actually the wide and short box heated up faster. The solar radiation comes off the sun and goes into the oven and then the radiation turns into heat cells.,4
153864,David's claim is incorrect  because at 4 minutes the wide and short box was at at 58 degrees C and with the tall and skinny box at 4 minutes was at 56 degrees C,3
153923,David's claim is incorrect because the wide and short got warmer faster.,3
153928,David's claim is wrong because the skinny and tall may have a small opening to gather energy and keep t inside but it takes longer time to gather all the radiation because of the small opening. The wide and short thought will heat up faster because the opening is much bigger and more sun rays and radiation can get inside to heat the box faster. So as a conclusion the wide and short will heat up faster but the skinny and tall will heat up but take longer to.,
153909,"David's claim is incorrect because, the wide and short box actually increases much faster then the skinny and tall box does. This is because when the light reaches the box it spreads the sun rays into different areas of the box which causes to heat up faster.",
153913,David's claim is ... because ...the heat reflects to small things I think?,2
153917,David's claim is ... because ...it was not what he was thinking about.,2
153916,David's claim is wrong because the wide and short box heats up faster. The skinny and tall heated up 18.5 degrees and the wide and short heated up 39.1 degrees. The wide and short is more open than the skinny and tall so more heat can enter it and stay trapped inside.,4
153935,David's claim is ... because ... the wide and short was his observation and he was write because that one was the hottest by far.,2
153922,David's claim is incorrect ... because ...the short and wide got to 62.7 and the long and tall got 40.7,3
153921,David's claim is partly correct because yes the window is small so no heat can get out but since the window is small it doesn't allow a lot of heat to get inside of the box.,3
153934,David's claim is ... because ...  inocorrect,2
153911,David's claim is wrong because if you look at the wid and short model heated up faster than skinny and tall,3
153930,David's claim is wrong because I know that the wide and short oven will heat up faster because more heat goes because it is wider.,4
154112,David's claim is incorrect because if you use the tall and short box you have to go deep and fill it up because you can't just have it on the top because thermometer is on the bottom.,2
153926,David's claim is partly correct and incorrect because he said the tall and skinny would heat up faster.. It doe heat up faster but the wide and short is hotter then the tall and skinny.,2
153908,David's claim is partly correct because although tall and skinny did heat up faster it didn't stay with a rising temp. Unlike wide and short which took longer to heat up but overall got hotter than tall and skinny. The movement of energy  causes one to heat up faster because the heat could have rose.,3
153905,"David's claim is incorrect, because in the models shown above, you see that the temperature in the wide and short rises faster and stays hotter. There is more sunlight rays entering than the purple arrows leaving, making it clear that the dots represent the heat brought in by the sunlight rays and taken out by the purple rays. If there are more dots, than it is a hotter oven.",5
153918,David's claim is ... because ... the wide an short one got hotter faster,3
153906,David's claim is correct ... because ... the wide and short oven did heat up faster than the Tall and skinny,2
153919,Davids claim was that the skinny and tall box would heat up quicker because the window is smaller so less energy can get out.,3

153927,David's claim is not correct because the short and wide heats up faster,3
154135,David's claim is ... not correct  because ... the skinny and tall one did not get much more heat than the other one,2
154124,"David's claim is incorrect partly because the window does not let heat escape, but it also does not let heat get in either.",3
154132,David's claim is  incorect... because ...the heat did not leave and the wide and short trapped heat which made it hotter.,3
154162,David's claim is ... because ...wrong because the skinny and tall was less than the wide and short.,2
154134,David's claim is incorrect  because the shot and wide box had a much bigger increase in temperature than the skinny and tall.,3
154153,David's claim is wrong because The wide short heat up fasster.,3
154118,David's claim is wrong. the short and wide oven lets more sunlight in which will heat up the oven faster. the shinny and tall oven does not allow as much sunlight as wide and short oven.,4
154155,"David's claim is wrong ... because ... it  didnt heat up faster because the widow [opening] is too small, so it would not catch as much as the box with the wider window.",3
154119,David's claim is wrong because skinny and tall got close to 40 degrees Celsius and wide and short got about 55 degrees Celsius after 5 minutes. The skinny and tall doesn't warm up as fast because it doesn't have as wide area as the wide and short box. Some of the heat doesn't go into the box because it is too skinny.,3
154163,David's claim is ... because ...I think went it get hot it will be.,2
154130,David's claim is wrong because he thought that it would go higher than skinny and tall.,2
154150,David's claim is ... because ... the wide and short could keep in more heat and the skinny and sort ha a fats time but it had a bad Celsius temperature.,2
154122,David's claim is wrong because Wide an Short has more space to tavel from one place to other and would also make more hot,2
154127,"David's claim is incorrect because since the skinny and tall box is so tall, some of the sun rays miss the box or rebound off the sides of the box while the sun rays go into the wide and short box.",4
154143,David's claim is correct because when i tried it went up a lot,2
154128,David's claim is wrong because I stopped both boxes at 5 minutes and the short and wide box got to 62.5 degrees C while the tall and skinny box  got 39.1 degrees C.,3
154141,David's claim is wrong because the tall and skinny box has a smaller opening so less sun radiation can go in.,3
154145,David's claim is incorrect because the vapor or air helps the sun heat up faster and the skinny and tall box doesn't have a lot of vapor.,2
154208,David's claim is incorrect because over a ten minute time wide and short heated more because it had a larger opening for heat to come in. There is more room for heat to spread.,4
154202,"David's claim is partly correct because the skinny and tall box trapped more heat, but less heat came in. This made the short and wide box a better choice.",3
154193,David's claim is wrong ... because ...the tall and skinny has less space to let the heat in so the wide and skinny has more space to let th box heat up quicker.,2
154200,David's claim is incorrect because it took less time for the heat of the sun to reach the box.,3
154206,David's claim is wrong because the wide and short box had a wider opening to receive more solar radiaton.,4
154224,David's claim is wrong because wide and short had an increase of 30 and tall and skinny had an increase of 20.,3
154212,David's claim is partly correct  ... because ... the tall and skinny box is fast but does not go very high and the wide and short is slower but has a higher temputure.,3
154214,David's claim is incorrect because the wide and short model heats up faster than the tall and skinny oven. the wide and short oven allows radiation to come in side of the solar oven and the skinny and tall oven doesn't allow as much radiation to come in.,4
154216,David's claim is wrong because of the sun's heat so the wide and short store the heat.,2
154218,David's claim is ... because ... well i think Davids claim is incorrect because the graph showed that the short and wide one is better and on the graph it went way higher for the wide and short one so he is incorrect.,3
154221,David's claim is incorrect because The short and wide model allows more heat to get in.,3
154226,David's claim is incorrect because in the skinny an tall one it was 40 degrees but in the wide and short one it was 56.6 degrees.,3
154217,David's claim is ... because ...long and sort heats up faster if it was tall and skinny than that gets lower heat than small and skinny,3
154220,David's claim is ... because ... David's claim is wrong because the the skinny and tall box will get less energy into the box because the window is tiny.,4
154199,David's claim is incorrect because a short and wide box heats up faster because the tall and skinny in 5 minutes got to 37 degrees celsius and short and wide box got to 55 degrees celsius.,3
154198,David's claim is incorrect because the model showed that the wide and short box heated up more than the other one,3
154215,David's claim is incorrect because the short and wide one is wider which can carry more heat and also because it has a bigger window so the sun can reflect a lot of heat in the box.,4
154196,David's claim is wrong because the short in wide got hotter than the tall and short by about 20 deg Celsius in the fist 5 minutes and in 10 minutes the wide and short went higher than the tall and skinny by 50 deg Celsius.,3
154201,David's claim is wrong because the wide and short has a very small space which will make it easy for the heat to be stuffed in and make it really hot.,2
154205,David's claim is ... because ... the wide and short box will be more easier for heat to get in the box and less to get and the box will heat up faster.,3
154197,David's claim is incorrect because the short and flat box got hotter than the tall and skinny box. The movement of energy affects the heat because the rays move around collecting heat.,3
154204,David's claim is incorrect because tall and skinny is not the best wide and short is because there is less ground to cover.,2
154195,"David's claim is partly correct because the tall and skinny box does allow less energy to leave because the the top of it is small. However, the tall and skinny box allows less energy to enter because of the small top. This causes the tall and skinny box to not work as well as the fat and short one, which heats up better because more energy is let in.",5
154311,David's claim is incorect ... because ... the box donsn't have that much space to spread,2
154322,"David's claim is ... because ...
David's claim is correct because on the computer model it showed that the wide and short oven got 56 degrees higher in 5 minutes. the wide and short box showed more movement of energy in the oven because more heat would be at the bottom of the oven and since the skinny and tall oven does not have that much space on the bottom but the wide and short one does so that is why his prediction is correct.",2
154310,David's claim is wrong because ...the radation can go in  but if it has a small window it might miss and a wide one its not going to miss.,3
154327,David's claim is partly correct because the heat did have trouble escaping but it also had trouble escaping.,3
154342,David's claim is partly correct  because ... the times of both of the ovens were the same at one point in the time they are testing the box.What i am saying is it depends how long David leaves his box out for,2
154326,David's claim is incorrect ... because ... the short and wide box increased more. The reason that happens is that the heat can bounce of of the card board.,3
154324,David's claim is partly correct because it kept the heat in better but it was hard to get the heat in because the opening was smaller.,4
154319,David's claim is wrong because while the skinny and short box he voted hit only short of 40 c the wide and short box hit 60 c and sometimes went over that by a little bit and using evidence the graph the skinny and short was showed at 38 c at 5 minutes while the wide and short was at 60 c at 5 minutes and the movement of energy heated up the wide and short more because more heat was going inside the wide and short while in the skinny and tall it only had a small hole for heat to get into.,4
154343,David's claim is incorrect because the wide and short got more heat every were but the tall and thin only got heat at the top and not at the bottem were the termomiter is in the box,3
154307,David's claim is incorrect because he thought that the skinny and tall would heat up faster but the wide and short headed up faster. In 12.83 the wide and short heated up 61 degrees C. The skinny and tall heated up 38 degrees C in 12.81. The wide and short would heat up faster because since box is wide then the heat can evaporate. While the skinny and tall would take a long time to heat up because since it is tall then the heat would take longer to rise.,3
154371,David's claim is wrong because the wide and short had more space to let in the heat in,3
154353,David's claim is wrong  because David  was using he one with less heat,2
154336,David's claim is ... right because  the skiny and tall one is long and the heat stars surcuing around,2
154325,David's claim is incorrect because radiation will enter a box that is wide quicker because of how it takes up a lot of space so while it is absorbing heat the skinny and tall one will absorb less heat because it is having trouble getting the heat inside the box.,4
154329,David's claim is correct because when the sunray hits the inside of the box i turns into heat when it stimulates inside the box.,3
154323,David's claim is rong because the tal and skinny has to travelly all the way down,2
154345,David's claim is incorrect because the skinny and all will not get more heat than the wide and short. Its like that because the wide and short will gather more heat and it has a wider surface are that the skinny and tall.,3
154703,David's claim is partly right because the skinny and tall was slow to heat up but the short and tall was  faster to heat up and they where both the same time ending.,3
155334,David's claim is incorrect  because tall and thin is less hot as wide and short and wide and short is more hotter and it can absorb more sun light.,4
153836,David's claim is incorrect because though the surface area is smaller it lets in less heat and it does not matter what size the box is when it comes to keeping heat in but what the material over the box is.,3
153834,David's claim is incorrect because the skinny and tall box takes up less space so the solar radiation will less likely hit the box while the wide and short box takes up more ground space having the solar radiation likely to hit the box.,4
153863,David's claim is incorrect because When its shot and wide it heats up faster than the tall and skinny.,3
153843,David's claim is incorrect because he said that skinny and tall box would heat up faster it didn't,2
153826,David's claim is incorrect because the inside of the box heated up faster when I used the computer model.,2
153856,"David's claim is incorrect ,because wide and short has better results than skinny and tall.The graph showed that the wide and short gt more heat than skinny and tall.",3
153848,"David's claim is incorrect because the surface area is too small in a skinny and tall box. If someone did a skinny and tall box then, it would be much harder to attract heat to the item.",2
153835,"David's claim is wrong ... because ...the skinny and tall box has a small foundation so not many sun rays can fit in the box , so there won't be as much heat in the box.",3
153860,David's claim is incorrect  because on the graph the short and wide box heated up more in the same amount of time as the skinny and tall box. More energy was trapped in the wide and short box than the skinny and tall.,4
153827,David's claim is wrong because yes he is right about heat not leaving the box but since the space where the radiation  is going through is small NOT as much radiation is going in side of the box.,3
153830,"David's claim is incorrect because the since the skinny and tall box has such narrow space, radiation just keeps bouncing until it leaps out of the box. The wide and short box has a larger space so the radiation can spread around and heat the box up faster. The heat also has a bigger surface to heat up.",3
154514,David's claim is Wrong because the skinny and tall has less room for the suns rays to hit.,3
153859,David's claim is ... because the wide and short get more sun rays,3
153832,David's claim is incorect because the heat does not easly get into a skinny and tall box because the opening is to small the wise and short is better because more heat comes into it.,3
153854,I think the wide and short one would heat up faster because there is less space to heat up so the heat will spread quicker Thanh the skinny and tall one.,2
153839,David's claim is not correct  because at 2.5 minutes the wide and short box was at 50.1 degrees and the skinny an tall box is at 34.7 degrees at 2.5 minutes. The wide and short box heats up faster than the skinny and tall box because it has a better chance of the light hitting the box.,4
153818,"David's claim is incorrect because the wide and short box heated up to a higher temperature than the skinny and tall box. Energy still escapes through the sides, and less radiation can enter through the clear top.",4
153915,he is incorrect because wide and short heated up faster than skinny and tall.,3
153925,David's claim is .incorrect.. because the wide and skinny one had hat mollacules get suc on the bottom. ...,2
153912,He is incorrect because,2
153924,David's claim is ...wrong  because ... The one  that got hotter was the wide and short because it when all the way up to 60,3
153936,David's claim is incorrect because i do it in the solar oven speed and i pick wide and short it got hot faster,3
154148,David's claim is incorret because since tall and skinny has a less big area than wide and short it didnt collect that much heat.,2
154152,David's claim is partly because it deepens  the temperature when he doe it.,2
154160,David's claim is incorrect  because when I checked in the graph less heat went inside.,3
154157,David's claim is correct  because the smaller it is its hotter.,2
154147,David's claim is wrong because The skinny and tall heats up slower because the window is to small for the heat and solar radiation to get through.,4
154159,David's claim is incorect because in the model it shows that short and wide gathers more heat than tall and skinny.,3
154161,David's claim is incorrect because if you look at the writing that i did in the top the wide and short gets more heat than the just the outside of the box.,3
154146,David's claim is wrong because wen you get tall and skinny it will take time for it to heat up faster than they short and wide.,3
154211,David's claim is wrong because there is a smaller opening for the heat to come through.,3
154210,"David's claim is wrong because  the tall and skinny box only covers  a little bit of area and doesn't heat up a lot, on the other hand the wide and short box covers  lot of are and heats up fast and high.",3
154321,David's claim is incorrect because the wide and short one lets more heat inside the box and doesn't let as much heat out either. The movement of energy causes the wide and short box to heat up faster because the more heat that gets inside of the box the hotter it gets so the wider the box the more heat gets inside so when the heat moves around inside the wide box the heat will go all around the box which causes the box to get hotter.,4
154318,David's claim is incorrect because in the graph wide an short got hotter then skinny and tal,3
154330,David's claim incorrect because the tall and skinny box got hotter than the shot and wide box,2
154194,David's claim is partly correct because the short and wide box does heat up faster but lets out more energy than the skinny and tall.,3
153816,"David's claim is partially incorrect because the tall box lets in less sun as well as letting it out, as the solar radiation bounces of the sides of the box.",3
153818,David's claim is incorrect because the short and wide model heated up to a higher temperature. The wide model has more area for the sun to heat up.,3
153822,David's claim is ... that the skinny and tall box worked better  ...because since there is a tiny window for the box less air would leave.,2
153823,David's claim is incorrect because he said that the tall and skinny solar oven would collect more energy when the wide and short solar oven collected more energy.,3
153824,"David's claim is incorrect because since the tall and skinny oven is really skinny, the solar radiation misses the oven very often, which slows down the heat production by a tenfold.  The wide and short oven worked better because since it was wide, the solar radiation hit it many more times, making the heat production faster.",5
153826,David's claim is incorrect because in the model wide and short works better because the temperature rises a lot faster.,3
153827,David's claim is incorrect because if it takes 0.73 minutes to get to 30 degrees Celsius for the wide and short oven and 2.12 minutes to get to 30 degrees Celsius i have inferred that it doesn't matter  if there is more Infrared Radiation oming out if the oven it matters if there is a lot of Solar Radiation coming in to he oven.,4
153830,"David's claim is incorrect because he thinks that if the skinny and tall box has a smaller window, it will let less energy leave the oven. I don't think he realized that since there is such a narrow space because it's a skinny"" box which makes the infrared radiation bounce and bounce until it finally makes it out of the box. The wide and short one heats up faster because the bottom surface is gathering all the heat to make it really warm. While the skinny and tall box takes heat for the walls since it is so tall instead of the small surface area at the bottom.""",3
153831,David's claim is incorrect because the wide and short heats up the fastest.,3
153832,"David's claim is incorrect because he thinks that because it has a small window less can leave, that is corect bur less can come in to.",3
153834,David's claim is incorrect because the heat inside the skinny and tall box it's harder for heat to stay in there because the box is tall and it will tak longer for heat to get to the bottom.,2
153835,David's claim is wrong because ith thhe tall and skinny box the sunry and heat has a hardy time getting to the box while it is easier to have sunrays get into a large foundation,3
153836,David's claim is incorrect because less heat stayed in the box in the skinny and tall box.,3
153837,David's claim is incorrect because the tall and skinny oven toke around 7 minutes to only get to 41 degrees Celsius and the wide and short oven went up to around 60 degrees Celsius in pretty much the same amount of time. In the wide and short box the Solar Radiation came down into the box and automatically changed into Infrared Radiation which then transferred to heat cells.,4
153838,David's claim is right because the skinny an long box went faster than the short an wide box in tempureture an minutes,2
153839,David's claim is incorrect because the short and wide box has more power from the sun and if he used the other box it would only get heated  up from the sides.,3
153843,David's claim is incorrect because heat stayed in the skinny and tall box,2
153844,David's claim is wrong because the heat would have to go all the way up but if you ha the short and wide one it only has to go across.,2
153848,"David's claim is partly correct because it heated up faster but, then it stayed at a temperature and slowly moved.",2
153852,"David's claim is correct... because ... the line, is showing the same numbers there is on the graph.",2
153854,David is incorrect the taller one takes longer to heat up because the heat takes longer to rises because it is taller so the shorter one will heat up faster.,3
153856,David's claim is partly right  because in the results of the graph the mostly  have the same heat.I did the speed really high and they both had same exact heat.,2
153859,David's claim is ... because ... David's clam is incorrect because there is more of a chanse of caching more heat and if you speed it up then you can see the differnts,3
153860,David's claim is correct because it took less time to heat up the skinny and tall box than it did the short and wide box. The movement for the skinny and tall box went faster causing it to heat up faster,2
153863,David's claim is incorrect because when it skinny and tall it get less sun into the box. Also when the box is short and wide it heats up faster.,4
153864,David's claim is that the skinny and tall box heats up faster but he is wrong because th wide nd shrt box heats up faster and it does that because it has a bigger space for the heat and i.r to come in.,4
153865,"David's claim is incorrect because the box needs a giant opening to let in a lot of sunlight. THe sunlight heats up the interior of the oven, w",4
153905,"David's claim is incorrect, because looking at the model above, I see that it rises quicker and longer in the wide and short. There is more sunlight rays entering than the purple arrows leaving, making it clear that the dots represent the heat brought in by the sunlight rays and taken out by the purple rays. If there are more dots, than it is a hotter oven.",4
153906,David's claim is wrong... because ... When it's tall and skinny the sun reaches it faster but has a small place for the sunlight to go into but the wide and short box has a big space for the sun to heat up around inside,3
153908,David's claim is partly correct because although tall and skinny did heat up faster it didn't stay with a rising temp. Unlike wide and short which took longer to heat up but overall got hotter than tall and skinny. The movement of energy  causes one to heat up faster because the heat could have rose. --------------,3
153909,David's claim is wrong because the wide one was way faster the the skinny box.,3
153910,David's claim is wrong because the tall and short box kept heating up then going down.,2
153911,David's claim is wrong because ... if you look at the model the wide and short traps more heat quicker than skinny and tall,3
153913,David's claim is wrong because when the short and wide is better because more of the heat comes in.,3
153914,"David's claim is incorrect because the wide and short heats up really fast, and then stay the same temperature for a while. The skinny and tall one heats up to about the same temperature as the wide and short one, but takes about  two times the amount of time of the wide and short one.",3
153915,David's claim is ... because ...partly correct becaue it heated up faster,2
153916,"David's claim is correct because if you use the skinny and tall solar oven more heat will be trapped in than get out, so as more heat keeps on coming in, the temperature keeps increasing like in the graph. The wide and short wouldn't be that successful because even though it can trap heat, the heat can escape easier because the opening of the solar oven is very big and wide.",2
153917,David's claim is partly correct because it is almost the same thing,2
153918,David's claim is true ... because ...the skinny and tall one got hotter faster,2
153919,David's claim is incorrect because ...The long and skinny graph collected less because where the short and big box had a biger entry point for the sun ray the long and skinny box had less area for it,3
153921,"David's claim is partly correct  because there is less energy leaving,, but the wide and short box heated up faster and it was hotter.",3
153922,David's claim is ...partly correct an partly incorrect  because ... the thin and tall boxes heat whas about the same heat as the short and wide box,2
153923,David's claim is incorrect because in the model it showed that the short and wide warmed up faster because it is wide so more sun radiation to come in and warm up faster.,4
153924,David's claim is ... because ...it not going fast it goinjslow,2
153925,David's claim is correct... because ...the wide and short one has a lot of space so it has clean air.,2
153926,David's claim is incorrect because the tall and skinny heats up quickly and goes to 37.4 but then the wide and short heats up slowly and goes to 60. Even though the tall and skinny heats up fast the wide and short is hotter.,3
153927,David's claim is incorrect because the short and wide one fills up faster and the skiny and tall one gose slower,3
153928,David's claim is wrong because since the opening is smaller less heat can get inside compared to the wider oven. The wider oven can get more heat.,4
153929,David's claim is incorrect because the short can build up more because it has less to heat farther away from the sun.,2
153930,David's claim is partly correct because they are both the same.,2
153931,David's claim is ... because ... the heat couldnt get out because it was skin and tall so the heat couldnt get out but with the wide and short the heat could get out,2
153933,David's claim is partly correct because the boxes are the same.,2
153934,,1
153935,David's claim is correct because ...when I did the test to see which one could heat up faster the skinny and tall one heated up way faster then the wide and short oven. David's observation was that the skinny and tall one would heat up faster and he was right.,2
153936,David's claim is because from mobei,1
154112,David's claim is incorect because when it is short and wide the degreese goes up faster because it has less room from going up to down.,3
154118,David's claim is ... because ... there was more sunlight coming into the box and that allowed more heat,3
154119,David's claim is incorrect.. because ... none of them heat up any faster.,2
154122,David's claim is wrong because the big oven has more space for the solar energy and heat to travel and connect.,2
154124,David's claim is incorrect because... I really don't know,2
154127,"David's claim is incorrect because since one box is wider, it can catch more sun rays because it cover more ground",3
154128,David's claim is wrong because it took it took 3.85 minutes to get to the highest temp. 39.5 for the skinny and tall box while for the fat and short box it only took 1.77 to get 42.5 degrees which isn't even the highest temp.,3
154130,David's claim is correct because it heats up faster,2
154132,David's claim is correct. because on the tall and skinny box the heat is rising up faster and the heat takes longer to reach the top.,2
154134,David's claim is incorrect because the short and wide box collects more heat and  the sun rays are moving in and out of the box faster.,3
154135,David's claim is incorrect ... because ... the skinny one is skinner and can not suck up as much energy as the wider one.,3
154141,David's claim is incorrect  because the wide one got more solar radiation.The tall one is tall so the solar radiation misses the box.,3
154143,David's claim is incorrect because the tall box did not recurved a lot of heat,2
154145,David's claim is that he thinks the skinny and tall box will heat faster because it's a smaller hole so less energy would come through.,2
154146,David's claim is incorrect because I did the graph also I proved it.,3
154147,David's claim is ... because is incorrect  because the tall and short doesnt heat up faster than the short and wide beacause the short and wide is more vonrable to the sun,3
154148,David's claim is incorrect because short and wide got hotter than tall and skinny in a shot amount of time.,3
154150,David's claim is ... because ... when you turn p the heat it goes faster because if it is tall and skinny since it is so small and skinny it would heat up.,2
154152,David's claim is partly corect because he said that the tall one is going to heat up faster but on the sides it will cover it and the small one will not cover it on the sides .,2
154153,David's claim is wrong because  the big box got hot by one minute.,3
154157,David's claim is incorrect because bigger box less heat stays because it doesn't jump up.,2
154159,David's claim is correct because,2
154160,David's claim is incorrect because the box is wide and short so since it's wide the solar radiation goes in easier.,3
154161,David's claim is incorrect because the wide and short box observes more sunlight and it gets the sunlight faster.,3
154162,David's claim is wrong... because the wide and short got hotter then the skinny and tall.,3
154193,David's claim is incorrect ... because ... in the end for the tall box the final temp was 3.1 celcuis and for the short one the finl temp was 58.4 celcuis,3
154194,David's claim is partly correct because when the skinny and tall box heats up it lets out less energy but takes a longer time to heat up due to its small opening. The short and wide will let out more energy but will heat up faster due to the wide opening. This is why David is partly correct.,4
154195,"David's claim is partly correct because he was right in saying that less energy would leave the box, but vice versa is true too. Less energy would enter the box. This causes the tall and skinny box to take more time to heat. The short and fat box on the other hand has a lot of entering space, so a lot of the sun's heat can come in.",4
154196,David's claim is ... because ...Davids claim is incorrect because the wide small box gets up to 60 degrees and the tall box gets only up to 40 degress.,3
154197,"David's claim is correct because there is less heat escaping. The picture showed that a lot of heat was not escaping trough the top, but the sides were where a lot of the heat was escaping. The movement of the heat was making the box hotter because the heat is absorbing more warmth from the sides, making it hotter.",2
154198,David's claim is incorrect because the short box would take less time for the gas to get out.,2
154199,David's claim is incorrect because,2
154200,David's claim is wrong  because the tall and skinny box didn't reach a high tempature like the short and wide so that i why ovens are no skinny and tall.,3
154201,David's claim is wrong because thee wide and short is shorter than the skinny and tall. So it gives the advantage for the wide and short to observe more heat.,3
154202,"David's claim is partly correct because with a skinny box, less sunlight leaves the box, but less comes in also.",3
154204,David's claim is ... because ... it is tall and sort,2
154205,David's claim is ... because ... the radiation is low because it is so deep.,2
154206,David's claim is incorrect because the wide and short box was hotter than the tall and skinny box within 4 minutes.,3
154208,David's claim is incorrect because the opening in the skinny and tall box does not let enough Solar Radiation in and it becomes Infared Radiation.,4
154210,David's claim is inorrect because by watching the model the wide and short box heats up faster than the tall and skinny box.,3
154211,David's claim is correct because there was a bigger window which let more heat in so it heated up faster and go hotter.,3
154212,David's claim is right ... because it took much longer for the wide and short box and it was much shorter amount of time with the tall and skinny .,2
154214,David's claim is incorrect because the skinny and tall model generated less heat in the same amount of time as the wide and short model.,3
154215,David's claim is ... because ...  the wide and short one has a wider window and the tall and skinny one has a smaller window.,3
154216,David's claim is in correct because when the yellow hits the ground it hits the oven and turns into air.,2
154218,David's claim is ... because sense the top of it is smaller and so more evaporation gets into it.,2
154220,David's claim is ... because ...the heat evaporates the skinny and tall box,2
154221,"David's claim is incorrect because the heat in the short box stays inside, but the tall boxes heat goes every were.",2
154224,The tall and skinny box is faster.,2
154225,David's claim is ... because ...he is corect,2
154226,David's claim is incorrect because he did not finish the graph.,2
154228,David's claim is correct because there is less air to evaporiate.,2
154307,David's claim is not correct... because ... the wide short is wider so the the heat will evorate.,2
154318,i think that David's claim is correct,2
154319,David's claim is wrong because the wide and short heats up faster because the window is larger radiating more heat.,2
154321,David's claim is correct because when since it is more skinny and the wide one it doesn't have as mush space for heat to come out of. So that is why Davids claim is correct.,2
154322,David's claim is ... because ...David's claim is incorrect because lots of heat leaves the oven and the tempature does not get very high.,2
154324,David's claim is incorrect  because the tall one has more space so the heat has more space to move around.,2
154325,David's claim is incorrect because the smaller and wider one is able to trap more heat because it is wider so the heat is getting trapped in there a bit longer.,3
154326,David's claim is ... because ... the box might be tall but it has a small opening  so it can not get a lot of heat,3
154327,David's claim is .wrong.. because  there were more tiny red heat dots in the wide box than the skinny box.,3
154329,David's claim is correct because it the ht is going in faster,2
154330,David's claim is correct... because they are the right temperatures.,2
154335,David's claim is ... because ... traps moar heat in the box to cook faster.,2
154337,David's claim is ... because ...with the wider gap I think that it doesn't matter because the width of the wide box has a smaller height and width than the smaller box I don't think that it would consume all the air so it would heat up faster.,2
154342,David's claim is partly correct because ... the tall and skinny starts kind of slow then increases and the small and wide model start fast then slows down,2
154343,David's claim is incorect  because the wide and short will heat up faster because ts closer to the sides,3
154345,David's claim is wrong because the solar oven is the more sun it's going to get more heat.,3
154353,David's claim is maybe. because it might not be as good,2
154371,David's claim is wrong because there is more heat in the wide and short becouse it lets more light .,4
154514,David's claim is wrong because ...the tall and skinny one is barely getting any energy from the sun because since the tall and skinny one is skinnyit cant get enery from sun since its skinny and the procces is slower,3
154703,David's claim is partly correct because not a lot of heat stayed in or IR and SR like he said will.,2
154155,"David's claim is partly right ... because ... while the tall one collects the heat , the wide one collect less heat  but holds it for loner time",2
154151,David's claim is ... because ... bv,1
153977,David's claim is wrong because if the box is short and wide that means it will open up to the sun faster and can fit more of the sun rays in then the long and skinny.,3
153978,David's claim is incorrect because the wider box has a bigger opening which attracted heat a lot faster and ended up with more heat. The tall and skinny box had a smaller opening which made it hard to attract heat.,3
153979,David's claim is correct because ...how he explain a sun ray was adequate and helpful also made alot of sense,2
153980,David's claim is incorrect because the other oven reached 52.9 after 4 minutes and the his reached 34.8 in 4 minutes.,3
153981,"David's claim is partly wrong because the sunlight had less of a chance of going into the opening of the box. When the sunlight did get inside and hit the edges of the box, it did become heat and stayed there. David was correct about that. Although sometimes that heat would escape and turn into infrared radiation. The horizontal box on the other hand had a wider opening and the sun rays had a better chance of heading in. Both the boxes had about the same amount of heat turn into radiation. The reason why the horizontal box has a higher temperature is because of the wide opening letting more sun come in.",5
153982,David's claim is not correct because the heat takes longer to get all the way into the tall and skinny box.,2
153983,David's claim is correct because when I did wide and short it took 7.18 minutes to finish but with tall and skinny it took 6.82 minutes to finish.,3
153984,David's claim is correct because the wide box has the most room to keep the heat in.,2
153985,"David's claim is incorrect because, IT IS JUST INCORRECT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",2
153987,David's claim is ... because ... it was correct because the triangle hit the bow and it went in like with some sort of energy and the heat went in and like sort of look like it ate it.,2
153988,David's claim is ... because ...incorrect the wide and short got up way faster than the skinny and tall went up then started going down fast we did this for 3 minutes the wide and short went way higher that the skinny and tall so far wide and short is about to be 60 degees,3
153989,David's claim is wrong because a wide and short box would get more heat at once and the skinny and tall box the heat would need to travel down to the bottom of the box.,3
153990,David's claim is not correct because probably the taller and shorter one could not hold the hotness in because it was to tall so most of the hotness could not reach the bottom.,2
153991,David's claim is wrong because the short and wide one heated up faster than the tall and skinny one did. The heat stayed at the bottom of the short box.,3
153992,David's claim is ... because ... He put a lot of aford and did a lot of resharch,2
153993,David's claim is wrong because if you have a wider box it gets more energy faster and if you have a tall box it is slower.,3
153994,"David's claim is partly correct because the tempatures from both boxes had pretty even tempature for each time. Therefor, David's claim is partly correct. I'ts in the middle.",2
153995,David's claim is incorrect because it is not likely for the solar radiation to go into the tall box because since the wide box is bigger and it can catch more unlike the tall box.,4
153996,David's claim is incorrect because if the skinny tall box doesn't observe air it won't get warm that's way you need a big box to be able to observe air.,2
153997,David's claim is not correct because if it shorter the sun will hit it faster than the other,2
153999,David's claim is incorrect because the sun rays create more heat when they have more room.,3
154000,David's claim is incorrect because all it really did was get to 40 C and didn't even get to that very fast,2
154026,"David's claim is incorrect, because since the opening in wider on the short and fat one, that means more heat can get let in .  The tall and skinny one has a short opening, so that means less heat can get in, it just rolls off.",2
154107,David's claim is incorrect  because the tall and skinny box is standing straight up so not that much sun goes into it. The short and fat box is laying flat so it will get more sun because it has a bigger opening while the tall and skinny one has a small opening to let the sun in.,4
154108,"David's claim is incorrect because when the wide and short box is used,there is more room in width and that lets more solar radiation get in that turns into heat. Also, since the wide and short box is so wide, all the solar radiation that goes to the ground goes to the box.",5
154109,"David's claim is incorrect... because ... he guessed the skinny and tall box would have more heat but after a minute with the sun heating the solar ovens up the wide and short had a degrees of 35.1( so after a minute it go hotter). For the skinny and tall box after a minute the degrees was 26.1(so the box let out hot air). So, as you can see the wide and short box can compact more heat.",3
154111,David's claim is incorrect because when I tested both boxes the skinny and tall box conducted less heat than the wide and short box in 2 minutes.,3
154113,David's claim is partly correct because ... if only a little bit of solar radiation comes in than it could mess with either so you wouldn't know the exact answer.,2
154114,David's claim is correct because the long and skinny one has more room for the sunrays could fit in.,2
154115,David's claim is incorrect ... because ... the heat grew faster in the wide and short one than the tall and skinny one.,3
154117,David's claim is wrong because when I got my results the wide and short box  stopped at 11 min. and the skinny and tall box stopped at 12 min.,2
154120,David's claim is wrong ... because ... i think the skinny and tall oven is not wide enough to catch any heat.,3
154121,David's claim is ... because ...The wide short box has way more energy.,2
154123,David's claim is wrong because the short one was wide so it would get more sunray then the tall because its skinny and the sunray miss it.,3
154125,David's claim is ..corect. because ...he used the right tecnec.,2
154126,David's claim is wrong be cause the short and wide go more temperature then the skinny and tall on because more of the sun light had a very small hole to go through then the wide and short one,3
154129,David's claim is wrong because the larger the box the more heat will fill in.While the skinny one doesn't have a big window as the wider one.,2
154131,David's claim is wrong because when I collected the data the wide and short box collected more heat.,3
154133,David's claim is .wrong because  his solar oven was short solar oven had more degrees.,2
154136,David is rong because the short and wide one get more heat.,3
154137,"David's claim is incorrect because the little video showed that the Skinny and Tall"" didn't have enough heat inside to actually heat up faster. The solar oven "" Wide and Short"" did have a lot of heat inside because it has a big surface area to trap a lot of heat to heat up faster.""",3
154138,David's claim is ... because ... the wide box had more space than the other box,2
154142,David's claim is that the skinny and tall box was going  to heat up faster because it needed less energy,2
154149,David's claim is wrong because it doesn't matter about the walls it maters on the flooring.,2
154154,davids claim is correct because if you look closely you can see that more of the arrows are turning red and then they are turning into little crums and they stay red like forever.,2
154156,David's claim is incorrect because the wide gives more space for the heat.,3
154302,David's claim is partly correct because the thing inside the box would be higher and closer to the sun than the one on the ground,2
154304,David's claim is incorrect and correct because he is right abought less air coming out of the box but that also means that less air is coming in.,3
154306,"David's claim is incorrect because even though the energy will leave, more energy is going into the box as the energy for the box.",2
154308,David's claim is correct because  the more the space is smaller the more concentrated heat coming at the object.,2
154309,"David's claim is partly correct because he was right about the skinny & tall box trapping more energy, but he was not right about the skinny & tall box heating up faster and hotter.",2
154312,David's claim is incorect  because it did not heat up as much as the other one did.,2
154313,David's claim is wrong because the wider top allows more heat to get in than more heat to get out,3
154314,David's claim is Incorrect because the wide and small box started with more head in 0.74 min. And then it kept on rising,3
154315,David's claim is correct... because ...he picked the tall skinny one and that one heats up the fastest.,2
154316,David's claim is wrong because because the smaller window let in less sun light and didn't get as hot.,3
154317,David's claim is wrong  because the wide short one make more heat and less radaition then the skinny tall one.,3
154320,"David's claim is wrong because, think of it like a pool, you know how the deep end is always smaller but is normally really cold on the bottom, unlike the shallow end which is always warm and never is as cold as the deep end. It is like this because when the pool (or box in this situation) the sun will heat up the surface of the water, and when it is more shallow, the bottom is closer to the surface, allowing the sun to seep in faster, though it is spread out more, it still heats up faster than the skinny and long box (or deep end) the bottom is a lot farther from the surface making it hard for the sun to seep all the way into the bottom or the warm water to be moved below.",3
154328,David's claim is ... because ...  the skinny and tall energy from the oven will let less energy come from the window.,2
154331,David's claim is not correct because the wide and short box will take more heat in and it won't let the heat out more than the tall and  skinny box.,3
154332,David's claim is ... because ...r,1
154333,David's claim is wrong because the wide and short one got twice the height of the tall and skinny one in the same amount of time.,3
154334,David's claim is wrong because the chart shows the skinny not getting any energy ....so..... that would mean that wide and skinny gets more energy.....EX: you are a trampalean but you were small... you wouldn't have a lot of kids jumping on you...they wouldn't use a lot of their energy.,2
,,1
154338,David's claim is ... because ...partly is so cunfising some time it's a good time.,2
154339,David's claim is correct because he said the short box will let less energy in.The tall box heated up slower than the short box because more energy went into the tall box and less energy went into the short.,2
154340,David's claim is wrong because the bigger box only get a little heat a minute but the wider one can get a lot of heat a minute.,3
154341,David's claim is wrong because the bigger box only get a little heat.,2
154344,David's claim is ... because ... his claim is wrong because the solar oven that is skinny and tall makes it harder to get the heat inside.,3
154346,David's claim is ... because ... the temperature go up very faster and real world this is impossible .,2
154704,"David's claim is incorrect because the skinny and tall box is not able to let as much sunlight into the box. The graph shows the skinny and tall box is under 40 degrees C, the whole time, unlike the wide and short box that was 59 degrees from 4 to 10 minutes. The short and wide box is able to have more heat go into the box diagonally and so can bounce around more and create more heat.",4
154846,David's claim is correct because the heat had a lot less room that it needed in order to spread around the whole box.,2
154847,David's claim is incorrect because the short and wide oven retained more heat in less time.,3
154848,David's claim is ... because ...,1
154914,David's claim is incorrect because the infrared radiation and the solar radiation take longer to leave the wide and short box.,2
154915,David's claim is ... because it has less space to move out of.,2
153978,"David's claim is incorrect because having an larger opening made the sun get to it easier and faster. When the box has a smaller opening, it's a small target. When the box has a big opening, it's a larger target.",3
153979,"David's claim is partly correct because ...because both boxes will hold the same amount of heat , because they   have the same  amount of  s space.",3
153982,David's claim is not correct because when you use a short and wide box it gets hotter than a tall and skinny box.,3
154914,"David's claim is incorrect because he said the tall and skinny box would let less heat out, but instead it let less light in and the short, wide box worked better.",4
153991,David's claim is party correct because the small/tall box lets less heat out it does not get a higher temperature.,3
154107,David's claim is wrong because the short and tall box will not get any sun in and the short and wide box will get more sun in cause in about 7.5 min it was at 60 degrees celsius. Also the short and wide box has a bigger opening than the tall and skinny box so the short and wide box has a really good chance to get a lot of sun.,4
154117,David's claim is wrong  because if you use a skinny and tall box  it will take longer which means it will use more energy and if you use a wide and short box then it won't take as long which  would use less energy.,2
154126,David's claim is that the skinny and tall one will let out less heat but the wide and short one let out less heat because the sunlight hits the heat back to were it was but the tall and skinny box could not let sunlight go in.,3
154111,David's claim is wrong because the wide and short box got hotter than the tall and skinny box.,3
154108,"David's claim is incorrect because when the wide and short box is used, more sunlight is able to get in.",3
154133,David's claim is wrong because the wide and short went up more degrees than the tall and skinny solar oven,3
154113,David's claim is not correct ... because ... the wide box went up 60` in 5 min and the tall box went up 38` in 5 min.,3
154120,David's claim is wrong because the short and wide box would collect more heat than the skinny and tall solar oven.,3
154137,David's claim is not correct because the wide one will have more room for heat and the skinny one has not that much room. The wide box will trap more heat and will heat up more faster. The skinny box will have less space and  will not heat up as that quick.,3
154154,David's claim is ... because ... tall and skinny can got more heat because the tall box is more space from the bottom to the top and the skinny is just skinny.,2
154114,David's claim is incorrect because in the tall box the heat has more space to fill up and on the small box it has less space to fill up.,2
154121,David's claim is ... because ...the heat stays in the box,2
154131,David's claim is incorrect because the wide and skinny box heated up to 50.8 deg celsius.,2
154125,David's claim is ... incorect because ...the other box got hater.,3
154123,David's claim is wrong  because its skinny so there less chance of sun rays hitting the box.,3
154313,David's claim is wrong because the small space wont get much heat in so no heat will come out because there is no heat.,3
154315,David's claim is wrong because in the tall wide box it has more area to fill and on the other hand the wide and short box has a bigger opening which the sunrays can fill faster,3
154304,David's claim is ... incorrect because ... the wide and short box lets a lot of heat inside the box and the skinny and tall boxes barely lets any heat in.,3
154704,"David's claim is wrong because the energy waves travel diagonally, hitting only the side of the skinny and tall box. The wide and short box is able to collect more heat rays because the box has a wider opening. The heat rays don't hit the side because the box is too short.",4
154303,David's claim is correct because the Temp for the wide and short box in the computer model was bigger than the skinny and tall box.,3
154309,"David's claim is partly correct because the while the skinny and tall box does keep in more heat, it doesn't trap as much heat because of it's small opening.",3
154316,David's claim is incorrect because the smaller whole didn't let in much light.,3
154312,David's claim is  wrong because yes it will let less heat escape but it wont let that much heat come in.,3
154302,David's claim is not correct because it wont heat up as well as the short and wide.,3
154314,David's claim is incorrect because the Wide and Short reached 52.9 Deg. C. In 2.97 minutes. The Skinny and Tall box reached 38.2 Deg. C. In the same time.,3
154317,David's claim is wrong because the short wide one created more heat because its shorter and flat so sun beams would bounce back and forth.,3
154320,"David's claim is incorrect because think of it like a swimming pool, the shallow end is always much larger and wider then the deep end, which is deep and skinny. The shallow end is always much warmer, but why?? that is because the sun has a bigger target to try to hit, and it is not too hard for the water that is warmer to circulate  to the bottom of the pool, whereas the bottom of the deep end pool is always really cold, and never really warm closer to the bottom, that is because the sun has a smaller target to try and hit, and it is hard for the water to circulate all the way to the bottom of the pool.",3
154344,David's claim is wrong because the computer model showed the wide and short box was a lot hotter than the tall and skinny box. The short and wide box has a bigger opening for more heat to come in faster.,4
153997,David's claim is wrong because wide and short got hotter because the height got to it faster.,3
153989,David's claim is partly correct because  the difference was 2 because the heat move around the same.,2
154000,David's claim is incorrect because the graph showed it,2
153987,David's claim is ... because ...the size of the box,2
153981,"David's claim is partly correct because the sun rays were missing the box more than the other wide and short box, but the heat did escape slower than the wide and short box because it takes longer for the heat to go up the sides of the box. Although some of the heat did escape eventually.",3
153980,David's claim is incorrect because the short and wide box heated up faster because there is a bigger window for the heat to come in and more room for the heat to get hotter.,3
153996,David's claim is not correct because the skinny and short box cant observe lots of heat like the wide and short box that has lots of space for air to be observed.,3
154026,"David's claim is partly correct ,because it is true that since the tall and skinny box has a smaller opening, less heat can get out.  However,  that means less heat can get in.  In the wide and short box, it has a larger opening, so that means that more heat can get in.",4
153985,"David's claim is incorrect, because the tall and skinny one let in less heat. For that reason it only got a total of 38.6 degrees Celsius. On the other hand the wide and short one let in way more heat. Therefore it got a total of 57.5 degrees Celsius",4
153999,David's claim is incorrect because the sort and long one has more room for sunrays to enter and heat up.,3
154138,David's claim is kind of correct because it heated up more than I thought.,2
154136,David's claim is not corcet because the sort wide got more heat,3
154115,"David's claim is ... wrong because ... the wide and short box got hotter, quicker.",3
154142,David's claim is correct because the wide and short box makes more heat.,3
154109,David's claim is incorrect because with the short and wide box it is easier to reach the bottom of the box to get hotter faster.,3
154346,David's claim is a study about sun because you can see the rays of sun,2
154308,David's claim is wrong because   the computer model shows that the flat one lets more heat in.,3
154306,"David's claim is incorrect because even though less heat escapes, less heats comes in too.",3
154331,David's claim is not correct because the short and wide box got a higher temperature then the tall and skinny box so he was not right.,3
154333,David's claim is wrong... because ... The tall and skinny one had a difference of 13.3 Celsius.,2
154341,David's claim is wrong  because the tall and skinny went higher temp then,2
154340,David's claim is wrong  because there is no room for the sun to get in.,3
154339,David's claim is wrong because it took about 15 minutes just so it could get to 40 degrees.,2
154846,David's claim is incorrect because the wide and short box would give the heat less time to escape because in the tall and skinny box the heat has to travel all the way down the box while the short and wide box the heat just falls into the box.,3
154149,David's claim is wrong because if it were a short and wide box then the sun light would reach the bottom and bounce to collect more heat but for the tall and skinny box the light wouldn't be able to reach the bottom there for not much light would bounce and make more heat.,4
154129,David's claim is wrong because it might be taller but it needs to be short because it has a bigger window so more heat can go inside.,3
154156,David's claim is wrong because wide and short has more energy because has more space for the energy gets in.,4
153995,David's claim is incorrect because since the solar oven was wider it could collect more rather than being tall. The tall and skinny box won't heat up as fast as the wide and short box because it doesn't have as much space.,3
154915,David's claim is ... because ... the solar oven that was tall and skinny was faster because it does not have a lot of with to warm up.,2
153983,David's claim is incorrect because the tall and skinny oven will also let heat come in longer because of the small window so it will let in less heat.,2
153994,"David's claim is incorrect because the bigger the box, the more sun gets let in. It also has room for more heat, so it will let in more sun quicker and get hotter sooner.",3
153988,David's claim is ... wrong because ... the heat speads out and it is cold short and wide the heat compresses to make it hotter,2
153993,David's claim is kind of correct because it is not fast but it heats up.,2
153990,David's claim is incorrect because the tall and short box let more air out and almost no air in it.,2
153992,David's claim is ... because ...it took longer than he predict,2
153977,David's claim is partly correct because the temperature rose to a high temperature at first and then it had a very fast downfall.,2
149950,"David's claim is ... because ...He has a bigger window in the skinny box which makes heat escape.However the small box has a small opening , so that makes less heat get out.",3
149966,David's claim is wrong because the energy inside of the wide and short box made it heat of faster (45.8 degrees Celsius in 2 minutes) than the skinny and tall box (34.5 degrees Celsius in 2 minutes).,3
149972,"David's claim is partly correct because the tall and skinny solar oven didn't let as much heat out, but didn't let as much in either.  The short and wide solar oven let more heat escape, but captured more heat too.",3
149587,"David's claim is wrong because the wide one is wide, there is more space for solar and infrared radiation to come in. Although heat rises and it would be easier to escape, it is much easier for it to come in so it would be faster with the wide and short box. The tall and skinny one is hard to collect hear from the sun because there is not as much space",3
149959,David's claim is correct because on the chart the tall and skinny one is heating up faster,2
149953,David's claim is ... because ...  the heat in tall and skinny left over time and it started to get colder and the wide and short kept the heat and kept adding more and more heat.,3
149970,David's claim is wrong because the energy gets trapped inside the wide box because the ground also heats it up.,3
149963,David's claim is wrong  because sunrays in the wide and short oven stay in there longer than the tall and skinny oven.,3
149590,David's claim is correct ... because ... the skinney and tall box was heated up faster.,2
149956,David's claim is ... because ... the heat would just come out so it would take longer to heat up.,2
149964,David's claim is not correct because the short but wide box got more heat in the less amount of minutes than the other box.,3
149961,David's claim is ... because ... the time is faster,2
149588,"David's claim is incorrect but partly right, he is incorrect because the smaller one has more room and he's partly right because he just got the two boxes mixed up.",2
150650,David's claim is incorrect  because the short box has more room than the tall box.,2
149968,David's claim is incorrect because the wide and short is 45c in 2.5 min.,2
149955,David's claim is right  because so much heat was inside the oven .,2
149967,David's claim is ... because ...he only recorded the wide and tall,2
149589,"David's claim is incorrect because in 45 seconds the wide box reached a temperature of about 25 degrees celsius, while the tall box reached a temperature of 25 degrees celsius in 55 seconds.",3
150648,David's claim is incorrect because the one thats is wide and short lets more heat in.,3
149960,David's claim is ... because ...heat rises and the box that is higher so it will get hotter faster,2
149965,David's claim is ... because ... the skinny and tall one won't collect that much energy because it's too skinny.,3
149954,David's claim is ... because ...its smaller so every thing would be inside and the SR would go and take all the space and make it but it does not work like the wider box.,2
149962,David's claim is ... because ... it gets hotter way faster than the  other one,2
149947,"David's claim is wrong  because the wide and short box can collect more of the sun's rays, so tempeture increaces more.",4
149958,David's claim is incorrect because despite the fact the tall and skinny's hole is smaller so less heat escapes less heat enters either.,4
149969,David's claim is wrong because the short and long box heated up alot faster.,3
149951,David's claim is partly right... because... in the little video it shows that the tall and long one gets less sun rays,2
149971,David's claim was wrong because the tall and skinny box oven couldn't hold in as much heat.,3
149586,David's claim is good because its true,2
150065,"David's claim is partly right because  this oven does have longer sides, but it has a small opening.",3
150066,David's claim is incorrect because the model shows that the wide and short one collects more data because it has a wider opening. The skinny and tall one has a skinny opening so it will take more time collecting data.,3
150074,David's claim is ... because ... The wide and skinny box heated up way faster than David anticipated.,2
150076,David's claim is not correct because the wide and short one is trapping more heat than letting it escape.,3
150073,David's claim is incorrect  because  more sun rays go in the small but wide according to the model,3
150078,David's claim is wrong because the skinny and tall oven takes longer to heat up because the solar radiation does not stay in there too long.,3
150070,David's claim is incorrect because the long and skinny box does not turn solar radiation into heat as fast as the wide and short box does and the wide and short box cools down slower than the long and skinny one.,4
150072,"David's claim is incorrect because although the skinny and tall can old maybe more supplies that are tall, it can't hold many cells because it is small and nimble unlike the wide box.",2
150075,"David's claim is ... incorrect because ...the heat built up slower in the tall and thin box, but the heat built up faster in the short and wide box.",3
150077,"David's claim is wrong because he thought that a smaller space would heat up faster, but no. The skinny one took longer to heat up than the wide one. The movement of energy was faster for the wide solar oven because there were more red dots inside, or heat based.",3
150069,David's claim is wrong because the bar graph explains that the wide and short window line goes up constantly and the skinny and tall one goes up slowly,3
151162,David's claim is right because the tall skinny one goes faster than the wide one,3
150052,David's claim is wrong because the small but wide one is correct because it takes a bit longer but the tall and skinny one takes a while because its deep.,3
150067,David's claim is not... because ...the ovens are tinier so the heat stays in and the oven gets hotter,2
150063,David's claim is incorrect because because the short and wide box collected more heat than the tall and skinny.  At two minutes the short and wide box was at a higher temperature than the tall and skinny.,3
150056,David's claim is partly  correct because the boxes heat up about the same time because the wide and sort box and the long and skinny bow are the same its just one has a bigger window and the other has a smaller window.,4
150061,David's claim is incorect because the wide short box heated up faster than the skinny tall box.,3
150059,David's claim is partly correct because it is heating up really  fast but it also is not heating so fast so that is the reason why it is partly correct.,2
150062,David's claim is partly because they both heated up at the same speed but the long and skinny one did heat up a little bit faster.,2
150064,David's claim is partly because In the videos both lose thing but the tall one lost more them the wide one.,2
150079,David's claim is ... because ...incorrect because he proupla wasn't paying atitieon.,2
150053,David's claim is not correct because he said that the tall and skinny one would heat up faster because there is a smaller window so it will let out less energy.But the short and wide one is the one that heated up faster and if you dont believe me look at the graph  ...,3
150054,David's claim is not correct because it took about a minute longer for the skinny and tall box to heat up to 30 degrees than the wide and short box.,3
150055,David's claim is ... because ... it is not going that fast and sometimes it will be slow .,2
150058,David's claim is ...not because ...the till one is not handing more eneger,2
150060,David's claim is correct because the temperature rose faster with the skinny box.,2
150071,David's claim is correct because it takes only 30 seconds for the temperature to rise.,2
150057,David's claim is not correct because more heat gets trapped in the wide box at a time.,3
150085,David's claim is partly correct because the wide and short setup is getting more heat inside than the skinny and tall setup. But on the other hand the wide and short setup is also letting out more heat than the skinny and tall box.,3
150098,David's claim is incorrect because David had said that the tall and skinny oven would heat up faster but really the correct answer would have been that the wide and short oven will heat up faster. This is because the movement of the energy for the wide and short oven is moving faster than the tall and skinny oven.,3
150087,David's claim is incorrect because the wide and short oven got more red dots than the skinny and tall one did.,3
150104,David's claim is wrong because the skinny tall box did not catch much heat or light there fore it took longer to cook what ever was in it,4
150101,David's claim is wrong because the wide and short box got hotter than the tall and skinny box. The wide and shot box got to about 32 deg. celsius in a minute and the tall and skinny box got to about 32 deg. celsius in two or three minutes.,3
150099,David's claim is wrong because the wide and short one covers more ground. Instead of having more heat hit around more heat hits the oven model. The tall and skinny one covers a small amount of ground so a lot of the heat goes around. The tall and skinny one is tall and keeps more heat in but not a lot of heat gets in.,4
150105,David's claim is incorrect because the wide and short oven will heat faster.,3
150109,David's claim is wrong because in the digital solar oven the small and wide bax heats more because of the sunrays.The sun rays go into the box and stay there and heat up quickly than the tall and wide box.,3
150093,David's claim is partly because they both go up and both start lower?down and when i switch the order of the bows they both go up or down.,2
150086,David's claim is ... because ...wide and short is better,2
150097,David's claim is ... correct and incorrect  because ... he said it will let less energy in the oven,2
150083,David's claim is incorrect because i saw that the short and wide box get more heat than the skinny and taller box.,3
150114,David's claim is ronge  because he put the yellow in the red,2
150094,David's claim is wrong because the tall sun oven does not have alot of area space,2
150084,David's claim is incorrect because the heat can still go through the window or the walls.,2
150082,David's claim is correct  because the top of the skinny figure will trap all the air whereas the other figure can cool down faster because all the steam can be easily let out.,2
150103,"David's claim is incorrect because ... the skinny and tall oven did heat up pretty fast, but not as fast as the wide and short oven. I didn't see a significant difference between the movement of energy in the two ovens.",3
150090,David's claim is incorrect because the short stocky one heats up faster and gets hotter the window has nothing to do with it heating up,2
150092,David's claim is ... because ... the tall one has a biger capicity becuase of that if will be harder to worm up. the small one will have know trouple worming up it has a smaller cpacity,2
150113,David's claim is ... because ...755868,1
150080,David's claim is rawne because if you put it on mege speed the wide and small gos a lot faster then  the tall and skeny one.,3
150111,David's claim is ... because ...it has the wrong gragh notes,2
150112,David's claim is Wrong because The oven got hot and then cooled down.,2
150096,David's claim is that the sinny box will have more heat because there was less room but the wider box had more heat in it.,2
150081,David's claim is ... because ... no heat can get in.,2
150132,"David's claim is correct because the short and wide oven went to 30(C) in 1.5 minutes while the skinny and tall oven took 2 minutes to get to 30(C). Therefore, it heats up faster.",3
150133,David's claim is incorrect because the wide and short oven energy heats up faster.,3
150130,David's claim is incorrect because the wide and short box can get more energy in a smaller amount of time and it has more space for the energy to move around in the bottom.,3
150127,David's claim is incorrect because the wider box filled up quicker.,3
150117,"David's claim is correct because the deeper the box is, the more hot it gets. The shorter the box is, the heat is going to escape.",2
150115,David's claim is ... because ... I don't know.,1
150124,David's claim is .partly correct.. because ...the box did get hotter but it stopped heating up at 2 minutes.,2
150131,"David's claim is incorrect because the tall and skinny box didn't have a big enough opening to let more heat in and stay. Therefore,  the wide and short box will contain the most heat.",4
150134,David's claim is partly correct because less sun goes in but less comes out in the tall and skinny one.,3
150145,David's claim is ... because ...that the skinny and wide is the best one because it  can hold that energy,2
150137,David's claim is .. correct  because ... the heat really did stay inside of the box due to its small opening.,2
150139,David's claim is incorrect  because the wide and short one heats up faster,3
150149,David's claim is correct because the tall skinny box heated up quickly and stayed level after it got warm where as the wide and skinny box warmed up quick too but then dropped very coldly.,2
150140,David's claim is wrong because the wide and short solar oven heated up more than the skinny and tall solar oven.,3
150122,David's claim is incorrect because the wide and short heated up the fastest within a 2 min period. This happened because all the sides are bigger than all the sides on the skinny and tall box. And since the wide and short box is shorter it can get more sunlight than the tall and skinny box can in the evening and the morning.,3
150123,David's claim is partly correct because the small and tall box keeps the heat,2
150138,David's claim is ... because ... it is wider.,2
150118,David's claim is incorrect because the wide and short box is bigger than the tall and skinny box,2
150136,"David's claim is ... because ... although the taller solar oven may be bigger, it cannot take in as much heat as the broad solar oven can, which leads me to believe that the wider solar oven heats up faster than the other.",2
150142,"David's claim is incorrect because he said the tall and thin opening box will heat up faster than the other box""""",2
150125,David's claim is incorrect because I saw much more heat in the wide and short box than the tall and skinny one. This means that the box I think is correct is right because heat got there faster and there was more.,3
150116,David's claim is incorrect because the solar power from the sun barely gets in the box.,3
150126,David's claim is wrong because the short and wide box was hotter,2
150148,David's claim is     partly correct becuase idk,1
150135,David's claim is incorret because he said that the large box will get more engery but the small box got more engery than the large box did.,3
150128,"David's claim is in correct because the short and fat box heated to 44 degrees celsius in 2 minutes, while the tall and thin box  only heated to 32 degrees celsius in 2 minutes. this happened because the opening of the short and fat box is bigger, allowing more sunlight to come in.",4
150144,David's claim is not correct ... because the wider and shorter one collected more sun rays,3
150516,David's claim is right because the Tall and skinny one had more heat in it and the short and wide one had a lot less heat .,2
150120,David's claim is wrong because the wide and short solar ovens gets more solar radiation and heat and infrared radiation,3
150129,David's claim is partly wrong  because the wide and short box got very hot very fast and the short and tall got hot but it took some time to get to a good level of heat.,2
150121,David's claim is ... because ... he thought that if the box was skinny it would gain more but he forgot 1 fact that heat goes up so by the time the new heat got to the old heat up it would lose heat and become cold.,2
150143,David's claim is True... because thing will heat up faster if there is less room in the box/solar power oven,2
150146,David's claim is wrong because the short and wide box seems more progressive when the long and thin box is slow and takes up more time.,3
150141,David's claim is incorrect because the wide and short one gets more heat then the other one,3
150195,David's claim is incorrect because if the window is smaller then less energy will initially get in to keep it in. The reason he is incorrect is because when you test the tall and skinny one it does not collect much heat but does not let much out. For the wide and short it shows that it collects a lot of energy and let a a little bit more than the skinny and tall.,4
150200,David's claim is ... because ...The low and wide box fills up faster,2
150198,David's claim is partly because its not really that much about window size.,2
150158,David's claim is ... because ...He is incorrect because he the skinny one went like 2 min faster,2
150159,David's claim is wrong because the short and wide box heated up faster.,3
150153,David's claim is ... because ... the tall and short oven did let out less heat but not a lot of heat entered,2
150162,"David's claim is ... because ... He said that he thinks the tall skinny oven will heat up faster but he was wrong! The tall skinny one didnt heat up faster, the short fat one did.",3
150173,David's claim is not correct because not much sunlight is going inside.,3
150164,David's claim is wrong because if the heat stays at the bottom the wider bottom would be better.,2
150178,David's claim is not correct because i choose the skinny and tall box and the temperature is going up slowly.,2
150176,David's claim is ... incorrect because ... the short and wide oven heated up faster than the long and skinny oven.,3
150166,David's claim is wrong ... because ...the skinny and tall box wont let many heat get out but the wide and short box will let heat come in faster since it has a bigger opening on the top of the box.,3
150160,David's claim is ... because ...I didn't get the graph,2
150155,David's claim is wrong because the graph shows the short and wide one at  45 degrees celsius in 2 minutes but the skinny and tall one at 33 degrees celsius at 2 munites,3
150172,David's claim is wrong because the wide and short one gets hotter faster because it has more room for heat to come in,3
150175,correct because when the energy came in it didnt come out as much.,2
150161,David's claim is ... because ... his heated up more faster than mine and mine was too slow and david was correct.,2
150177,David's claim is right because ... light will reach the box better and not let heat out,2
150163,David's claim is right because ...the tall one heats up faster,2
150157,David's claim is ... partly corect because ...it gets higher faster,2
150174,David's claim is wrong because the big but short oven leaves less energy.,2
150154,David's claim is incorrect because the tall and skinny one will heat up much slower. I say that it will because it is too tall and it takes more time to fill up.,3
150167,David's claim is halfway correct because the two boxes are the same in heat at any point.,2
150194,David's claim is wrong because  the wide box at 43 seconds had already passed the thin box,3
150168,David's claim is wrong... because ... the wide and short oven has a larger bottom that create convection currents.,2
150171,David's claim is right  because it's loosing less energy.,2
150199,David's claim is correct... because ...the skinny but tall box did not take as how much time as the wide but small box because there is less space in the tall but skinny box then there is in the wide but small box,2
150196,David's claim is ... because ...wwww,1
150201,David's claim is correct because the skinny one lets the heat out faster,2
150156,David's claim is ... because ... snoopdog noscped him,1
150243,David's claim is wrong because ... the wide and short one is wider and can take in heat faster because it has a much larger space.,3
150204,David's claim is incorrect because in one minute of time the short and wide solar oven reached 32.1 degrees celsius while the skinny and tall solar oven reached 28.2 degrees celsius.,3
150244,David's claim is ... because ... they get more heat.,2
150219,"David's claim is incorrect because since the box is short and wider, so it will catch more sunlight. The movement of the sun's energy will heat up the wider oven.",4
150231,David's claim is no because the wide and short gets heat faster.,3
150236,David's claim is wrong because the wider box got more solar because it is wider.,3
150246,David's claim is wrong because when the box is thin so it dosen't get alost of warmth inside.,2
150240,David's claim is incorrect because the model shows that the skinny and tall box captures less sun rays and captures less heat.,3
150242,David's claim is incorrect because the skinny and tall oven rejected most of the heat. While the wide and short oven had more bounce into it.,3
150218,David's claim is wrong... because ...the wider box heated up faster,3
150226,David's claim is wrong because in my results the fatter one is going up quiker,3
150208,David's claim is ... not correct because ... on the graph the temperature for the wide and short box is higher than the skinny and tall box's temperature.,3
150235,David's claim is .incorrect.. because .the short and wide box heated up faster than the tall and thin one did.,3
150220,David's claim is incorrect because the heat seems to want to go to the object with a bigger opening.,3
150228,David's claim is wrong because the wide short one all the goes in there and the skinny and tall one barely heat goes in it . the wide short one gets more heat,3
150223,David's claim is ... because ...the wider box has more space for the sun to come in and the other box doesn't.The graph shows the wider box getting hotter then when I switched the boxes it dropped and started going again but this time the graph looks different it is going quite slow and the heat was lower.This is why David's claim was wrong.,3
150205,David's claim is ... because ... incorrect because he max is going very fast and that is not good.,2
150230,David's claim is ... because ...the wide and short one heated up faster because the solar praticles stayed in longer.,3
150249,David's claim is correct because since the skinny and tall box has a small hole the only problem is it takes longer to fill,2
150245,David's claim is incorrect because there is more heat that gets trapped in the wide and short solar oven than the skinny and tall solar oven.,3
150203,I think that he is wrong because the heat rises more when more heat is aloud in.,2
150248,David's claim is correct because he it is really happening in the model.,2
150222,David's claim is incorrect because he said that the taller one will heat up faster and I saw that the wide and short .,3
150237,David's claim is wrong because even tho more energy go out not as much comes in make the wide and short heat up way faster that the tall and skiny one,3
150241,David's claim is ... because ... he  thought the tall box let more heat in but instead it let more out .,2
150221,David's claim is incorrect because the answer is wide and short.,3
150206,"David's claim is I think the skinny and tall oven will heat up faster than the wide and short oven because the window is smaller, so it will let less energy leave the oven. because when it taller it might colect more faster but the short one was faster becase its smaller""",2
150247,David's claim is partly right because not much can get out but not much can get out,2
150215,David's claim is ... because ... more gos in,2
150239,David's claim is ... because ... more heat would get into the wide and short oven and the same amount of infrared radiation and sun radiation get into both boxes.,2
150207,David's claim is incorrect because the graph was going steeper on the wide and short than the skinny and tall.,3
150238,David's claim is incorrect because the wide and short gets more heat but the tall and skinny one gets a lot of solar radiation.,2
150214,David's claim is ... because ...is partly correct because the taller one takes longer,2
150089,David's claim is  correct because the oven door is so small it wont let out the heat molecules as fast.,2
150119,David's claim is wrong because the wide and short solar oven filled up faster than the skinny and tall solar oven. I the wide and short solar oven filled up faster because it has more space so it collects more energy.,2
150197,David's claim is incorrect because the tall and skinny box has less room so less heat to hold.,2
150202,David's claim is that the skinny and tall oven is faster because it is tall and the heat absorbed quicker.,2
150165,David's claim is right because if the box is wider it will have to spread everywhere. For the tall and skiny if the air goes in the box it goes straight down so it will jtake a shorter amount of time.,2
149590,David's claim is ... because ...the skinny and tall box heated up faster,2
150648,David's claim is incorrect because the short5 and wide box lets in more heat and if it doesnt let in much heat then it does not have much heat to hold in even if it does hold in heat.,3
149953,David's claim is wrong because wide and short gathered more and more heat than tall and skinny.,3
150071,David's claim is correct because the red line on the graph moves faster when it is on skinny and tall.,2
151162,David's claim is right because ... theres a lot of heat in the box.,2
150067,David's claim is ... because ... The tall and skinny one has a smaller window and does not get a lot of heat while the other has a big window so it keeps more heat,3
150134,David's claim is partly correct because less heat goes out but less heat comes in.,3
150123,"David's claim is partly correct because the wide and short one gets more heat, but the tall one keeps it in longer.",3
150128,David's claim is incorrect because the skinny and tall solar oven heated up 12 degrees celcius less than the wide and short box.,3
150136,David's claim is WRONG because the computer model shows that the wider and shorter solar oven heats up faster than the taller and slimmer oven displayed above.,3
150122,David's claim is false because i ran each for 2 minutes and the temperature was higher for the wide and short box. The wide and short box was hotter because it is wide so it can gather more rays than it can if it is skinny or tall.,4
150135,"David's claim is incorrect because he said that the tall and skinny box will heat up faster that the small box. If he used the small box, the small box the small box will heat up faster that the tall box.",3
150231,David's claim is correct because there is less to travel so it will get more heat.,2
150247,David's claim is skinny and tall because ...,2
150215,Davids clame was rong becuse sinse the box was so skinny no heat or sunrays cant get in.,3
149959,David's claim is ...wrong because the time is at 10 minuets  and the tall and skinny one is at 45 degrees celcius and the short and the short and wide one is at 55 degrees celciuse.,3
149970,David's claim is wrong because his guess was wrong.,2
149967,David's claim is ...incorrect because ...It was a small window,3
149957,David's claim is  partly true... because ...the energy did escape a lot but also didn't escape because of the window,2
149961,David's claim is ... because ...it keeps more heat in place.,2
149954,David's claim is ... because ... it's in correct because he thought the skinny he thought since it has less space it would take less time for it to heat.,2
150073,David's claim is incorrect because  the opening is bigger in the wide and short box so more sun rays go in.,4
150078,David's claim is wrong because the small and wide box heats up faster,3
150077,"David's claim is incorrect because the window is too small and the box is hollow and skinny, so the sun won't go through the oven all the way. The movement of energy in the skinny and tall box is not a lot. The heat is mostly on the ground, on the sides, and mostly in the back of the oven.",3
150062,David's claim is partly because yes the skinny and tall let less energy leave the oven but also the wide and short.,2
150076,"David's claim is incorrect because based on the information I collected form the computer model, the short and wide increased its temperature. The movement of energy causes one solar oven to heat up faster than the other because the wide opening gap lets the infrared radiation, in the inside, becomes heat.",5
150130,David's claim is incorrect because The wide and short box got more heat faster and kept it in longer than the skinny and tall box.,3
150115,David's claim is wrong because at 5 minutes for the wide and short it was 59.4 C and for the skinny and tall it was 36.5 C.,3
150149,David's claim is incorrect ... because The short and wide box heated up way quicker and he thought the tall and skinny box would heat up quicker.,3
150125,David's claim is wrong because the short and wide box gives more space for the heat to come in.,3
150124,David's claim is incorrect because because the wide and short box absorbed heat faster than the tall and skinny box and trapped the heat.,3
150177,"David's claim is incorrect because the short and wide box is going to let the heat in and if that doesn't work, the plastic wrap will keep it inside the box at all times in the process.",3
150178,David's claim is not correct because i choose the wide and short box and it was much faster than the tall and skinny because the tall and skinny is too tall.,3
150198,I think that David's claim is incorrect because looking it the graph his answer does not compute.See in the graph I see that the wide and short box takes in more sunlight faster.,4
150175,David's claim is wrong even tho it seem like it would be right it is actually wrong.,2
150161,David's claim is ...incorrect  because ...wide and short has more space and side it because it is wide and the skinny and tall only is skinny and not much of the light can hit it.,3
150196,David's claim is wonrg  because short and wide got hotter faster,3
150202,David's claim is wrong because in the diagram it shows that the short and wide take less time to heat up.,3
150172,David's claim is wrong because  the skinny and tall box took longer to heat up than the short and wide box,3
150226,David's claim is incorrect  because the wide and short box heated up faster than the skinny and tall.The short and wide one heated up faster because it doesn't have to trap as much as the tall and skinny one did.,3
150204,David's claim is incorrect because The wide and short oven's line went at a much stepper incline then the skinny and tall.,3
150223,"David's claim is wrong because, the short and wide box got more heat than the tall and skinny box.",3
150145,David's claim is rong because he was only caring about the energy not the heat and it still was rong,2
149968,David's claim is incorrect because the sort and wide one in 20.0 in the start and 58.4 for 5 min. The skinny and tall is 20.0 at the start and 39.0 in the end.,3
149966,"David's claim is wrong because the solar heated up i a smaller amount of time if it was the short a d wise box, and longer if it was the tall and skinny box.",3
149963,David's claim is not correct because the wide and short box was hotter than the tall and skinny box. They both had two minutes each.,3
149586,David's claim not because wide and short has more heat.,2
149958,David's claim is wrong because the wide and short oven heated up much faster because there is a bigger opening on the wide and short box than on the skinny and tall box.                  I think he thought the skinnier one would be better because there would be less heat escaping but with the right internal design for the wide and short box it will be taking in more heat but won't be losing to much.,4
149589,David's claim is incorrect because the tall box is letting almost no heat in.,3
149951,David's claim is wrong  because more sunrays got into the wide and short one,3
149588,"David's claim is wrong because he had thought a different way, but heat won't go into a skinny box if it is skinny.",2
149956,David's claim is .incorrect .. because the heat would go up then just go down making the celsietes harder to even hotter.,2
149587,"David's claim is partly correct because although less heat can escape the box, less heat can enter the box and the wide box can trap a lot more heat.",3
149962,David's claim is incorrect  because  at five minutes the skinny and tall one was at 36.9 degrees and the wide and short one was at 55.2 degrees at five minutes. This is why Davids claim is incorrect.,3
149972,David's claim is incorrect because the short and wide box got hotter than the tall and skinny box.,3
149960,David's claim is not right because the heat got out when it got to about 40c .,2
150217,"David's claim is ... because ...
David`s claim is incorrect,  because in thes model, the wide and short box was able to trap in way more heat than the tall and skinny box because there is more room.",3
150065,"David's claim is wrong because even though if the tall and skinny box has a smaller opening for heat to get out, it is harder for it to get in.",3
150079,David's claim is ... because ... When its tall and skinny it can't catch or hold as much sunrays as the short and wide one can hold a lot.,3
150061,David's claim is incorrect because he said the skinny tall would heat up faster than wide short but it is the other way around.,3
150060,David's claim is wrong because the tall and skinny box does not have enough room for the sun rays to enter.,3
150053,David's claim is incorrect because when you put the two up against each other the short and wide one heated up a lot faster and got a lot hotter than the skinny and tall one by 1 minute and 75 seconds and by 2 degrees.,3
150063,"David's claim is incorrect because the opening of the tall and skinny box was too small, meaning not as much heat went into the box.",3
150052,David's claim is wrong because ...the wide and skinny one ended up being really hot.,3
150074,David's claim is ... because ... the skinny and tall box rose way less than the wide and short in a little amount of time.,3
150055,David's claim is ... because ... it is not how it will look like and it will not be the same .,2
150064,David's claim is wrong because the skinny and tall box loses the heat and sunrays.,2
150057,David's claim is ... because ... the short and wide lets more heat in and at the same time doesn't as much heat out because it's thicker. The tall and skinny is not thick and allows less heat in.,3
150056,David's claim is incorrect because the short and wide oven heated up more and faster than the tall and skinny solar oven. I know this because in tested both of them and i saw the graph results and it shows that the short and wide solar oven heated up faster.,3
150070,David's claim is incorrect because when the solar radiation hit the tall and skinny box it came in it left the box faster than when it left the wide and short one.When solar radiation hit the wide and skinny box it was maintained there longer than than the tall and skinny box.,4
150075,"David's claim is wrong because according to the computer model, the short and wide box heats up faster than the tall and skinny box.",3
150054,David's claim is not because I the skinny and tall box took longer for it to rise to 30 degrees than the wide and short box.,3
150058,David's claim is ... because ...the widn and small bok has mrom hot,2
150111,David's claim is ... because ...partly because he did short and wide,2
150108,David's claim is ... because ...the hit was in the box.,2
150082,David's claim is wrong because it doesn't let the sunrays get in as easily as wide and short.,3
150083,"David's claim is is incorrect ,because what i saw that was the tall and skinny oven got less heat and the wide and short oven got more heat.",3
150127,David's claim is incorrect because the short and wide box heated up much faster. I think the short and wide box heated up quicker because when convection currents spin the heat goes outward before going up.,3
150117,David's claim is incorrect because it seems that the short and wide box  has more heat than the tall and narrow box. The short and wide box got to 50 degrees celsius in about 4 to 5 minutes while the tall and narrow box got up to 38 degrees celsius in 4 to 5 minutes.,4
150516,David's claim is wrong because the wide and short one collects more heat then the skinny and tall one. The skinny and tall one collects no heat. So David is incorrect.,3
150137,David's claim is not correct  because  the short and wide solar oven allowed more radiation and heat to come in. But the skinny and tall did not allow as much radiation or heat in so that is the reason why it got a lower temperature.,4
150133,David's claim is wrong because when the sunrays reflect off the box the sunrays hit the ground and they bounce off the ground and they are not hitting the box.,2
150118,David's claim is incorrect because if the tall and skinny box has a smaller window that means less radiation can get in.,3
150121,David's claim is wrong because he tested and the heat would get cold by the time he got back the heat.,2
150116,David's claim is wrong because according to the computer model wide and shot gets more heat in.,3
150141,David's claim is incorrect because in the computer model the wibe and shot box trapt more heat,3
150120,David's claim is wrong because he thought the tall and skinny solar oven will heat up faster which it did not,3
150132,"David's claim is incorrect because the wide and short oven heats up faster than the skinny and tall one. I think this happens because more heat could get into the wide and short one, while the skinny and tall one has heat bouncing off of it.",4
150167,David's claim is wrong because the chart shows the wide and short box is hotter.,3
150168,"David's claim is wrong because the tall and skinny has less room for solar radiation to move, while the wide and short box has more room for solar radiation to move around.",3
150170,David's claim is incorrect because the wide and short gathers more heat because the top is really wide. For the skinny in tall the opening is skinny.Over time it's not gonna get a lot of heat because of this.,4
150158,David's claim is ... because ...Becuse the wide went faster and hotter,3
150173,David's claim is not correct  because the short and wide one got hotter.,3
150162,David's claim is ...corect because ... he said the tall & skinny oven would heat up faster then the short & fat oven and the tall & skinny some DID heat up faster.,2
150155,David's claim is wrong because the wide and short box got to 54.6 degrees celcuis but the skinny and tall one got to 47.3 degrees celcuis.,3
150174,David's claim is ... because ... Davids claim is incorrect because the wide and short oven got more heat.,3
150156,David's claim is ... because ...because he forgot to put tin foil,2
150199,David's claim is partly correct because the box did heat up more then the wide but short but the tall but skinny box cept down down such as the wide but short box did not.,3
150176,David's claim is ...incorrect because ...the short oven heated up faster than the tall oven did.,3
150235,David's claim is incorrect because the short and wide box heated up faster and David thought the tall and thin box would.,3
150241,David's claim is wrong  because ... in the way a tall box will heat up and then eventually simmer down. But with a short and wide box there is a more wide stance to get more heat and will heat up faster .,4
150207,David's claim is incorrect because the wide and short box heats up faster. It does this because it lets more sun go into the box since its wider.,4
150206,David's claim is wrong because the tall one was not as well as the short and wide one. I think he is also wrong because the tall one has taller side witch is harder for the sun to travel from sideways to down.,3
150221,David's claim is incorrect because the wide and short box heated up more in 5 minutes.,3
150208,David's claim is incorrect because the short and wide box heated up faster than the tall and skinny box. At 6.15 minutes the short and wide box was at 62.4 deg celcius and the tall and skinny box was at 38.4 deg celcius.,3
150246,"David's claim is partly correct because some time it was really high up but after that it would completly drop, while the wide and short would slowly go up and down.",3
150244,David's claim is partly right because it does keep the heat in but the other box gets more heat.,2
150249,David's claim is wrong because since the tall one has a smaller window doesnt mean it heat up.,3
150205,David's claim is ... because ...the heat come towards to the solar ovens and the heat is going inside the solar oven.,2
155700,"David's claim is partly correct because the tall and skinny box doesn't get as much heat as the wide and short box,but it doesn't let the heat out.",3
150228,David's claim is wrong  because both of them could be the same,2
150218,David's claim is incorrect because on the chart it showed the wide one heated up faster.,3
150242,David's claim is incorrect because the temp moved up very little compared to the other box type.,3
150203,Davids answer is wrong because it is not able to catch as much heat like the other on did.,3
150240,"David's claim is incorrect because the wide and short box trapped more heat. The wide and short box trapped more heat because the opening was wider, so more sun rays could pass through, heating up the box. The skinny and tall box trapped less heat because the opening was narrow, so less sun rays passes through. Also, the box was taller, so the heat didn't really get trapped, because the rays bounced off.",5
150248,David's claim is wrong because he guessed it wrong.,2
150237,David's claim is .wrong.. because yes less heat comes out but also none will come in,2
150219,David's claim is incorrect because the wide and short box will heat up faster. it will heat up quicker because it is wider. The movement of energy causes more light to go into the wider box because it collects more because of its width.,4
150220,David's claim is incorrect because there is a bigger opening for the wide solar oven than the skinny solar oven's heat escapes quickly.,3
150243,David's claim is wrong because the wide and short one can get more heat because it is wider and smaller so more of the Sun's radiation get get through it.,4
150230,David's claim is wrong because the wide and short collected more heat faster and more efficiently.,3
150222,David's claim is ...wrong because ...he said the tall and skinny but what I saw was that the small one grew in a lot shorter time.,3
150238,David's claim is incorrect because maybe the wide and short can absorb Enough heat in a matter of minutes,3
150245,David's claim is incorrect because the wide and short box went up 3 more degrees than the skinny and tall box.,3
150214,David's claim is ...partly right because tall and skinny went down the whole time and short and wide went up the whole time,2
150239,David's claim is ... because ... the Tall and skinny one actually has a smaller window and dosent heat up as fast than the wide and short one that heats up faster.,3
150236,David's claim is not correct because the skinny hole only let in not a lot of heat and the deg Celsius did start to lower.,3
150201,David's claim was wrong. Davids claim was wrong because the skinny and long model went straight and did not reach 40*C. The short and wide model reached 40*C and was still going up.,3
150197,David's claim is incorrect because his claim is incorrect shown by the computer model because the wide and short solar oven heats up faster. This is true because the energy inside the box has more sideways room to move.,3
150163,David's claim is correct  because ...it is getting heated up really fast in less than 2 minutes,2
150159,David's claim is correct because the box has smaller space and the energy doesn't come out.,2
150160,David's claim is incorrect because the short and wide box heated up more in 10 minutes.,3
150165,"David's claim is wrong because if it is tall the suns ,ight will have to drop to the bottom of the box. it will take longer to get heated up because it has to travel more. It has more space.",3
150171,David's claim is wrong because it showed on the graph that it was going down.,3
150154,David's claim is not correct because the small the wide one heats up faster than the tall and skinny one.,3
150166,David's claim is ... because... in the diagram above I picked wide and short and it look's like it works better than the tall and skinny box.,3
150131,"David's claim is partly correct because the skinny and tall box will let in heat and hold as much as it wants, but the small opening does not let that much heat in, in a short period of time.",3
150139,David's claim is wrong  because more heat is coming out of the box in the skinny and tall one and infared radiation is coming out and for the wide and short one the heat is staying traped inside which is making the box more hotter.,3
150140,David's claim is wrong because the wide and short solar oven heats up more than the tall and skinny one.,3
150144,David's claim is not correct because the wide and short box conducted more energy than the skinny and tall box.,3
150143,David's claim is true because if there is a smaller oven window the heat most likely not going to leave.,2
150119,"David's claim is wrong  because the wide and short solar oven heated up faster than the skinny and tall solar oven , that means David is wrong.",3
150129,David's claim is correct because  the tall and skinn one heated up faster then the tall and short one.,2
150148,David's claim is incorrect because the short and wide box released most of the heat that went into the box.,2
150142,David's claim is the tall and skinny box will heat up faster than the wide and short because if he did the model he would find the correct answer.,2
150138,David's claim is ... because ... he did tall and short.,2
150126,David's claim is wrong because like he said not as much heat escaped but not as much got in.,3
150090,David's claim is partly correct because it goes in fast  but also comes out faster,2
150089,David's claim is correct because he said that the skinny and tall oven would be a better solar oven. He is correct because the opening at the top of the oven is smaller then the opening on the short and wide oven. So then now with the tall and skinny oven you will let out less energy.,3
150098,"David's claim is  that he thinks that the skinny and tall oven will heat up faster than the wide and short oven, because the window is smaller so it will let less energy leave the oven. He is partly correct because both ovens heat up at a good amount of speed.",2
150093,"David's claim is wrong because as I did the project with the two boxes the short and wide one went at a higher heat then the tall and skinny. Also I say that he is wrong because he said that tall and skinny would get hotter because the window/door wouldn't let that much heat out of the box, but that not true, because the wide and short one got to a higher heat then the tall and skinny",3
150114,David's claim is ... because ... it was very rong and bad,2
150086,David's claim is ... because ...wide and short is better than skinny and tall,2
150106,David's claim is ... because ...the chart was kind were hot,2

150069,"David's claim is partly correct  because at first, the graph went up but then it went down again.",2
150066,David's claim is wrong because the wide and short one can collect more heat because it has more space to collect it in. The skinny and tall one has a very little space to collect the heat in.,3
150072,"David's claim is incorrect because the tall skinny barely captures any heat cells, but the wide and short captures tons of heat cells.",3
150059,David's claim is ... because... he said that the skinny and tall would heat up faster but the short and wide actually heated up faster than the one that is skinny and tall.,3
149964,"David's claim is partly correct because the temperature went from going up, to staying the same.",2
149950,David's claim is  wrong because more heat went into the small and wide box.,3
149955,David's claim is party  because  so much heat got in but some got out.,2
149947,David's claim is not correct because the short and wide box kept way more heat than the skinny and tall box .,3
149965,David's claim is wrong because he thinks the window is smaller and it will let less energy in. The wide and short one takes a shorter amount of time for the heat to go in.,3
149969,David's claim is wrong because the wide and short box heated up much faster.,3
150650,David's claim is incorrect because the short and wide box traps more heat.,3

150153,David's claim is wrong because the wide and short box heated up faster than the other one,3
150195,David's claim is incorrect because the skinny and tall box does not have much space for sun to come in but it also lets some out after a few minutes.,3
150194,David's claim is not because while the skinny and tall can trap heat better the wide and short can collect more heat all together.,3
150164,David's claim is wrong because the skinny box will not have enough sun going through it.,3
150157,David's claim is wrong because it cept going up and down,2
150200,David's claim is incorrect because a short and wide gets more heat than the skinny and long.,3
150169,David's claim is ... because ...it was working first but then it when down,2
150101,David's claim is ...partly wrong because ... the skinny and tall box heated up really slowly and the heat started to inflate but the wide and short box heated up quickly and stayed heated.,3
150105,"David's claim is incorrect because the tall and skinny box heated up much slower, and it got a lot less hot than the short and wide box.",3
150112,David's claim is wrong because ... IT was doing the opposite of what he said.,2
150085,David's claim is incorrect because in 2 minutes the wide and short box heated up to 44.7 degrees celsius as the skinny and tall box only heated up to 35 degrees celsius.,3
150094,David's claim is wrong because the short model has more surface area,3
150109,David's claim is incorrect because  heat would last longer in a box that is small and short.,3
150080,David's claim is rawn because he didn't look at heat right.,2
150103,David's claim is incorrect according to the data I collected because the wide and short oven heated up much faster and ended at a much higher temperature than the tall and skinny oven.,3
150097,David's claim is ...wrong because ... skinny and tall just attracts heat but then lets most of it go.,2
150095,David's claim is wrong because if you look at the graph then the wider one collected more heat then the long one.,3
150087,David's claim is incorrect because the wide and short box heated up faster the reason why I am saying that it got heated up faster is because it did and it did because all of the arows are pounted down so they hit the wise and short box faster.,3
150096,David's claim is incorrect because the wide and short ones that have more heat in side.,3
150084,David's claim is incorrect because heat can still go through the window even though it's small.,2
150104,David's claim is wrong because the long one did not capture much heat and the short one had much space so the sun light got in,3

150907,"David's claim is wrong  because the short and long one traps the radiation because the part that collects energy is longer, making it easier to collect sunlight, so it collects the conduction faster than the tall and skinny one does. Also, the tall and skinny one, the part that collects all the sunlight is way smaller than the long and skinny one, letting all the energy escape.",4
150905,David's claim is incorrect and I don't know why.,2
151224,David's claim is wrong because the wide box has a bigger opening for heat to come in and although it has a big opening doesn't mean it will be cooler.,3

151210,David's claim is .,1
151226,David's claim is no because the skinny and tall was getting low. But the wide and short was getting higher. the skinny and tall was to tall so the radiation was getting low. The wide and short was short enough for the radiation to get in side the wide and short.,3
151211,this claim is incorrect because he did not state a claim.,2

150917,"David's claim is incorrect because the wide and short is normally going up but near the end it stayed the same temperature. It reached the low 80s and high 70s. For the tall and thin, for a few seconds it went up but then it turned into a low slope. When it reached 2 minutes it was in the 30s but slowly stayed the same. Near at 4 minutes it started going down. It kinda went up but normally just stayed the same.",3
151176,David's claim is incorrect because he said that the tall and skinny box would heat faster and the short and wide box heated faster than the tall and skinny box.,3
151198,David's claim is wrong because he said that the tall and skinny box would heat up faster than the short and wide box,2
151174,David's claim is .correct.. because the whole is smaller less energy will get out,2
150918,"David's claim is incorrect.  This is because when I tested the graph, very tiny heat dots appeared very slowly.  This shows that the skinny and taller heat oven would take more time to heat up.  The movement of the heat energy would allow the wide and short oven to heat up faster, because the wide and short heat oven has more open space to let in more heat energy at a time at a quicker pace.  Also, the skinny oven has a very skinny open space and is very long and deep, so it would take longer to fill up the whole heat oven. The sun's rays will heat the wide and short oven faster because it has a flat shape.  That is why David is incorrect.",5
151190,David's claim is partly correct because he didnt give a very good reason but he answer was correct.,2
151181,David's claim is wrong because the graph showed the heat increasing and the little heat balls in the oven were increasing by the second.,3

151212,"David's claim is not correct  because the skinny and tall box reached 30.6 degrees Celsius in a longer amount of time than the wide and short box, which reached 30.6 Celsius in 2.72 minutes and the skinny and tall box reached 30.6 in 3.98 minutes. Most of the solar energy went to the wide and short box, and there was more heat in the wide and short box from the solar energy. The skinny and tall box usually had solar energy escaping from the box. This is why the wide and short box heated up faster than the skinny and tall box.",5
